**CONFIDENTIAL PRELIMINARY OFFERING**
**MEMORANDUM SUPPLEMENT**


**NOT FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


**$340,000,000 5[ 3]/8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025**

**issued by**

**UPCB Finance IV Limited**

UPCB Finance IV Limited, incorporated as an exempted company limited by shares under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the

“Issuer”) and owned 100% by a charitable trust, is offering $340 million aggregate principal amount of its 5[ 3]/8% senior secured notes due
2025 (the “Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes are being offered as additional notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of
April 15, 2015 (the “Original Issue Date”) by and among, inter alios, the Issuer, as Issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon, London
Branch, as Trustee, pursuant to which the Issuer issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of its 5[ 3]/8% senior secured notes due 2025
(the “Original Dollar Notes” and, together with the Additional Notes, the “Dollar Notes”) and €600 million aggregate principal amount of
its 4% senior secured notes due 2027 (the “Euro Notes” and, together with the Original Dollar Notes, the “Original Notes”). The Additional
Notes and the Original Dollar Notes will be treated as a single class under the Indenture for purposes of redemptions and offers to purchase
and, except as otherwise stated herein, the Additional Notes and the Original Notes will be treated as a single class for all other purposes
under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers and amendments. The Dollar Notes will mature on January 15, 2025. The Issuer will
pay interest on the Dollar Notes semi-annually in cash on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2016. Interest on the
Additional Notes will accrue from the Original Issue Date.


The Original Dollar Notes were offered pursuant to an offering memorandum dated March 31, 2015 (the “Original Offering

**Memorandum”). The Original Offering Memorandum is attached as Annex B to this offering memorandum supplement (the “Supplement”,**
and together with the Original Offering Memorandum, the “Offering Memorandum”). This Supplement supplements the Original Offering
Memorandum and supersedes information in the Original Offering Memorandum to the extent inconsistent with information included in the
Supplement. Unless so supplemented or modified, information in the Original Offering Memorandum is current as of the date of this
Supplement. Investors should read the Original Offering Memorandum together with this Supplement in connection with any decision to
invest in the Additional Notes. The Additional Notes and the Original Notes are referred to in this Supplement as the “Notes”. Capitalized
terms used in this Supplement and not otherwise defined in this Supplement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Original
Offering Memorandum.

The proceeds from the offering of the Additional Notes will be used by the Issuer to fund an additional facility under the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility (as defined in this Offering Memorandum) (the “Additional Dollar Finco Loan”), denominated in U.S.
dollars and borrowed by UPC Financing Partnership (“UPC Financing”). Each of the Additional Dollar Finco Loan and the additional
facility under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility funded with the proceeds of the Original Dollar Notes (the “Original Dollar Finco
**Loan”) will have substantially the same terms and will constitute a “Finco Loan” for purposes of the Indenture and related documents and,**
together, will be deemed to constitute a single additional facility for purposes of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.  The Additional
Dollar Finco Loan and the Original Dollar Finco Loan are collectively referred to in this Supplement as the “Dollar Finco Loan”. UPC
Financing is an entity indirectly wholly-owned by UPC Holding B.V. (“UPC Holding”). The Issuer is dependent upon payments under the
Additional Dollar Finco Loan and related agreements to make payments under the Additional Notes. The Issuer will apply payments it
receives under the Additional Dollar Finco Loan and such related agreements, including in respect of principal, premiums and interest, to
make corresponding payments under the Additional Notes.


The accession agreements related to the Dollar Finco Loan will provide for the payment of certain premiums in connection with

certain voluntary and mandatory prepayments of the Dollar Finco Loan that will enable the Issuer to pay the premiums payable in respect of
corresponding redemptions of the Dollar Notes, as described in “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase”. Some or all of the
Dollar Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to January 15, 2020, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the redemption date and the “make whole” premium, as described in this
Offering Memorandum. The Dollar Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after January 15, 2020 at the redemption prices set forth in this
Offering Memorandum. In addition, at any time prior to January 15, 2018, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the Dollar Notes with the net
proceeds of one or more specified equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Prior to January 15, 2020,
during each 12-month period commencing on the Original Issue Date, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the principal amount of the Dollar
Notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the redemption
date.

Following a change of control as defined under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, UPC Broadband Holding B.V. (“UPC

**Broadband Holding”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC Holding, and UPC Financing will be required to, at the election of the Majority**
Lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, prepay the Dollar Finco Loan plus a payment equal to 1% of the principal amount
of the Dollar Finco Loan. Following such repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Dollar Notes issued under the Indenture at a
redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. See “Description
_of the Notes—Redemption upon a Change of Control”. In the event of certain asset sales, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing may_


-----

elect, at their option, to (i) offer to prepay a principal amount of the Dollar Finco Loan in an aggregate amount equal to the principal amount
of the Dollar Notes tendered in the related asset sale offer to be made by the Issuer (not to exceed the available proceeds from the related
asset sale) or (ii) subject to the payment of certain premiums, repay the Dollar Finco Loan pro rata with the other Finco Loans (as defined in
the Offering Memorandum) in an amount equal to the available proceeds from the related asset sale, and, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) of
this sentence, the Issuer will redeem a corresponding amount of the Dollar Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption and
_Repurchase—Disposal Proceeds”. Further, the Dollar Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and_
unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law and, subject to certain limitations, in connection with a UPC Exchange
Transaction (as defined in this Offering Memorandum). See “Description of the Notes—Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes” and
“Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—Special Optional Redemption in connection with a UPC Exchange Transaction”.

Neither UPC Holding nor any of its subsidiaries will guarantee or provide any credit support to the Issuer with respect to its

obligations under the Dollar Notes. Other than under the limited circumstances described herein, holders of the Dollar Notes will not have a
direct claim on the cash flow or assets of UPC Holding or any of its subsidiaries, and neither UPC Holding nor any of its subsidiaries has any
obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Dollar Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments,
other than the obligations of UPC Financing to make payments to the Issuer pursuant to the Dollar Finco Loan and agreements related
thereto.

The Original Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, senior obligations of the Issuer. The Original Notes are, and the

Additional Notes will be, secured by, among other things, a first ranking security interest over the Issuer’s rights to and benefit in the Finco
Loans (including all rights of the Issuer as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility). In addition, other than in certain
limited circumstances specified herein, holders of the Original Notes and the Additional Notes will not have any recourse to the Issuer other
than in respect of amounts received by the Issuer under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the related agreements. For a
description of the terms of the Notes, see “Description of the Notes”.

See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15 of this Supplement and “Risk Factors” beginning on page 30 of the Original Offering

Memorandum for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with an investment in any of the Additional Notes.

The Dollar Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S.

**Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Issuer is offering the Additional Notes only to qualified institutional**
buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in accordance with
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. For a description of certain restrictions on the transfer of the Dollar Notes see “Plan of
_Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”._

Application will be made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Additional Notes to be admitted to listing on its Official List and

trading on its Global Exchange Market.

The Additional Notes will be in registered form in denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Additional Notes will be represented on issue by one or more global notes, which will be delivered through The Depository Trust
Company (“DTC”), on or about (the “Issue Date”). The Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act

will have different international securities identification numbers and CUSIP numbers from, and will not trade fungibly with, the Original
Dollar Notes during the period prior to and including the 40[th] day following the Issue Date. After the 40[th] day following the Issue Date,
certain selling restrictions with respect to the Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, will terminate
and the Additional Notes will become fully fungible with, and have the same international securities identification numbers and CUSIP
numbers as, the Original Dollar Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Interests in the global Additional Notes
will be exchangeable for the relevant definitive Additional Notes only in certain limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and

**Additional Notes.**

**The Issuer and the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers are offering to sell the Additional Notes only in places**

**where offers and sales are permitted.**

The Issuer is offering the Additional Notes in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S.

Securities Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Dollar Notes
have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or
any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such securities commission or authority passed
upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Offering Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the
United States.

This Offering Memorandum is being provided for informational use solely in connection with consideration of a

purchase of the Additional Notes (i) to U.S. investors that the Issuer reasonably believes to be qualified institutional buyers as
defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, and (ii) to certain persons in offshore transactions complying with
Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This
Offering Memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part nor may it be distributed or any of its contents be
disclosed to anyone other than the qualified institutional buyers described in (i) above or to persons considering a purchase of
the Additional Notes in offshore transactions described in (ii) above.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) are investment professionals, as such term is

defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the
“Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies,
unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons

lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).
This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to

pursuant to an exemption under Article 3 of Directive 2003/71/EC as amended (including by Directive 2010/73/EU) (the
“Prospectus Directive”), as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), from the
requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Additional Notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make
any offer within the EEA of the Additional Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the
Issuer or any of the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. None of the Issuer, UPC
Holding or the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers has authorized, nor does any of them authorize, the making of any offer of
the Additional Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers
which constitute the final placement of the Additional Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

except as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws. See “Plan of Distribution” and

revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer and UPC Holding disclose important factors that could cause their actual results to differ materially from

their expectations in this Offering Memorandum. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements
attributable to the Issuer or UPC Holding or persons acting on their behalf. When UPC Holding indicates that an event,
condition or circumstance could or would have an adverse effect on it, it means to include effects upon business, financial and
other conditions, results of operations and ability to make payments on the Finco Loans, which in turn would have an adverse
effect on the Issuer’s ability to make payments under the Additional Notes.

**BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE OFFERING OF THE ADDITIONAL NOTES**

_This description of the offering of the Additional Notes highlights selected information contained in this Offering_

_Memorandum regarding the Additional Notes. It does not contain all the information you should consider prior to investing in_
_the Additional Notes. You should read the entire Offering Memorandum carefully including the “Risk Factors”, the financial_
_statements and notes thereto, and the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations” included in this Offering Memorandum._

The Issuer is offering $340 million aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes. The Additional Notes will

constitute “Additional Notes” under the Indenture pursuant to which the Issuer issued the Original Dollar Notes and the Euro
Notes on the Original Issue Date. The Additional Notes and the Original Dollar Notes will be treated as a single class under the
Indenture for purposes of redemptions and offers to purchase and, except as otherwise stated herein, the Additional Notes and
the Original Notes will be treated as a single class for all other purposes under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers
and amendments. Any reference to the “Notes” or “Dollar Notes” under “Description of the Notes” in the Original Offering
Memorandum shall be deemed to include the Additional Notes and such Additional Notes will be, if issued, subject to the
same covenants as the Original Dollar Notes and the Original Notes, as applicable, issued under the Indenture on the Original
Issue Date.

In connection with the issuance of the Original Dollar Notes, the Issuer entered into an additional facility accession

agreement (the “Finco Accession Agreement AL”) with UPC Financing and the facility agent under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility pursuant to which the Issuer made available to UPC Financing the Original Dollar Finco Loan, in a
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Original Dollar Notes. In connection with the issuance of the
Additional Notes offered hereby, the Issuer will enter into an additional accession agreement (the “Finco Accession
**Agreement AL2”) with UPC Financing and the facility agent under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility pursuant to**
which the Issuer will make available to UPC Financing the Additional Dollar Finco Loan in a principal amount equal to the
aggregate principal amount of the Additional Notes issued in the offering. The terms of the Finco Accession Agreement AL
and the Finco Accession Agreement AL2 will be substantially the same, and the Original Dollar Finco Loan advanced under
the Finco Accession Agreement AL and the Additional Dollar Finco Loan advanced under the Finco Accession Agreement
AL2 will be deemed to constitute a single additional facility for purposes of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. The
Facility AL2 Accession Agreement will constitute a “Finco Accession Agreement” and the Additional Dollar Finco Loan will
constitute a “Finco Loan” for purposes of the Indenture and related documents. Accordingly, any references to “Finco
_Accession Agreement AL”, “Facility AL Finco Accession Agreement”, “Finco Loan AL”, “Finco Loans”, “Facility AL” and_
“Finco Facilities”, as applicable, under “Description of the Notes” and elsewhere in the Original Offering Memorandum shall
be deemed to include the Finco Accession Agreement AL2 and the Additional Dollar Finco Loan, as applicable. The form of
the Finco Accession Agreement AL2 is set forth in Annex A to this Supplement and the form of the Finco Accession
Agreement AL is set forth in Annex B to the Original Offering Memorandum. For a further description of the terms of the
Notes and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, including the rights and protections granted to the Issuer as a UPCB
Lender, see “Description of the Notes” and “Description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility” in the Original
Offering Memorandum.

UPC Financing intends to use the proceeds from the Additional Dollar Finco Loan, together with the proceeds of an

additional advance in an aggregate principal amount of €100.0 million it intends to draw under the UPC Holding Subordinated
Shareholder Loans (the “May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance”) and existing cash and cash
equivalents of UPC Holding and its subsidiaries, to (i) repay the May Facility AI Additional Net Borrowings (as defined below)
in full (the “May Facility AI Prepayment”), (ii) pay certain fees and expenses payable to the Issuer under the Additional
Notes Fee Letter and (iii) for general corporate purposes, which may include loans, distributions or other payments to UPC
Holding and its direct or indirect parent companies. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization of UPC Holding and the
_Issuer”._

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF UPC HOLDING**

**_Preliminary Operating and Statistical Data of UPC Holding for the First Quarter of 2015_**

For UPC Holding’s selected preliminary unaudited financial and operating information for the three months ended

March 31, 2015, see “Annex C” beginning on Page C-1 of this Supplement. The information contained in Annex C is
preliminary and has not been reviewed by UPC Holding’s independent auditors and is subject to change prior to UPC Holding
issuing its unaudited condensed consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Accordingly,
UPC Holding’s actual results for the three months ended March 31, 2015 may vary from the preliminary results and estimates
contained in Annex C, and such variations could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on them. See
“Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect
our future performance and results of operations.

**_The Refinancing_**

On the Original Issue Date, the Issuer issued the Original Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes under the Indenture. On

the Original Issue Date, the Issuer used (i) the net proceeds from the Original Dollar Notes, together with fees payable to it by
UPC Financing under a fee letter between the Issuer and UPC Financing dated on the Original Issue Date (the “Original Notes
**Fee Letter”), to fund the Original Dollar Finco Loan and (ii) the net proceeds from the Euro Notes, together with fees payable**
to it by UPC Financing under the Original Notes Fee Letter, to fund a loan in the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes
to UPC Financing under an additional facility (Facility AK) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (the “Euro
**Finco Loan” and, together with the Original Dollar Finco Loan, the “Original Finco Loans”). The Euro Finco Loan and the**
Dollar Finco Loans are collectively referred to in this Supplement as the “Finco Loans” and each a “Finco Loan”.

UPC Financing applied the proceeds from the Original Finco Loans to:

(i) repay 10% of the principal amount outstanding under each of Facility Z, Facility AC and Facility AD under
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and related premium,
to UPCB Finance III Limited, UPCB Finance V Limited and UPCB Finance VI Limited, respectively, and
UPCB Finance III Limited, UPCB Finance V Limited and UPCB Finance VI Limited applied the proceeds
of such repayment to redeem 10% of the principal amount of each series of the outstanding UPCB III Senior
Secured Notes, UPCB V Senior Secured Notes and the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes, respectively, at a
redemption price equal to 103% of such principal amount in accordance with the applicable indenture
governing the notes (the “10% Redemptions”);

(ii) repay the remaining €190.0 million principal amount outstanding under Facility Y under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and related premium, to UPCB Finance II
Limited and UPCB Finance II Limited applied the proceeds of such repayment to redeem the remaining
€190.0 million aggregate principal amount of the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes (the “UPCB II Senior
**Secured Notes Redemption”);**

(iii) repay the remaining $900.0 million principal amount outstanding under Facility Z under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility, following the 10% Redemptions, together with accrued and unpaid interest and
related premium, to UPCB Finance III Limited and UPCB Finance III Limited applied the proceeds of such
repayment to redeem the remaining $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of the UPCB III Senior
Secured Notes (the “UPCB III Senior Secured Notes Redemption”); and

(iv) repay the Facility AI Net Borrowings (the “Facility AI Repayment” and, together with the 10%
Redemptions, the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes Redemption and the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes
Redemption, the “Refinancing”).

2


-----

**_May Facility AI Additional Net Borrowings_**

During May 2015, a net aggregate principal amount of €400 million was borrowed under Facility AI of the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility (the “May Facility AI Additional Net Borrowings”). We used substantially all of the
proceeds of the May Facility AI Additional Net Borrowings to repay a portion of the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder
Loans (the “May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Partial Repayment”).

**_Potential Additional Financing Transactions_**

UPC Holding continually evaluates different financing alternatives and may decide to enter into new credit facilities,

access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation of this
offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Additional Notes (the “Potential Financing
**Transactions”). The proceeds of any Potential Financing Transactions may be used to refinance indebtedness or for general**
corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or loans, distributions or other payments to UPC Holding and its direct or
indirect parent companies. Any such Potential Financing Transactions would be incurred in compliance with the applicable
covenants under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the indentures governing the UPCB Notes and the indentures
governing the UPCH Notes, up to a maximum ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to as adjusted annualized
EBITDA of 4.00 to 1.00 and a maximum ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to as adjusted annualized EBITDA of 5.00
to 1.00, calculated as set forth under the heading “Certain As Adjusted Covenant Information” in this Supplement. Any
Potential Financing Transaction will be made at UPC Holding’s election or the election of its relevant subsidiaries, and if such
debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering
memorandum. See “Risk Factors–UPC Holding may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period
_following, the Issue Date of the Additional Notes, which indebtedness could increase its leverage and may have terms that are_
_more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and UPC Holding’s other existing indebtedness” in this Supplement._

**As of and for the six-month period ended**

**March 31, 2015(1)**

**in millions, except ratios**

Annualized EBITDA (2) ........................................................................................ €1,255.5

As adjusted annualized EBITDA (3) ..................................................................... €1,143.8

As adjusted total covenant senior net debt (4)(5) .................................................. €3,772.3

(1) The as adjusted covenant information presented in this table is as of March 31, 2015, based on the selected preliminary
unaudited financial information contained in “Annex C” beginning on page C-1 of this Supplement. The information
contained in Annex C is preliminary and has not been reviewed by UPC Holding’s independent auditors and is subject to
change prior to UPC Holding issuing its March 31, 2014 unaudited consolidated financial statements. See “Annex C:
_UPC Holding’s selected operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2015” and “Risk factors―_
_Risks Relating to the Notes and Structure―The selected operating and financial information reported under the caption_
_“Recent Developments — Preliminary Operating and Statistical Data of UPC Holding for the First Quarter of 2015” in_
_Annex C for the three months ended March 31, 2015 is preliminary and may change” in this Supplement._

(2) Annualized EBITDA is calculated by multiplying EBITDA (as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility),
including the impact of (i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC NL Transfer and (iii) the Corporate Entities Transfer
for the six months ended March 31, 2015 (€627.8 million) by two. Annualized EBITDA and EBITDA may differ from
the segment operating cash flow amounts reported for the corresponding periods.

(3) As adjusted annualized EBITDA includes allocated costs of €111.7 million related to the “Operating and SG&A related
(exclusive of depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation)” category of related-party fees and
allocations, net, as described above under “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma Financial Statement and Operating Data
_of UPC Holding”. These allocated costs include the impact of Liberty Global’s acquisition of Ziggo Holding B.V._
(formerly Ziggo N.V.) and the resulting decrease in costs allocated to UPC Holding.

(4) As adjusted total covenant senior net debt is calculated for the subsidiaries of UPC Holding and does not include debt of
UPC Holding.

(5) As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant net debt are calculated in accordance with the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and are adjusted to give effect to the Early 2015 Refinancings, the issuance of
the Original Notes and the funding of the Original Finco Loans and the application of the proceeds therefrom to
complete the Refinancing, the May Facility AI Additional Net Borrowings and the application of the proceeds therefrom
to complete the May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Partial Repayment, the May UPC Holding
Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance, and the issuance of the Additional Notes offered hereby and the funding of the
Additional Dollar Finco Loan and the application of the proceeds therefrom, together with the proceeds from the May
UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance and existing cash and cash equivalents of UPC Holding and its
subsidiaries, to complete the May Facility AI Prepayment, as applicable. As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and
as adjusted total covenant net debt presented here differ from the calculation of “Indebtedness” under the “Consolidated
Leverage Ratio” under certain of the indentures governing the UPC Holding Senior Notes. The amounts shown take into
account currency swaps and do not include deferred financing fees, accrued interest, premiums or discounts, and
accordingly, may differ from the debt figures that are reported under “Capitalization of UPC Holding and the Issuer”. In
the event that any Potential Financing Transaction is entered into, (i) the amount of as adjusted total covenant senior net
debt may increase, and, accordingly, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant senior net debt to as adjusted annualized
EBITDA may increase, up to a maximum ratio of 4.00x, and (ii) the amount of as adjusted total covenant net debt may
increase, and, accordingly, the ratio of as adjusted total covenant net debt to as adjusted annualized EBITDA may
increase, up to a maximum ratio of 5.00x. See “Risk Factors–UPC Holding may incur additional indebtedness prior to,
_or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Additional Notes, which indebtedness could increase its_
_leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and UPC Holding’s other_
_existing indebtedness” in this Supplement._

and the Original Notes will be treated as a single class for all other purposes under the Indenture
including with respect to waivers and amendments.


**Maturity date** January 15, 2025.

**Interest rate** 5.375%.

**Interest payment dates** Semi-annually in arrears on each January 15 and July 15, commencing January 15, 2016. Interest
will accrue from the Original Issue Date.

**Denomination** Each Additional Note will have a minimum denomination of $200,000 and be in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess of $200,000. Additional Notes in denominations of less than
$200,000 will not be available.

**UPC Broadband Holding**
**Bank Facility**


The net proceeds from the issuance of the Additional Notes, together with fees paid to the Issuer
by UPC Financing under under a fee letter between the Issuer and UPC Financing to be dated on
or about the Issue Date (the “Additional Notes Fee Letter” and together with the Original Notes
Fee Letter, the “Fee Letters” and each a Fee Letter”), will be used by the Issuer to fund a loan,
denominated in U.S. dollars, under an additional facility borrowed by UPC Financing under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (the “Additional Dollar Finco Loan”), including any
premium, if applicable, payable to UPC Financing under the accession agreement related to the
Additional Dollar Finco Loan. Each of the Additional Dollar Finco Loan and the additional
facility under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility funded with the proceeds of the Original
Dollar Notes (the “Original Dollar Finco Loan” and, together with the Additional Dollar Finco
Loan, the “Dollar Finco Loan”) will have substantially the same terms and will constitute a
“Finco Loan” for purposes of the Indenture and related documents and, together, will be deemed
to constitute a single additional facility for purposes of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility. Under the terms of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the related
arrangements, the Issuer will benefit from, among other things, all the rights of a lender under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.


**Limited recourse** Except under the limited circumstances specified under “Description of the Notes—Events of
_Default and Remedies”, the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Dollar Notes and the_
Notes Security Documents (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) will be solely to make
payments of amounts in aggregate equivalent to the amounts actually received by or for the
account of the Issuer from UPC Financing under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and
agreements related thereto.

In addition, other than under the limited circumstances described under “Description of the
_Notes—Events of Default and Remedies”, holders of the Dollar Notes will not have a direct claim_

-----

on the cash flow or assets of UPC Holding or its subsidiaries and UPC Holding and its
subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Dollar
Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the obligations of
UPC Financing to make payments to lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
and agreements related thereto.

Neither UPC Holding nor any of its subsidiaries will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the
Dollar Notes.

**Security** The holders of the Dollar Notes will benefit directly from first-ranking security interests granted
to the Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Dollar Notes in the following
rights, property and assets:

(1) all of the issued shares of the Issuer;

(2) all of the assets of the Issuer (excluding the proceeds of the paid up share capital of the
Issuer and any transaction fees payable to the Issuer pursuant to the Expenses Agreement
and excluding as provided below) including:

(a) the Issuer’s rights to and benefit in the Dollar Finco Loan (including all rights
of the Issuer as a UPCB Lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility, the Finco Accession Agreement AL and the Finco Accession
Agreement AL2);

(b) the Issuer’s rights under the Deed of Covenant;

(c) the Issuer’s rights under the Fee Letters;

(d) the Issuer’s rights under the Expenses Agreement (excluding the Issuer’s rights
to be indemnified in respect of fees, costs, expenses and any other amounts
payable to parties that do not benefit from the security interests in the
Collateral); and

(e) sums of money held from time to time in all bank accounts of the Issuer
(excluding the bank account in which the Issuer has deposited the proceeds of
its share capital ($250.00) and the transaction fee ($250.00)).

The Issuer, as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, will be treated the same
as all other lenders under that facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are
similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other UPCB Lenders. Through the
covenants in the Indenture and the security interests over all of the issued shares of the Issuer and
the Dollar Finco Loan granted to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Dollar Notes, the
holders of the Dollar Notes will be provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and protections
granted to the Issuer as a UPCB Lender, including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained
in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and of the security granted for the benefit of the
UPCB Lenders.

**Mandatory redemption** Following a change of control as defined under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, UPC
Broadband Holding and UPC Financing will be required to, at the election of the Majority
Lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, prepay the Dollar Finco Loan plus a
payment equal to 1% of the principal amount of the Dollar Finco Loan. Following such
repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Dollar Notes issued under the Indenture at a
redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of redemption.

**Optional redemption** In the event that all or any portion of the Dollar Finco Loan is voluntarily prepaid by UPC
Broadband Holding pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary Prepayment) of the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility (an “Early Redemption Event”), subject to and in accordance with the
terms of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Finco Accession Agreement AL
provides and the Finco Accession Agreement AL2 will provide for the payment of certain
additional payments to be made to the Issuer that correspond to the premiums payable to holders

**Optional redemption with**

**with a UPC Exchange**
**Transaction**


of the Dollar Notes upon early redemption, as described below.

At any time prior to January 15, 2020, upon the occurrence of any Early Redemption Event, the
Issuer will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes equal to the principal
amount of the Dollar Finco Loan prepaid in such Early Redemption Event (not to exceed 10% of
the Dollar Notes during each twelve month period commencing on the Issue Date), at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
to (but excluding) the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption and
_Repurchase—Optional Redemption”._

At any time prior to January 15, 2020, upon the occurrence of any Early Redemption Event, the
Issuer will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes equal to the principal
amount of the Dollar Finco Loan prepaid in such Early Redemption Event by paying a “make
whole” premium as described under “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—
_Optional Redemption”._

On or after January 15, 2020, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event, the Issuer will
redeem an aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes equal to the principal amount of the
Dollar Finco Loan prepaid in such Early Redemption Event at the redemption prices as described
under “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—Optional Redemption”.

At any time prior to January 15, 2018, upon the occurrence of any Early Redemption Event with
the net proceeds of one of more specified equity offerings (the “Equity Offering Early
**Redemption** **Proceeds”), the Issuer will redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of**
the Dollar Notes equal to the principal amount of the Finco Loan AL prepaid with any Equity
Offering Early Redemption Proceeds in such Early Redemption Event, at the redemption price as
set forth under “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—Optional Redemption”.

In the event of certain asset sales, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing may elect, at their
option, to (i) offer to prepay a principal amount of the Dollar Finco Loan in an amount equal to
the principal amount of the Dollar Notes tendered in the related asset sale offer to be made by the
Issuer (not to exceed the available proceeds from the related asset sale) or (ii) subject to the
payment of certain premiums, repay the Dollar Finco Loan in an amount equal to the available
proceeds from the related asset sale, and, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) the Issuer will redeem a
corresponding amount of the Dollar Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption and
_Repurchase—Disposal Proceeds”._

At any time following the Issue Date, the Issuer may, at its option, initiate a UPC Exchange
Transaction, pursuant to which it will make an offer to all holders of the Dollar Notes to exchange
their Dollar Notes for senior secured notes issued by UPC Broadband Holding or UPC Financing.

If, among other requirements, a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Dollar Notes elect to participate in such UPC Exchange Transaction and UPC Broadband Holding
or UPC Financing, as the case may be, accepts for exchange all Dollar Notes tendered in such
UPC Exchange Transaction, UPC Broadband Holding or UPC Financing, as the case may be, will
be entitled to prepay all, but not less than all, of the remaining principal amount of the
corresponding Dollar Finco Loan. In order to effect any such prepayment, either UPC Broadband
Holding or UPC Financing, as the case may be, is required to give notice of such prepayment to
the Issuer not later than three Business Days prior to the completion of such UPC Exchange
Transaction and make such prepayment on the completion date of such UPC Exchange
Transaction.

The Issuer will redeem all, but not less than all, of the Dollar Notes issued under the Indenture not
exchanged in the UPC Exchange Transaction on the date of the prepayment of the Dollar Finco
Loan described above, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

A UPC Exchange Transaction means an exchange offer by UPC Broadband or UPC Financing, as
applicable, pursuant to which UPC Qualified Notes (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) are

7


-----

**Additional amounts; tax**
**redemption**


offered in exchange for all outstanding Dollar Notes issued under the Indenture; provided, that:

(i) no Default or Event of Default (each as defined in “Description of the Notes”) has
occurred and is continuing at the time any such exchange offer is made or would result
therefrom;

(ii) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Dollar Notes have
elected to participate in such offer;

(iii) for each $1,000 in principal amount of Dollar Notes tendered and accepted, each holder
tendering such Dollar Notes will receive $1,000 in principal amount of UPC Qualified
Notes;

(iv) the exchange offer complies with Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any

other applicable securities law or regulation;

(v) UPC Broadband or UPC Financing, as applicable, accepts for exchange all Dollar Notes
tendered in such exchange offer and issues the relevant UPC Qualified Notes in exchange
therefor;

(vi) the exchange offer is open to all holders of the Dollar Notes on substantially similar terms,
subject to certain exceptions described under “Description of the Notes”; and

(vii) the exchange offer is not conditioned upon holders of the Dollar Notes consenting to any
amendments to the terms of the Dollar Notes or the Indenture.

All payments in respect of the Dollar Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for
any taxes or other governmental charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or
deduction is required by law, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will pay additional amounts
so that the net amount you receive is no less than that which you would have received in the
absence of such withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”.
The Issuer may redeem the Dollar Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving prior
notice, in the event of an optional prepayment of the Dollar Finco Loan pursuant to Clause
7.9(a)(i) (Right of prepayment and cancellation in relation to a single Lender) of the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility or if certain changes in tax law impose certain withholding
taxes on amounts payable on the Notes and, as a result, the Issuer is required to pay additional
amounts with respect to such withholding taxes. If the Issuer decides to exercise such redemption
right, it must pay holders a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Dollar Notes
being redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—Redemption for Changes in
_Withholding Taxes”._


**Certain covenants** The Issuer will issue the Additional Notes as “Additional Notes” under the Indenture. The
Indenture will contain restrictive covenants with respect to business activities of the Issuer;
maintenance of the existence of the Issuer; maintenance of listing; minimum period for consents
under the Loan Documents; payments for consent; amendments to the Loan Documents to be
applied equally to all lenders; and information.


**Voting in respect of the**
**Finco Loan and the UPC**
**Broadband Holding Bank**
**Facility**


The Issuer will vote as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility pursuant to the
Dollar Finco Loan. The voting method to be used to determine the voting position of the Issuer on
any matter subject to a lender vote under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is described
under “Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the UPC Broadband
_Holding Bank Facility or the Finco Accession Agreements”._

The Finco Accession Agreement AL contains, and the Finco Accession Agreement AL2 will
contain, the advance consent of the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, to certain amendments to the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility that UPC Broadband Holding may request in the future.
Although the Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other UPCB Lenders in all matters
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Issuer has given its consent to any and all
of such amendments when it entered into the Finco Accession Agreement AL and will give its
consent to any and all of such amendments at the time it enters into the Finco Accession

Agreement AL2 and, therefore, will not be entitled to vote on any future request for consent to
such amendments. As a result, the holders of Dollar Notes will not, directly or indirectly, be
entitled to direct the vote of the Issuer on such matters. Pursuant to the Finco Accession
Agreement AL the Issuer has consented, and pursuant to the Finco Accession Agreement AL2
will consent, to certain amendments which include, among other provisions, the following

The above description is intended to summarize certain material amendments included in the
Finco Accession Agreement AL and Finco Accession Agreement AL2 but is not complete and
exhaustive and does not restate the proposed amendments listed in schedule 3 of each of the Finco
Accession Agreement AL and Finco Accession Agreement AL2 in its entirety. These
amendments provide significant additional flexibility to UPC Holding and its subsidiaries in
operating their business, including additional flexibility to incur indebtedness, make restricted
payments, and acquire and dispose of assets. Given the significant nature of these amendments,
you should read the full list of amendments set out in schedule 3 of the Finco Accession
Agreement AL2 listed in Annex A of this Supplement in its entirety before investing in the
Additional Notes. See “Risk Factors—By investing in the Dollar Notes you will have provided
_advanced consent to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments which will_
_automatically become effective without any further consent from holders of the Dollar Notes upon_
_UPC Broadband Holding obtaining the consent of either the Majority Lenders (as defined in the_
_UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility) or, with respect to certain amendments, all UPCB_
_Lenders”._

In the event UPC Broadband Holding solicits the consents for any or all of the amendments to the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility described above, the Issuer will not be entitled to receive
any consent fee or similar fee that may be paid to other lenders under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility in connection with their approval of these amendments (although UPC

12

Broadband Holding will generally be required to pay to the Issuer the same consent fee that it
pays to other lenders with respect to other amendments). See “Description of the Notes—Finco
_Accession Agreements and the UPC_ _Broadband Holding Bank Facility” and “Description of the_
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Payments for Consent”._

registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan of
_Distribution”._

The Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will have
different CUSIP numbers and international securities identification numbers (as applicable) from,
and will not be fungible with, the Original Dollar Notes during the period prior to and including
the 40[th] day following the Issue Date. After the 40[th] day following the Issue Date, certain selling
restrictions with respect to the Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act will terminate and the Additional Notes will become fully fungible with, and have
the same CUSIP number and international securities identification number as, the Original Dollar
Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Please see “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_

**Absence of a public market Although the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers have informed the Issuer and UPC Holding that**
**for the Notes** they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they

may discontinue market making at any time without notice. Accordingly, neither the Issuer nor
UPC Holding can assure you that a liquid market for the Additional Notes will develop or be
maintained.

Holding and its subsidiaries, to (i) fund the May Facility AI Prepayment, (ii) pay certain fees and
expenses payable to the Issuer under the Additional Notes Fee Letter, and (iii) for general
corporate purposes, which may include loans, distributions or other payments to UPC Holding

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Additional Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Additional Notes, you should consider_

_carefully the specific risk factors set forth beginning on page 30 of the Original Offering Memorandum, the amended risk_
_factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Offering Memorandum. If any of the events described_
_below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could have a material adverse impact on the Issuer’s and UPC_
_Holding’s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition and could therefore have a negative effect on the_
_trading price of the Dollar Notes and UPC Holding’s ability to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Dollar Finco_
_Loan, and in turn, would have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Dollar Notes. Although_
_described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum are the risks considered to be the most material, there may be_
_other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material_
_adverse effects on the Issuer’s or UPC Holding’s business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition in the_
_future. In addition, past financial performance of UPC Holding may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and_
_historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual_

_results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,_
_including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Relating to UPC Holding’s Financial Profile**

**_UPC Holding’s substantial leverage could adversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations and_**

**_financial condition and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under the Finco Loans, and in turn, prevent the Issuer from_**
**_fulfilling its obligations under the Notes._**

UPC Holding is highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2014, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Early

2015 Refinancings, the issuance of the Original Notes and the funding of the Original Finco Loans and the application of the
proceeds therefrom to complete the Refinancing, the May Facility AI Additional Net Borrowings and the application of the
proceeds therefrom to complete the May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Partial Repayment, the May UPC
Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance, and the issuance of the Additional Notes offered hereby and the funding of
the Additional Dollar Finco Loan and the application of the proceeds therefrom, together with the proceeds from the May UPC
Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance and existing cash and cash equivalents of UPC Holding and its subsidiaries,
to complete the May Facility AI Prepayment, the carrying amount of UPC Holding’s total consolidated third-party debt and
capital lease obligations would have been approximately €5.6 billion (excluding approximately €5.1 billion of UPC Holding
Shareholder Subordinated Loans). Of this as adjusted indebtedness, €1.3 billion (equivalent) represents the aggregate principal
amount outstanding under the UPCH Notes, €1.1 billion (equivalent) represents indebtedness outstanding under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility (excluding Facility AC, Facility AD and the Finco Loans), €1.1 billion (equivalent)
represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the UPCB Notes, €1.4 billion (equivalent calculated at the
Original Issue Date exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the euro of 1.0619) represents the aggregate principal amount
outstanding under the Original Notes and €302.6 million (equivalent calculated at the May 12, 2015 exchange rate between
U.S. dollars and the euro of 1.1237) represents the aggregate principal amount of the Additional Notes offered hereby.

From time to time, UPC Holding may raise additional indebtedness, including additional capital markets indebtedness,

to, inter alia, refinance tranches of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and extend maturities. UPC Holding will be
permitted to incur additional indebtedness in the future (including by way of one or more Potential Financing Transactions) to
the extent such indebtedness is incurred in compliance with certain covenants included in the indentures governing the
UPCH Notes and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. Based on UPC Holding’s covenant compliance calculations as of
December 31, 2014, and as adjusted for the Early 2015 Refinancings, the Transfers, the issuance of the Original Notes and the
funding of the Original Finco Loans and the application of the proceeds therefrom to complete the Refinancing, the May
Facility AI Additional Net Borrowings and the application of the proceeds therefrom to complete the May UPC Holding
Subordinated Shareholder Loan Partial Repayment, the May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance, and the
issuance of the Additional Notes offered hereby and the funding of the Additional Dollar Finco Loan and the application of the
proceeds therefrom, together with the proceeds from the May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance and
existing cash and cash equivalents of UPC Holding and its subsidiaries, to complete the May Facility AI Prepayment,
approximately €453.5 million was available for borrowing under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. See the
discussions under the heading “Description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility” and heading “Description of Other
_Indebtedness of UPC Holding” for further information about UPC Holding’s substantial debt. Furthermore, UPC Holding’s_
ability to incur additional indebtedness may increase to the extent the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments are
approved and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is so amended. See “Description of the Notes—Finco Accession
_Agreements and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”._

-----

Because the Issuer has no material operations and no material assets other than the Finco Loans, UPC Holding’s high

level of debt could have important consequences for you as a holder of the Notes including, but not limited to:

� making it more difficult for UPC Holding to satisfy its obligations under the Finco Loans, and in turn making it
more difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes;

� requiring UPC Holding to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to payments on its debt,
thereby reducing the funds available to it to finance its operations, capital expenditures, working capital, research
and development and other general corporate purposes, including maintaining the quality of its network and
product performance;

� placing UPC Holding at a competitive disadvantage compared to other broadband communications providers in
its key markets that have less debt than it does;

� limiting UPC Holding’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the competitive and
economic environment in which it operates; and

� impeding UPC Holding’s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, and increasing the cost of any such
borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on UPC Holding’s ability to satisfy

its debt obligations, including the Finco Loans, and in turn, the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.

In addition, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the indentures governing the UPCH Notes contain

financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit UPC Holding’s ability to engage in activities that may be in its long
term best interests, including, among other things, borrowing additional funds. These restrictions are subject to significant
exceptions. UPC Holding’s failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility and/or the UPCH Notes which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all UPC
Holding’s debts or have a similar material adverse effect on it.

UPC Holding may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in connection with any future acquisition.

In connection with its financial strategy, UPC Holding continually evaluates different financing alternatives, and it may decide
to enter into new credit facilities or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including during the period following the
consummation of this offering. If UPC Holding incurs new debt in addition to its current debt, the related risks that it now
faces, as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors”, could intensify.

**_UPC Holding’s substantial leverage could limit its ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects._**

UPC Holding seeks to maintain its debt at levels that provide for attractive returns without assuming undue risk. In

this regard, UPC Holding strives to cause its operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated
debt balance that is between four and five times UPC Holding’s consolidated operating cash flow (as defined in note 15 to the
December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum). At December 31, 2014, on an
as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Early 2015 Refinancings, the issuance of the Original Notes and the funding of the
Original Finco Loans and the application of the proceeds therefrom to complete the Refinancing, the May Facility AI
Additional Net Borrowings and the application of the proceeds therefrom to complete the May UPC Holding Subordinated
Shareholder Loan Partial Repayment, the May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance, and the issuance of the
Additional Notes offered hereby and the funding of the Additional Dollar Finco Loan and the application of the proceeds
therefrom, together with the proceeds from the May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loan Advance, to complete the
May Facility AI Prepayment, the carrying amount of UPC Holding’s total third-party consolidated outstanding debt and capital
lease obligations would have been approximately €5.6 billion, of which €362.3 million is due over the next 12 months. UPC
Holding believes that it has sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of its debt and capital lease
obligations and to fund its foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as UPC Holding’s debt
maturities grow in later years, it anticipates that it will seek to refinance or otherwise extend its debt maturities. No assurance
can be given that UPC Holding would be able to refinance or otherwise extend its debt maturities in light of current market
conditions. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns and/or any adverse
regulatory developments could impact the credit markets UPC Holding accesses and, accordingly, UPC Holding’s future
liquidity and financial position.

UPC Holding’s ability to service or refinance its debt and to maintain compliance with its leverage covenants in the

credit agreements and indentures of UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding is dependent primarily on its ability to
maintain or increase the operating cash flow of its operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on its property and

16


-----

equipment additions and acquisitions. Accordingly, if UPC Holding’s cash provided by operations declines or it encounters
other material liquidity requirements, UPC Holding may be required to seek additional debt financing in order to meet its debt
obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come due. In addition, UPC Holding’s ability to obtain additional debt
financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, or other general corporate requirements is limited
by the leverage covenants contained in its and UPC Broadband Holding’s debt instruments. For example, if the operating cash
flow of UPC Broadband Holding were to decline, UPC Holding could be required to partially repay or limit its borrowings
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to maintain compliance with applicable covenants. UPC Holding
can give no assurance that any additional debt financing will be available on terms that are as favorable as the terms of its
existing debt or at all. UPC Holding’s ability to access available borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
can also be impacted by the interplay of average and spot foreign currency rates with respect to leverage calculations under the
indentures governing the UPC Holding Senior Notes.

**_UPC Holding may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the_**
**_Additional Notes, which indebtedness could increase its leverage and interest expense and may have terms that are more or_**
**_less favorable than the terms of the Notes and UPC Holding’s other existing indebtedness._**

UPC Holding or its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including to refinance UPC Holding’s existing

indebtedness, to fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes, which may include loans, distributions or other
payments to UPC Holding and its direct or indirect parent companies. In connection with UPC Holding’s financial strategy,
UPC Holding continually evaluates different financing alternatives, and UPC Holding may decide to enter into new credit
facilities, access the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation
of this offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Additional Notes. Any such offering
or incurrence of debt will be made at UPC Holding’s election or the election of its relevant subsidiaries, and if such debt is in
the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering memorandum.
The interest rate with respect to any such additional indebtedness will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such
indebtedness and, to the extent the interest rate is greater than the interest rate applicable to any indebtedness that is refinanced,
or to the extent of any incremental indebtedness, such offering or incurrence would be expected to increase our cash interest
expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional indebtedness will be set at the time of
pricing of such incurrence or offering and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes. The other terms of such
additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the
terms of the Notes or UPC Holding’s other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that UPC Holding or its
subsidiaries will elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be
no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If UPC Holding
incurs new debt in addition to its current debt, the related risks that UPC Holding now faces, even in a refinancing transaction,
as described above and elsewhere in these “Risk Factors”, could intensify.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure**

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Dollar Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Dollar Notes_**

**_will be limited._**

The Issuer cannot assure you as to:

� the liquidity of any market in the Dollar Notes;

� your ability to sell your Dollar Notes; or

� the prices at which you would be able to sell your Dollar Notes.

Future trading prices of the Dollar Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing

interest rates, UPC Holding’s operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities
similar to the Dollar Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Dollar Notes may be adversely affected by a general
decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the
market for the Dollar Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder
of Dollar Notes, regardless of UPC Holding’s prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers of the Dollar Notes
have advised the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Dollar Notes. However, the Dollar Initial Purchasers
and the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers are not obliged to do so, and they may discontinue any market making activities at
any time without notice. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Dollar Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your Dollar Notes at a fair value, if at all.

17


-----

Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Dollar Notes listed and

admitted to the Official List and trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange within a reasonable
period after the Issue Date of the Notes and to maintain such listing as long as the Dollar Notes are outstanding, the Issuer
cannot assure you that the Dollar Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer can no longer maintain the listing on the
Irish Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing (for the avoidance of doubt, the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards or any accounting
standard other than U.S. GAAP and any other standard pursuant to which the Issuer prepares its financial statements shall be
deemed unduly burdensome), the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Irish Stock Exchange, provided that
it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Dollar Notes on another stock exchange although
there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Dollar
Notes as a result of listing on the Irish Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers in
accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Dollar Notes from the Irish Stock
Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability
to resell Dollar Notes in the secondary market.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds from the sale of the Additional Notes, together with the fees payable to the Issuer by UPC Financing

under the Additional Notes Fee Letter, as described below, are expected to be $340 million (€302.6 million equivalent) before
considering any applicable premiums (plus accrued interest from the Original Issue Date). The Issuer expects to use the net
proceeds of the issuance of the Additional Notes, together with the fees payable to it by UPC Financing under the Additional
Notes Fee Letter, as described below, to fund the Additional Dollar Finco Loan, including any premium, if applicable, payable
to UPC Financing under the accession agreement related to the Additional Dollar Finco Loan. The proceeds of the Additional
Dollar Finco Loan are intended to be used, together with the proceeds of the May UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder
Loan Advance and existing cash and cash equivalents of UPC Holding and its subsidiaries, to (i) fund the May Facility AI
Prepayment, (ii) pay certain fees and expenses payable to the Issuer under the Additional Notes Fee Letter and (iii) for general
corporate purposes, which may include loans, distributions or other payments to UPC Holding and its direct or indirect parent
companies. The Additional Notes Initial Purchasers’ commissions and certain estimated expenses incurred in connection with
this offering are expected to be approximately $3.8 million (€3.4 million equivalent), including legal, accounting and other
professional fees incurred in connection therewith. An amount equal to such commissions and expenses on the Additional
Notes will be paid by UPC Financing as part of the fees payable by UPC Financing to the Issuer under the Additional Notes
Fee Letter. Euro equivalent amounts presented above are calculated at the May 12, 2015 exchange rate between U.S. dollars
and the euro of 1.1237.

UPC Holding has consolidated the Issuer following the issuance of the Original Notes. Accordingly, the Additional

Dollar Finco Loan and UPC Financing’s payment of the upfront fee to the Issuer under the Additional Notes Fee Letter will be
eliminated in consolidation. For a description of the Additional Notes Fee Letter, which is substantially similar to the Original
Notes Fee Letter, see “Recent Developments of UPC Holding―The Refinancing and Other Transactions” and “Description of
_the Notes—Certain Transaction Documents”._

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Cayman Islands Taxation**

The following is a discussion of certain Cayman Islands tax consequences of an investment in the Additional Notes.

The discussion is a general summary of present law, which is subject to prospective and retroactive change. It is not intended
as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s particular circumstances, and does not consider tax consequences other than
those arising under Cayman Islands law.

Under existing Cayman Islands laws:

� Payments of interest and principal on the Additional Notes will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands
and no withholding will be required on the payment of interest and principal to any holder of the Additional
Notes, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the Additional Notes be subject to Cayman Islands income or
corporation tax. The Cayman Islands currently have no income, corporation or capital gains tax and no estate
duty, inheritance tax or gift tax.

� No stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of the Additional Notes. Ad valorem stamp duty will be payable,
however, within 45 days of an executed, completed and delivered original of the Additional Notes being brought
into the Cayman Islands, for example, for enforcement. An instrument of transfer in respect of a Additional Note
is stampable if executed in or brought into the Cayman Islands.

**The Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision)—Undertaking as to Tax Concessions**

The Issuer has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability

and, as such, has applied for and obtained an undertaking as to tax concessions from the Governor in Cabinet of the Cayman
Islands substantially in the following form:

In accordance with Section 6 of The Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) the Governor in Cabinet undertakes with

the Issuer:

(a) that no law which is hereafter enacted in the Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or
appreciations shall apply to the Issuer or its operations; and

(b) in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or
inheritance tax shall be payable

(i) on or in respect of the shares debentures or other obligations of the Issuer; or

(ii) by way of the withholding in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in Section 6(3) of the Tax
Concessions Law (1999 Revision).

These concessions shall be for a period of TWENTY years from the 8[th] day of February 2011.

**EU Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income**

Under the Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) each Member State of the EU (a

“Member State”) is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of interest payments or other
similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in that other
Member State. However, Austria may instead apply a withholding system for a transitional period in relation to such payments,
deducting tax at a current rate of 35%. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following
agreement by certain non-EU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the EU adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope of the

requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from January 1, 2017. The
changes will expand the range of payments covered by the EU Savings Tax Directive, in particular to include additional types
of income payable on securities. The directive will also expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an
individual resident in a Member State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons,
entities or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the
person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the EU.

23


-----

A number of non-EU countries and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States have adopted

similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a person within
its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in a Member State. In addition, the Member States
have entered into reciprocal provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent
or associated territories in relation to payments made by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a person for, an
individual resident in one of those territories.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition, ownership,

and disposition of the Additional Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This description only applies to Additional Notes
held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and does not address, except as set forth below, aspects of U.S.
federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as:

� banks or other financial institutions;

� insurance companies;

� real estate investment trusts, individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts;

� regulated investment companies;

� grantor trusts;

� tax-exempt organizations;

� persons that will own the Additional Notes through partnerships or other pass-through entities;

� dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

� U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

� certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United States;

� U.S. Holders that use a mark-to-market method of accounting; or

� U.S. Holders that will hold an Additional Note as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging,
conversion or integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Moreover, this description does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or alternative minimum tax

consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Additional Notes and does not address the 3.8% Medicare
tax on net investment income that can also apply to certain U.S. holders’ capital gains and interest in respect of the Additional
Notes. This description also does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the
Additional Notes as part of the initial distribution under the terms of this offering and at the price on the cover hereto. These
Additional Notes will form part of the same issue of debt instruments as the Original Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Each prospective purchaser should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and nonU.S. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Additional Notes.

This description is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) (“Code”), U.S. Treasury

Regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, each
as available and in effect on the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly
with retroactive effect), which could affect the tax considerations described herein. No opinion of counsel or ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be given with respect to any of the considerations discussed herein. No
assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position different from any of the tax
considerations discussed below.

For purposes of this description, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Additional Notes who for U.S. federal

income tax purposes is:

� a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

24


-----

� a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized in or
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, including the District of Columbia;

� an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

� a trust (1) that validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (2)(a) the
administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the substantial decisions of
which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Additional Notes,

the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Such partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to its consequences.

The discussion below assumes that the Additional Notes are treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax

purposes, except as otherwise described.

Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of Additional Notes should consult their own tax advisors

concerning the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to their particular situations as well as any considerations arising
under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**_Characterization of the Issuer_**

The Issuer will file IRS Form 8832, electing to be treated as an entity disregarded from its sole owner for U.S. federal

income tax purposes, to be effective on or prior to the issuance of the Additional Notes.

**_Redemptions and Additional Amounts_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase”, “Description of the Notes—

_Withholding Taxes”, and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Payments for Consent”), the Issuer may be_
obligated to make payments in excess of stated interest and the adjusted issue price of the Additional Notes (“Additional
**Amounts”) or redeem the Additional Notes in advance of their expected maturity. The Issuer believes that the Additional**
Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of the possibility of such payments or redemptions.
This position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance of the Additional Notes, of
such payments or redemptions. Assuming such position is respected, any amounts paid to a U.S. Holder pursuant to such
redemption would be taxable as described below in “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Taxable Disposition” and any payments
of Additional Amounts should be taxable as additional ordinary income when received or accrued, in accordance with such
holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS, however, may take a position contrary to the
position described above, which could affect the amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the
Additional Notes. A U.S. Holder that desires to take the position that the Additional Notes are subject to the contingent
payment debt instrument rules should consult with its tax advisor, including regarding the manner in which to disclose such
position as required by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations; the IRS may disagree with such holder’s contrary position. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Additional Notes of the contingent payment
debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof. This discussion assumes that the Additional Notes are not treated as
contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest_**

A portion of the purchase price of the Additional Notes will be attributable to the amount of unpaid stated interest

accrued prior to the date the Additional Notes are purchased (“pre-issuance accrued interest”). The portion of the first stated
interest payment that represents pre-issuance accrued interest should be treated as a non-taxable return of the pre-issuance
accrued interest and should reduce a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in an Additional Note. Prospective purchasers of the Additional
Notes are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding pre-issuance accrued interest.

**_Payments and Accruals of Stated Interest_**

Except as discussed above with respect to pre-issuance accrued interest, stated interest paid on the Additional Notes

generally will be treated as “qualified stated interest.” Payments of qualified stated interest on the Additional Notes (including
any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be
taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally

25


-----

means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is
treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate.

Interest included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with respect to the Additional Notes will be treated as foreign

source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is
calculated separately with respect to specific “baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute
“passive category income”, or in the case of certain U.S. Holders, “general category income”. Any non-U.S. withholding tax
paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of
such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Bond Premium_**

If a U.S. Holder purchases Additional Notes for an amount (excluding any portion thereof allocable to pre-issuance

accrued interest) greater than the sum of all amounts (other than qualified stated interest) payable with respect to the Additional
Notes after the date of acquisition, the U.S. Holder is treated as having purchased the related Additional Notes with
amortizable “bond premium.” A U.S. Holder may elect to amortize the premium from the purchase date to the maturity date of
the Additional Notes (or, if it results in a smaller premium, attributable to the period before an earlier call date, an amount
determined with reference to the amount payable on the earlier call date with respect to such period) under a constant yield
method.

Amortizable premium generally may be deducted against interest income on such Additional Notes and generally may

not be deducted against other income. A U.S. Holder’s basis in an Additional Note will be reduced by any premium
amortization deductions. An election to amortize premium on a constant yield method, once made, generally applies to all debt
obligations held or subsequently acquired by such U.S. Holder during the taxable year of the election and thereafter, and may
not be revoked without IRS consent.

With respect to a U.S. Holder that does not elect to amortize bond premium, the amount of bond premium will reduce

a gain or increase a loss upon sale, exchange or other disposition or result in a loss when the bond matures.

The bond premium rules are complicated, and U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the

tax consequences of owning and disposing of Additional Notes with bond premium, including the availability of certain
elections.

**_Possible Effects of the UPC Exchange Transaction_**

In connection with the UPC Exchange Transaction, holders that elect to participate in the exchange will receive UPC

Qualified Notes with a new issuer. This change may be viewed as giving rise to a significant modification of the Additional
Notes, though there may be arguments to the contrary. If the change in issuer is treated as a significant modification, U.S.
Holders will recognize gain or loss as described under “Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition.” The
amount deemed to be realized in such a taxable exchange would be the issue price of the UPC Qualified Notes, which would
be the fair market value of the UPC Qualified Notes as of the date of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, the UPC
Qualified Notes are treated as publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, a U.S. Holder could be treated
as acquiring the UPC Qualified Notes with original issue discount (“OID”). This would occur if the issue price of the UPC
Qualified Notes as of the date of the deemed exchange (based on the fair market value of the UPC Qualified Notes if the UPC
Qualified Notes are treated as publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes) was less than the stated principal amount
of the UPC Qualified Notes by at least the OID de minimis amount (as described above). If the UPC Qualified Notes are issued
with OID, a U.S. Holder may be required to include such excess in income as OID, as it accrues, in accordance with a constant
yield method based on a compounding of interest before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Except as noted above in this paragraph, the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to
owning a UPC Qualified Note should generally be the same as the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to owning an
Additional Note.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an

Additional Note equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition (other than any amount received in respect of accrued and unpaid interest (other than pre-issuance accrued interest)
which will be subject to tax in the manner described above in “—Payments and Accruals of Stated Interest” to the extent not
previously included in income), and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Additional Note.

26


-----

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost decreased by payments

other than stated interest (excluding any amount attributable to pre-issuance accrued interest) made with respect to the Note
and the amount of amortized premium, if any.

Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note will

be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Additional Note has been held for more than one year.
Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to
offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of an Additional Note generally will be treated as gain or loss from sources within the United States.

**_Subsequent Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue “Subsequent Additional Notes”. These Subsequent Additional Notes, even if they are treated

for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes, in some cases may not be fungible for U.S. federal income
tax purposes with the original Notes.

**_Alternative Characterization of the Additional Notes_**

The proper characterization of instruments such as the Additional Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes is

uncertain. It is possible that the Additional Notes may not be treated as indebtedness of the Issuer, but even if an alternative
characterization were to apply, a U.S. Holder should, in general, be taxed in a manner similar to that described above with
respect to such holder’s share of interest and any disposition of the Notes. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors
in this regard.

**_U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting_**

Backup withholding and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments of principal of, and

interest on, an obligation and to proceeds of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an obligation, to
certain U.S. Holders. The payor will be required to withhold backup withholding tax on payments made within the United
States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman or certain of their affiliates, on an Additional Note to, or from gross proceeds of
the sale or disposition of an Additional Note paid to, a U.S. Holder if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer
identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or establish an exemption from, the backup withholding requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a

holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information in a timely
manner.

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Additional Notes, subject to

certain exceptions (including an exception for notes held in custodial accounts maintained by certain financial institutions).
U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and
disposition of the Additional Notes.

**_FATCA_**

Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued thereunder (“FATCA”) generally

may impose withholding at a rate of 30% on payments made to any foreign entity on debt obligations generating U.S. source
interest or certain other debt obligations generating non-U.S. source interest issued by a foreign financial institution that
(i) enters into certain agreements with the IRS or (ii) becomes subject to provisions of local law intended to implement an
intergovernmental agreement entered into pursuant to FATCA, in each case to the extent such payments are attributable to U.S.
source income, unless the foreign entity receiving such payments complies with various U.S. information reporting and/or due
diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with such foreign entity) or
otherwise qualifies for an exemption. Withholding on payments on debt obligations issued by foreign financial institutions,
including on debt obligations generating non-U.S. source interest, will not occur before 2017. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
even if payments on the Additional Notes are treated as or are paid from a foreign financial institution, including in the event
the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, and such payments are treated as “foreign passthru payments,” the
Additional Notes will be grandfathered because no final regulations defining a “foreign passthru payment” have been issued
and therefore are not subject to the FATCA rules (including the withholding rules) described above. If, however, the
Additional Notes are modified at a time when the grandfathering rules are no longer available (i.e., more than six months after
the date final regulations define a “foreign passthru payment”), withholding can apply and holders and beneficial owners of the

27


-----

Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive any additional amounts to compensate them for such withholding. In addition,
if Subsequent Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period, have the same CUSIP or ISIN as
the Additional Notes issued hereby, and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all notes,
including the Additional Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. The intergovernmental agreement
between the Cayman Islands and the United States (see below) modifies the requirements in this paragraph and an
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign country where a holder or intermediary is located may
further modify such requirements. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this
legislation on their investment in the Notes.

**The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to the**

**acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Additional** **Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Additional** **Notes should**
**consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations.**

**Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority Law**

The Cayman Islands have entered into a Model 1 intergovernmental agreement (the “US IGA”) with the United

States and have entered into a similar intergovernmental agreement (the “UK IGA”) with the United Kingdom (together with
the US IGA, the “IGAs”). The Issuer will be required to comply with the Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority Law
(2014 Revision)(as amended) together with regulations and guidance notes made pursuant to such Law that give effect to the
IGAs. To the extent the Issuer is classified as a Cayman Islands Financial Institution and cannot be treated as a Non-Reporting
Cayman Islands Financial Institution (as defined in the IGAs) by taking advantage of one of the categories set out in Annex II
to the IGAs (for example by being a Sponsored Investment Entity (as defined in the IGAs)), the Issuer will be a “Reporting
**Cayman Islands Financial Institution” (as defined in the IGAs). Although the FATCA classification of the Issuer is not**
entirely clear, the Issuer has registered with the IRS and obtained a Global Intermediary Identification Number (for the
purposes of the US IGA only) and intends to report to the Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority any payments made to
(i) Specified US Persons with respect to US Reportable Accounts and (ii) Specified UK Persons with respect to UK Reportable
Accounts (each such term as defined in the relevant IGA). The Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority will exchange such
information with the IRS or HMRC as the case may be under the terms of the relevant IGA. Under the terms of the US IGA,
withholding will not be imposed on payments made to the Issuer unless the IRS has specifically listed the Issuer as a nonparticipating financial institution, or on payments made by the Issuer to the holders of Additional Notes unless the Issuer has
otherwise assumed responsibility for withholding under United States tax law.

28

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers, and the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers

have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Additional Notes. The Additional Notes will
initially be sold to the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers pursuant to a purchase agreement to be entered into on or about the
date hereof on terms substantially identical to those described in connection with the offering of the Original Dollar Notes in
the section entitled “Plan of Distribution” in the Original Offering Memorandum.

The obligations of the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement entered into on or about the

date hereof, including their agreement to purchase Additional Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. Pursuant to the
terms of this purchase agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Additional Notes Initial Purchaser, and each Additional
Notes Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, together with all other Additional
Notes Initial Purchasers, Additional Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $340 million.

The Additional Notes Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer each of the Additional Notes for resale at the issue

price that appears on the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers
may change the offering price and any other selling terms. The Additional Notes Initial Purchasers may offer and sell
Additional Notes through certain of their affiliates.

In the purchase agreement entered into on or about the date hereof, the Issuer, UPC Holding and UPC Broadband

Holding have agreed that:

      - subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to (i) one or more additional facilities or debt
securities, the proceeds of which are used to fund one or more additional facilities, under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility, (ii) the issuance of any debt securities by UPC Holding or (iii) any further
issuance of additional notes (as the term is defined in the Indenture), the Issuer, UPC Holding and UPC
Broadband Holding will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly,
or file with the Securities Exchange Commission a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act
relating to any debt securities, which are substantially similar to the Additional Notes offered hereby, issued
by the Issuer, having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue of the Additional Notes, without
the prior consent of Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, for a period of 30 days after the Time of Sale
(as defined in the purchase agreement entered into on or about the date hereof); and

      - the Issuer, UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding will indemnify the Additional Notes Initial
Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to
payments that the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Certain of the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC, and therefore may

not make sales of any Additional Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws
and regulations. To the extent that any such Additional Notes Initial Purchaser intends to effect sales of the Additional Notes in
the United States, it will do so only through one or more affiliated U.S. registered broker dealers, or otherwise as permitted by
applicable U.S. law.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_United States_**

Each purchaser of Additional Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will be deemed to

have made the acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under the section entitled “Transfer
_Restrictions” in the Supplement._

This Offering Memorandum is directed solely at persons who (i) are outside the United Kingdom or (ii) have

professional experience in matters relating to investments or (iii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (all such persons together being referred to as
“relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons.
Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and
will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**_European Economic Area_**

In relation to each member state of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a “Relevant

Member State”), each Additional Notes Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the
date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the “Relevant Implementation Date”),
it has not made and will not make an offer of Additional Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this

**_The Netherlands_**

Each Additional Notes Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Additional Notes (including rights

representing an interest in each global note that represents the Additional Notes) may only be offered or sold to qualified
investors (gekwalificeerde beleggers) as defined in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht).

**_Cayman Islands_**

No invitation whether directly or indirectly may be made to the public in the Cayman Islands to subscribe for the

Additional Notes unless the Issuer is listed on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange. The Issuer does not intend to be so listed.

**General**

The Additional Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the

Additional Notes. In addition, the Additional Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under
the section entitled “Transfer Restrictions” in the Supplement. The Issuer will apply to list the Additional Notes on the Official
List of the Irish Stock Exchange and for the admission for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. The Additional
Notes Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer and UPC Holding that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes,
but they are not obligated to do so. The Additional Notes Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the
Additional Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits
imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer and UPC Holding cannot assure you
that a liquid trading market will develop for the Additional Notes, that you will be able to sell your Additional Notes at a
particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other

charges in connection with purchases of securities.

We expect that delivery of the Additional Notes will be made against payment on the Additional Notes on or about

the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used

for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally

are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the business day will be

required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the offering of the Additional Notes, the Stabilizing Managers may engage in overallotment,

stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which
creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Additional Notes in the open market for
the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Additional Notes. Syndicate covering transactions typically
involve purchases of the Additional Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short
positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Additional Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Managers engage in stabilizing or
syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The Additional Notes Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in

various activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Additional Notes
Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various
consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending and capital markets services for UPC Holding and
Liberty Global, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Additional Notes Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to subsidiaries of Liberty Global or UPC Holding in the
past. Certain of the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with, and/or own
outstanding debt securities of, UPC Holding and/or its affiliates have hedged, and are likely to hedge in the future, their credit
exposure to UPC Holding and/or its affiliates consistent with their risk management policies. Typically, the Additional Notes
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Additional Notes.
Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Additional Notes. In
addition, certain of the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers or their affiliates provide UPC Holding and/or its affiliates, from
time to time, with hedging services, and may act as counterparties to certain hedging agreements entered into by UPC Holding
and/or its affiliates and such parties will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities.

31


-----

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers and their respective

affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and
such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer. The Additional Notes Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent
research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire,
long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Certain of the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under facilities of the

UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility certain of which will be repaid with the proceeds from the offering of the Additional
Notes and are parties to certain hedging arrangements with UPC Holding and/or its subsidiaries. See “Use of Proceeds”. In
addition, certain of the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are party to certain hedging
arrangements and may be counterparties to certain cross-currency swap contracts that we may enter into with respect to the
Additional Notes.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Additional Notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the

U.S. Securities Act (the “Rule 144A Notes”). The Additional Notes also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act (the “Regulation S Notes’’). Except as set forth below, the Additional
Notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. Additional Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available
funds.

The Rule 144A Notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest

coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes’’). Regulation S Notes initially will be represented by one or
more temporary global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Temporary
**Global Notes’’) and will have different international securities identification numbers and CUSIP from, and will not trade**
fungibly, with the Original Dollar Notes through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this
offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “Restricted Period’’). The Rule
144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with The Bank of New
York Mellon as custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC’’), in New York, New York, and registered in the name
of DTC or its nominee, in each case, for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC, as described below.
Through and including the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held
only through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear system (“Euroclear’’), and Clearstream Banking, S.A.
(“Clearstream’’) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A
Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. Within a reasonable time period after the
expiration of the Restricted Period, the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent
global notes in registered form without interest coupons (collectively, the “Regulation S Permanent Global Notes’’ and,
together with the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes’’; the Regulation S Global Notes
and the Rule 144A Global Notes collectively being the “Global Notes’’) as provided in the Indenture and pursuant to
Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for
beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—
_Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes.’’_

Except as set forth below, the Global Notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to another nominee of

DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee. Beneficial interests in the Global Notes may not be exchanged for definitive
registered Dollar Notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes’’) except in the limited circumstances described
below under “—Issuance of Defitive Registered Notes”. Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of
beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Dollar Notes in certificated form.

Rule 144A Notes (including beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes) will be subject to certain restrictions

on transfer and will bear a restrictive legend as described under “Transfer Restrictions.’’ In addition, transfers of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants
(including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have Dollar Notes registered in their

names, will not receive physical delivery of Dollar Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners
or “holders’’ thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

Payments on Global Notes

Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of

DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the
Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names the Dollar Notes, including the Global Notes, are
registered as the owners of the Dollar Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
neither we, the Trustee nor any of our or its respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

� any aspect or the accuracy of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s (in each case, as defined
below under “—Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream”) records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial
ownership interests in the Global Notes; or

37


-----

� any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities, such as the Dollar

Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment
date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is
credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security
as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Dollar
Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the
Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or us. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for
any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the Dollar Notes,
and we and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for
all purposes.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will

be paid to holders of interests in such Dollar Notes in U.S. dollars.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the

applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither we nor the Trustee nor the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers nor any
of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs,
losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such
payment.

**Action by Owners of Beneficial Interests in the Global Notes**

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Dollar Notes only at the direction

of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given
such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Dollar Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its Participants.

**Transfers**

The Dollar Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange’s Global

Exchange Market. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,’’ transfers between the Participants
will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures,
which rules and operating procedures may change from time to time.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will receive Definitive Registered

Notes:

� if DTC notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes and, in
either case, a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days after the date of such notice;

� if the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to exchange in whole, but not in part, the
Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes;

� in whole, but not in part, if the Issuer or DTC so request following an event of default; or

� if the holder of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC or to the Issuer
following an event of default.

In all cases, the Issuer shall issue or cause to be issued Definitive Registered Notes in such name or names and issued

in any approved denominations, as DTC shall instruct the Issuer based on the instructions received by DTC from the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests.

38


-----

Definitive Registered Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor

first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Dollar Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.’’

**Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Rule 144A Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged

for beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note only if:

� such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the Dollar Notes pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act; and

� the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect
that the Dollar Notes are being transferred to a person: (a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified
institutional buyer (“QIB”) within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act; (b) purchasing for its
own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act; and (c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and
other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an

interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period, only if the transferor
first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities
Act (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest transferred will be
held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A

Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system.
Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or
vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become
an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures
applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices
of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Restricted
Period.

**Same Day Settlement**

We will make payments in respect of the Dollar Notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium,

if any, and interest) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its nominee. We will
make all payments of principal, interest and premium, if any, with respect to Definitive Registered Notes by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders of the Definitive Registered Notes or, at the option of the
Issuer, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The Dollar Notes represented by the Global Notes are
expected to be eligible to trade in The PORTAL[SM] Market and to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any
permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately
available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any Definitive Registered Notes will also be settled in immediately
available funds.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Dollar Notes described herein and under

“Transfer Restrictions” and the other requirements of the Indenture, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one
hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s
rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market
transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such
system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system.
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to
its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement
applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories
for Euroclear or Clearstream.

39


-----

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an

interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear
or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and
Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales
of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value
on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the
business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests

in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream,
they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue or modify such
procedures at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the principal paying agent nor any of our or their respective agents will have
any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as

a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and
are subject to changes by them. Neither we nor the Additional Notes Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these
operations and procedures and we urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating

organizations (collectively, the “Participants’’) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities
between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants, thereby eliminating the need for
physical movement of securities certificates. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the Additional
Notes Initial Purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s
system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants’’). Persons who
are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect
Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are
recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures
established by it:

� upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the Additional
Notes Initial Purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

� ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests
will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants
and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes).

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC.

Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through
organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must
initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly
through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also
hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream.
Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. All interests in a Global
Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC.
Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems.
The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because
DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a person
having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such
interests.

AL Commitments denominated in US dollars, to be drawn in US dollars, with the
same Final Maturity Date and Margin as specified in the Additional Facility AL
Accession Agreement; and (ii) unless otherwise specified, references to Facility AL
Advances under the Additional Facility AL Accession Agreement shall include the
Facility AL2 Advance and any other Advance made under any further Additional
Facility AL Accession Agreement described in clause (b)(i) of this paragraph 8.

(c) Where any Facility AL Advance has not already been consolidated with any other
Facility AL Advance, on the last day of any Interest Period for such Facility AL
Advance, that Facility AL Advance will be consolidated with any other Facility AL
Advance which has an Interest Period ending on the same day as that Facility AL
Advance, and all such Facility AL Advances will then be treated as one Advance.

9. Facility AL2 may be drawn by one Advance on the date of this Agreement and such date will
constitute the Availability Period for Facility AL2. No more than one Request may be made
in respect of Facility AL2 under the Credit Agreement and such Request may only be in a
principal amount of the Additional Facility Commitment in relation to Facility AL2 as set out
in Clause 6 above, provided that the Facility AL2 Advance will be funded with a premium of
$[�] payable by the Additional Facility AL2 Lender for the benefit of the Borrower.

10. The Facility AL2 Advance will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital
purposes, including the repayment or prepayment of existing indebtedness.

11. The Final Maturity Date in respect of Facility AL2 is 15 January, 2025. Any outstanding
Advance under Facility AL2 shall be repaid in full on the Final Maturity Date.

12. The interest rate for Facility AL2 will be a fixed rate of 5.375 per cent. per annum and interest
shall accrue from the date of the initial funding of Facility AL. This will be calculated in
accordance with Clause 8.1 (Interest rate) of the Credit Agreement as being the sum of
LIBOR, the applicable Margin and the Mandatory Costs (if applicable), where, in order to
achieve the fixed rate referred to above, the applicable Margin will be, with respect to any
Interest Period:

(a) 5.375 per cent. per annum, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months;

minus

(b) the sum of LIBOR plus the Mandatory Costs (if applicable) for such Interest Period.

For the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of this calculation, the applicable Margin may be
a negative number. Further, the interest rate for Facility AL2 will never exceed 5.375 per
cent. per annum (save to the extent that Clause 8.8 (Default interest) may apply).

13. Pursuant to Clause 8.2 (Selection of Interest Periods) of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower
hereby notifies the Facility Agent that while the Facility AL2 Advance is outstanding it
selects six months for all Interest Periods in relation to that Advance.

14. Upon the delivery by the Facility Agent of a notice of cancellation of Facility AL2 pursuant to
Clause 7.4(a)(v)(B) (Change of Control) of the Credit Agreement following the occurrence of
a Change of Control (as defined under Clause 7.4 (Change of Control) of the Credit
Agreement), UPC Broadband shall make a payment to the Facility Agent (for the account of
the Additional Facility AL2 Lender) in an amount equal to 1 per cent. of the principal amount
of the outstanding Facility AL2 Advance. Such payment shall be due and payable by UPC

Broadband to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL2 Lender) on
the actual date of such mandatory prepayment.

pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of the Credit Agreement in an amount not to
exceed 10% of the original principal amount of the Facility AL2 Advance during each twelvemonth period commencing on the date of this Agreement, UPC Broadband shall make a
payment to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL2 Lender) in an
amount (the Prepayment Premium) equal to 3% of the principal amount of the Facility AL2
Advance being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest then due on the amount of the
Facility AL2 Advance prepaid to the due date of prepayment. Such payment shall be due and
payable by UPC Broadband to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility
AL2 Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment. Prior to 15 January, 2020, to the extent
that during any twelve-month period commencing on the date of this Agreement, the principal
amount of the Facility AL2 Advance prepaid in any one or more voluntary prepayments is
greater than an amount equal to 10% of the original principal amount of the Facility AL2
Advance (any such amount, the Excess Early Redemption Proceeds), UPC Broadband will
apply the Excess Early Redemption Proceeds to a voluntary prepayment of the Facility AL2
Advance as described in Clause 16 below.

16.    (a) Subject to Clause 18 of this Agreement, at any time prior to 15 January, 2020, upon
the occurrence of a voluntary prepayment of all or any part of the outstanding Facility
AL2 Advance by UPC Broadband pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of
the Credit Agreement with any Excess Early Redemption Proceeds, UPC Broadband
shall make a payment to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility
AL2 Lender) in an amount equal to the Make-Whole Amount (as defined below)
(calculated as of a date no more than three Business Days prior to the date of the
relevant Cancellation Notice) as of the due date of such prepayment. Such payment
shall be due and payable by UPC Broadband to the Facility Agent (for the account of
the Additional Facility AL2 Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment.

For the purposes of this Clause 16:

**Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to Facility AL2 on any date on which all**
or any part of the outstanding Facility AL2 Advance is to be prepaid pursuant to
Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of the Credit Agreement (to the extent of any
Excess Early Redemption Proceeds), the excess of:

(i) the present value at such prepayment date of (i) the total amount that would
be payable to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility
AL2 Lender) if all or such portion of the outstanding Facility AL2 Advance
were prepaid pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of the Credit
Agreement on 15 January, 2020 (including the outstanding principal amount
of such Advance and the Additional Amount (as defined below) required
under this Clause 16, but excluding accrued interest and any other amounts
payable under the Credit Agreement in connection with such prepayment)
plus (ii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due in respect of
all or such portion of the outstanding Facility AL2 Advance through 15
January, 2020 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to the prepayment date),
computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below)
as of such prepayment date plus 50 basis points; over

(ii) the principal amount of the outstanding Facility AL2 Advance being prepaid.

**Treasury Rate means, as of any prepayment date, the yield to maturity at the time of**
computation of U.S. Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and
published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) which has
become publicly available at least two Business Days (but not more than five
Business Days) prior to the date of the relevant Cancellation Notice (or, if such
statistical release is not so published or available, any publicly available source of
similar market date selected by the Issuer in good faith)) most nearly equal to the
period from the prepayment date to 15 January, 2020; provided, however, that if the
period from the prepayment date to 15 January, 2020 is not equal to the constant
maturity of a U.S. Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the
Treasury Rate shall be obtained by a linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest
one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of U.S. Treasury securities for
which such yields are given, except that if the period from the prepayment date to 15
January, 2020 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded U.S.
Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

Such Payment of the Make-Whole Amount shall be due and payable by UPC
Broadband to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL2
Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment.

(b) Subject to Clause 18 of this Agreement, on or after 15 January, 2020, upon the
occurrence of a voluntary prepayment of all or any part of the outstanding Facility
AL2 Advance by UPC Broadband pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of
the Credit Agreement, UPC Broadband shall pay to the Facility Agent (for the
account of the Additional Facility AL2 Lender) an amount (the Additional Amount)
equal to the relevant percentage set out in the table below of the principal amount of
the Facility AL2 Advance being prepaid on the due date of such prepayment, if
prepaid during the twelve month period beginning on 15 January of the years

Such Payment of the Additional Amount shall be due and payable by UPC
Broadband to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL2
Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment.

17. Subject to Clause 18 of this Agreement, at any time prior to 15 January, 2018 upon the
occurrence of any voluntary prepayment of the Facility AL2 Advance by UPC Broadband
pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of the Credit Agreement with the Net Cash
Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (the **Equity Offering Early Redemption**
**Proceeds) in an amount not to exceed 40% of the original principal amount of the Facility**
AL2 Advance, UPC Broadband shall make a payment to the Facility Agent (for the account
of the Additional Facility AL2 Lender) in an amount (the **Equity Claw Prepayment**
**Premium) equal to 5.375 per cent. of the principal amount of the Facility AL2 Advance**
being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest then due on the amount of the Facility AL2

or on behalf of the signatory that the signatory authorises the attachment of such counterpart
signature page to the final text of this Agreement, such counterpart signature page shall take
effect together with such final text as a complete authoritative counterpart.

the Credit Agreement, UPC Broadband hereby consents to any assignment, transfer or

the Borrower to be exempt from withholding or deduction for any taxes under any applicable
international treaty and in connection with FATCA and any applicable reporting requirements
under FATCA in each case, in accordance with recent Liberty precedent. The Borrower will
not be liable under any tax gross up or tax indemnity provisions in respect of any FATCA
deductions other than in respect of any payments due to an SPV lender that has issued notes
and advanced the proceeds of such notes to a member of the Borrower Group under an
Additional Facility (provided that no gross up or indemnity shall be required for a FATCA
deduction where such FATCA deduction arises from any non-compliance by a holder of such
notes). Each Finance Party will be obliged to act reasonably and in good faith in making any
determination for the purpose of Clause 10 (Tax Gross-Up and Indemnities).

24. **VAT: amend Clause 10.6 (Value Added Tax) to (i) provide that no Party shall exercise any**

precedent), asset securitisation subsidiaries (as defined in accordance with recent Liberty
precedent) and entities that become subsidiaries as a result of an asset passthrough (as defined
in accordance with recent Liberty precedent).

27. **Permitted Affiliate Parent: amend the Credit Agreement in line with recent Liberty**
precedent to provide an ability to acquire Affiliates that are not Subsidiaries of UPC
Broadband but are Subsidiaries of another Affiliate common holding company that is not a
member of the Borrower Group (the holding entity of the acquired group being the
“Permitted Affiliate Parent”) and to allow conforming changes including the ability to
designate (subject to certain deliverables in accordance with recent Liberty precedent) any
new holding company as the common holding company of the Borrower Group for the
purposes of, amongst other things, the definitions of Change of Control, Restricted Payments
and Permitted Payments, in each case, in accordance with recent Liberty precedent and for the
purpose of reflecting a similar structure which supports the concept of a Permitted Affiliate
Parent as set out in recent Liberty precedent. Provide an ability for UPC Broadband to deliver
financial statements that are consolidated at the level of the common holding company
provided that UPC Broadband also delivers a Borrower Group reconciliation in accordance
with recent Liberty precedent, introducing the concept of a Reporting Entity.

incorporated company which is a member of the Borrower Group) may issue notes and incur
additional term or revolving debt or operational expenditure facilities which rank pari passu
with the rights of the Lenders and shall be capable of being secured by the transaction security
and provided that the proceeds of such debt may be used to, amongst other things, refinance
the Additional Facilities and for general working capital or operational purposes provided that
(other than in the case of a refinancing of other secured Financial Indebtedness in the same or
a lesser principal amount) such Financial Indebtedness is Permitted Financial Indebtedness.

thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify such Permitted Payment (or
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with the covenant in that Clause; and

(c) amend Clause 16.13 (Restricted Payment) to exclude Permitted Affiliate Transactions

forma basis would not be greater than 4.50:1.00 and provided that such Financial
Indebtedness is subject to an intercreditor agreement on terms satisfactory to the
Facility Agent (acting reasonably) and where (in the case of such Financial
Indebtedness being secured on a junior-ranking basis) the rights of the holders of such
Financial Indebtedness in respect of any payment will be contractually subordinated
to the rights of the Lenders on terms comparable to the Loan Market Association’s
form of intercreditor agreement at such time for mezzanine debt, as referred to in
recent Liberty precedent);

33

49480224_5


-----

(b) in Paragraph (n) of the definition of Permitted Security Interest, provide that the
Borrower may secure Financial Indebtedness under this general basket of up to the
greater of €250,000,000 and 5% of total assets, such security to be either on assets not
subject to the security in favour of the Lenders or otherwise secured on a junior
ranking basis over assets subject to the Lenders’ security (in the latter case provided
that the rights of the holders of such Financial Indebtedness in respect of any payment
will be contractually subordinated to the rights of the Lenders on terms comparable to
the Loan Market Association’s form of intercreditor agreement at such time for
mezzanine debt, as referred to in recent Liberty precedent); and

replace them with €75,000,000.

56. **Security and Guarantee Release: amend the relevant provisions of the Credit Agreement (in**
particular Clauses 26.4 (Additional Obligors), and 16.23 (Share Security)) to provide that,
subject to certain thresholds being met no Obligor nor any other member of the Borrower
Group is required to provide any Security or guarantee other than (i) Security over the shares
that it holds in any Obligor, (ii) Security required under the terms of the Credit Agreement in
respect of Subordinated Shareholder Loans, (iii) Security over loans made by Obligors to
other members of the Borrower Group in accordance with clause 16.14 (Loans and
_guarantees) and (iv) a guarantee from the Obligors under the terms of the Credit Agreement_
and include a provision to authorise the Security Agent to release any other Security or
guarantees other than the aforementioned and to release Security and guarantees in respect of
Permitted Disposals and to permit relevant Security to be released if a Guarantor resigns and
that guarantors can resign provided that the guarantor coverage test would still be met
notwithstanding such release.

57. **Events of Default:**

(a) amend Clause 1.2 (Construction) to clarify that both a Default and an Event of
Default is not continuing if remedied or waived;

principal and a 5 Business Day grace period for any other payments;

commencing negotiations with the Finance Parties will not constitute an Event of
Default under this Paragraph and amend Paragraph (a) of Clause 18.7 (Insolvency
_Proceedings) including a general exclusion for contested proceedings that are_
frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court but without the
requirement to provide a legal opinion with respect thereto to the Facility Agent;

(d) amend Clause 18.5 (Cross default) to carve out circumstances being contested in
good faith, Financial Indebtedness relating to hedging permitted under the Credit
Agreement where a termination event arises as a result of a financing and Financial
Indebtedness that is cash collateralised and such cash is available for application in
satisfaction of this indebtedness in each case in line with recent Liberty precedent;
and

(e) delete Clause 18.14 (Seizure), Clause 18.15 (Environmental Matters) 18.17 (Material

-----

58. **Impaired Agent: amend the Credit Agreement to provide for impaired agent provisions**
language used in recent Liberty precedent and/or, to the extent not inconsistent with recent
Liberty precedent, the European leverage loan market so that alternative payment and notice
arrangements are permitted if the Facility Agent is impaired.

59. **Defaulting Lender: include standard defaulting lender provisions used in recent Liberty**
precedent and/or, to the extent not inconsistent with recent Liberty precedent, the European
leverage loan market so as the commitments of a defaulting lender may be cancelled and it
will have no rights to vote in respect of such cancelled commitments. Clarify that no
commitment fee will be payable to a defaulting lender.

60. **Replacement of Agent/Security Agent:** amend Clause 19.14 (Resignation of Agents), in
accordance with recent Liberty precedent, to:

(a) remove the requirements for UPC Broadband to: (a) be unsatisfied with the
performance of the Agent; (b) specify reasonable grounds for replacement in the
relevant notice and (c) add a requirement that no Default is outstanding at the relevant
time;

(b) provide that UPC Broadband may remove the Facility Agent if the status or identity
of the Facility Agent causes any Obligor to become liable for any withholding tax in
connection with FATCA; and

(c) provide that UPC Broadband will have the right to appoint a successor Facility Agent
without the Lenders’ consent twice during the life of the Facilities,

and, in each case, permits the removal of the Security Agent as the joint creditor for the
purposes of any “parallel debt”.

61. **Assignments / Transfers of Lenders: clarify that the Borrower should have the right to**
withhold consent in respect of an assignment/transfer of any revolving credit facility to an
entity which is not a lender under a revolving facility to the wider Liberty group (subject to no
consent being required in the case of transfers to other Lenders or affiliates of Lenders or
following an event of default which is continuing). There should be no unreasonableness or
delay qualifier on this right (in respect of any revolving credit facility only) and no deemed
consent concept.

62. **Replacement of a Lender:** amend the Credit Agreement to include the right to replace a
Lender (in whole and at par) if the Obligor becomes obliged to make payment under
Illegality, Increased Costs, Tax Gross up or Tax Indemnity provisions to any Lender, if a
Lender invokes the provisions of Clause 11.2 (Market Disruption) or if a Lender is a
defaulting lender.

63. **Expenses: amend Clause 21.2 (Amendment costs) to make legal fees subject to any agreed**
caps; and Clause 22 (Stamp Duties) to ensure that any liability of the Borrower for the
payment of any tax (including stamp taxes) does not extend to taxes payable in respect of an
assignment or transfer of a Lender’s interest.

64. **Amendments:**

(a) amend Clause 25 (Amendments and waivers) to introduce a class exception, whereby
any amendment or waiver that relates only to the rights or obligations of a particular
utilisation or Facility and does not materially and adversely affect the rights or
interests of Lenders in respect of other utilisations or Facilities only requires the

35

49480224_5


-----

consent of the relevant proportion of Lenders participating in such Utilisation or
Facility;

(b) amend Clause 25.2 (Exceptions) to require the consent of affected Lenders only and
not all Lenders (and make any consequential changes by amending for example, all
references to matters requiring all Lender consent to only requiring affected Lender
consent);

(c) include a new paragraph (e) to Clause 25.2 (Exceptions), to permit the Facility Agent
to make technical, minor, operational and OID amendments without consent from any
Lenders, on terms consistent with recent Liberty precedent as at the date of
implementation of the amendments;

(d) include a new clause 25.5 (Calculation of Consent), such that where a request for a
waiver of, or an amendment to, any provision of any Finance Document has been sent
by the Facility Agent to the Lenders at the request of an Obligor, each Lender that
does not respond to such request for waiver or amendment within 10 Business Days
after receipt by it of such request (or within such other period as the Facility Agent
and UPC Broadband shall specify), shall be excluded from the calculation in
determining whether the requisite level of consent to such waiver or amendment was
granted; and

(e) include a new paragraph (f) of Clause 25.2 (Exceptions) such that the release of
guarantees and security under the Finance Documents (and not in accordance with the
Finance Documents) requires the consent of affected Lenders whose undrawn
Commitments and participations are greater than 90 per cent. of all undrawn
Commitments and participations and delete paragraph (a)(x) of Clause 25.2
(Exceptions).

65. **Covenant Compliance: disapply Clause 4.3 (Pro forma covenant compliance) so that there is**
no drawstop if the financial covenants would not be complied with in relation to a rollover of
a revolving credit facility Advance or the redrawing of a term Advance.

66. **Indemnification requirements: amend the Credit Agreement in respect of any indemnity**
granted by the Borrower to conform to recent Liberty precedent including, amongst others,
amending Clause 10.3 (Tax Indemnity) such that the indemnity is paid within 10 Business
Days and the loss is calculated on a reasonable basis.

67. **Non-consenting Lenders: include a provision whereby if 80 per cent. of affected Lenders**
have consented to a request for an amendment or waiver, UPC Broadband may elect to
replace any Lender that has not consented to such request by procuring that its relevant
Commitments are acquired at par in accordance with the provisions in recent Liberty
precedent.

68. **References: amend the Credit Agreement:**

(a) so that all references to any party include any assignees, transferees, successors in
title and merged entities thereof; and

(b) to take account of the fact that certain Facilities under the Credit Facility have been
(as at the date of this Agreement) repaid and cancelled in full.

36

49480224_5


-----

69. **Subsidiary: amend the definition of Subsidiary so that for the purposes of the financial**
covenants and related provisions that a “Subsidiary” of a person includes legal entity which is
accounted for under applicable GAAP or IFRS as a Subsidiary.

70. **Material Adverse Effect: amend definition of Material Adverse Effect so that it relates only**
to payment obligations and not “other material obligations”.

71. **Certain Funds Acquisitions: amend Clause 4.2 (Further Conditions Precedent) to provide**
that the relevant Additional Facility Lenders may amend or waive any of the conditions at
paragraphs (a) and (b) in relation to any Advance under an Additional Facility in relation to
an acquisition where the relevant vendor requires, or it is commercially advantageous in
connection with any competitive bid process that, such acquisition is completed on a certain
funds basis other than an Event of Default that has arisen under Clause 18.2 (Non-payment) or
Clauses 18.6 (Insolvency) to 18.10 (Similar proceedings).

72. **Calculation of EURIBOR/LIBOR:** amend the Credit Agreement to include provisions for
the calculation of EURIBOR/LIBOR in accordance with recent Liberty precedent and/or, to
the extent not inconsistent with recent Liberty precedent, the European leverage loan market
provided that in no circumstances will EURIBOR/LIBOR be deemed to be zero and to
include a requirement for the Facility Agent to notify the relevant Borrower of each funding
rate.

73. **Voluntary cancellation/prepayment: amend clauses 7.2 (Voluntary cancellation) and 7.3**
(Voluntary prepayment) to delete the references to delivering to the Facility Agent a duly
completed Cancellation Notice not less than “five” Business Days prior to the due date of the
cancellation/prepayment and replace it with a reference to not less than “three” Business Days
or such other time period agreed between UPC Broadband and the Facility Agent prior to the
due date of the cancellation/prepayment.

74. **Deferred Acquisition Costs: amend the thresholds in clause 4.4 (Deferred Acquisition**
_Costs) such that the reference to €100,000,000 is replaced with a reference to €250,000,000_
and the references to €150,000,000 are replaced with references to €300,000,000.

75. **Additional Facility Accession Agreement: amend the Additional Facility Accession**
Agreement definition to delete the reference to “with such amendments as the Facility Agent
may approve or reasonably require” and replace it with a reference to “with such amendments
as may be agreed between UPC Broadband and the relevant Lender or Lenders under the
proposed Additional Facility”.

76. **Guarantor Coverage: replace the reference to “95%” at paragraph (b)(i)(B) of Clause 26.4**

Broadband, any UPC Broadband Holdco, UPC Holding and UPC Holding II) and their
respective Subsidiaries” with “the Guarantors as of the Effective Date (other than UPC
Broadband, any UPC Broadband Holdco, UPC Holding, UPC Holding II and any Subsidiary
of UPC Broadband that is a Holding Company of all other Subsidiaries of UPC Broadband)
and their respective Subsidiaries”.

77. **UGCE Borrower Group: amend the definition of UGCE Borrower Group so that it refers to**
UPC Holding and any other company of which UPC Broadband is a Subsidiary and which is
a Subsidiary of UPC Holding.

78. **Benefit of Maintenance Covenant: amend the Credit Agreement to provide that:**

37

49480224_5


-----

(a) the maintenance covenants at Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios) shall only be for the
benefit of those Lenders under Additional Facilities that (i) are stated to have the
benefit of such maintenance covenants or (ii) do not contain a statement that they do

**OFFERING MEMORANDUM**


**NOT FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION**

**IN THE UNITED STATES**


**$800,000,000 5** **[3]⁄8% Senior Secured Notes due 2025**

**issued by**

#### UPCB Finance IV Limited

UPCB Finance IV Limited, incorporated as an exempted company limited by shares under the laws of the

Cayman Islands (the “Issuer”) and owned 100% by a charitable trust, is offering $800 million aggregate principal
amount of its 5 [3]⁄8% senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Dollar Notes”). The Dollar Notes will mature on January
15, 2025. The Issuer will pay interest on the Dollar Notes semi-annually in cash on each January 15 and July 15,
commencing on January 15, 2016.

The proceeds from the offering of the Dollar Notes will be used by the Issuer to fund an additional facility

under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (as defined in this Offering Memorandum) (the “Dollar Finco
Loan”), denominated in U.S. dollars and borrowed by UPC Financing Partnership (“UPC Financing”). UPC
Financing is an entity indirectly wholly-owned by UPC Holding B.V. (“UPC Holding”). The Issuer is dependent
upon payments under the Dollar Finco Loan and related agreements to make payments under the Dollar Notes. The
Issuer will apply payments it receives under the Dollar Finco Loan and such related agreements, including in respect
of principal, premiums and interest, to make corresponding payments under the Dollar Notes.

The accession agreement related to the Dollar Finco Loan will provide for the payment of certain premiums

in connection with certain voluntary and mandatory prepayments of the Dollar Finco Loan that will enable the
Issuer to pay the premiums payable in respect of corresponding redemptions of the Dollar Notes, as described in
“Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase”. Some or all of the Dollar Notes may be redeemed at
any time prior to January 15, 2020, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes
redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the redemption date and the “make whole”
premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. The Dollar Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after
January 15, 2020 at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, at any time prior
to January 15, 2018, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the Dollar Notes with the net proceeds of one or more
specified equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Prior to January 15,
2020, during each 12-month period commencing on the Issue Date (as defined herein), the Issuer may redeem up
to 10% of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the redemption date.

Following a change of control as defined under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, UPC Broadband

Holding B.V. (“UPC Broadband Holding”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC Holding, and UPC Financing
will be required to, at the election of the Majority Lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility,
prepay the Dollar Finco Loan plus a payment equal to 1% of the principal amount of the Dollar Finco Loan.
Following such repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Dollar Notes issued under the indenture governing
the Dollar Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption upon a Change of Control”. In the
event of certain asset sales, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing may elect, at their option, to (i) offer to
prepay a principal amount of the Dollar Finco Loan in an aggregate amount equal to the principal amount of the
Dollar Notes tendered in the related asset sale offer to be made by the Issuer (not to exceed the available
proceeds from the related asset sale) or (ii) subject to the payment of certain premiums, repay the Dollar Finco
Loan pro rata with the other Finco Loans (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) in an amount equal to the
available proceeds from the related asset sale, and, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence, the Issuer
will redeem a corresponding amount of the Dollar Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption and
_Repurchase—Disposal Proceeds”. Further, the Dollar Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to their principal_
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law and, subject to certain
limitations, in connection with a UPC Exchange Transaction (as defined in this Offering Memorandum). See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the
_Notes—Redemption and Repurchase—Special Optional Redemption in connection with a UPC Exchange_
_Transaction”._


-----

Neither UPC Holding nor any of its subsidiaries will guarantee or provide any credit support to the Issuer with

respect to its obligations under the Dollar Notes. Other than under the limited circumstances described herein,
holders of the Dollar Notes will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of UPC Holding or any of its
subsidiaries, and neither UPC Holding nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay
amounts due under the Dollar Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of UPC Financing to make payments to the Issuer pursuant to the Dollar Finco Loan and agreements
related thereto.

The Dollar Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer. The Dollar Notes will be secured by, among other

things, a first ranking security interest over the Issuer’s rights to and benefit in the Dollar Finco Loan (including
all rights of the Issuer as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility). In addition, other than in
certain limited circumstances specified herein, holders of the Dollar Notes will not have any recourse to the
Issuer other than in respect of amounts received by the Issuer under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
and the related agreements. For a description of the terms of the Notes, see “Description of the Notes”.

Concurrently with the offering of the Dollar Notes, the Issuer is offering €416.5 million aggregate principal

(and such additional amounts in excess thereof that the Issuer may elect to issue) amount of its senior secured
notes due 2027 (the “Euro Notes”, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes”). For further details about the
Concurrent Euro Notes Offering (as defined in the Offering Memorandum), see “General Description of UPC
_Holding’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Brief Description of the Structure of the Offering of the Dollar_
_Notes hereby and the Concurrent Euro Notes Offering”._

**See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 30 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in**

**connection with an investment in any of the Dollar Notes.**

**The Dollar Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as**

**amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Issuer is offering**
**the Dollar Notes only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S.**
**Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under**
**the U.S. Securities Act. For a description of certain restrictions on the transfer of the Dollar Notes see**
**“Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.**

Application will be made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Dollar Notes to be admitted to listing on its

Official List and trading on its Global Exchange Market.

The Dollar Notes will be in registered form in denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000

in excess thereof. The Dollar Notes will be represented on issue by one or more global notes, which will be
delivered through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), on or about April 15, 2015 (the “Issue Date”).

limited circumstances. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**any information or represent anything to you other than the information contained in this Offering**
**Memorandum. You must not rely on unauthorized information or representations.**

**This Offering Memorandum does not offer to sell or ask for offers to buy any of the securities in any**

**jurisdiction where it is unlawful, where the person making the offer is not qualified to do so, or to any**
**person who cannot legally be offered the securities.**

**The information in this Offering Memorandum is current only as of the date on the cover page, and**

**may change after that date. For any time after the cover date of this Offering Memorandum, UPC Holding**
**does not represent that its affairs are the same as described or that the information in this Offering**
**Memorandum is correct, nor does UPC Holding imply those things by delivering this Offering**
**Memorandum or selling securities to you. UPC Holding will not guarantee or provide any credit support**
**to the Issuer with respect to its obligations under the Dollar Notes.**

**The Issuer and the Dollar Initial Purchasers are offering to sell the Dollar Notes only in places where**

**offers and sales are permitted.**

The Issuer is offering the Dollar Notes in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the

U.S. Securities Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering.
The Dollar Notes have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or any other securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC
or any such securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Offering
Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

This Offering Memorandum is being provided for informational use solely in connection with consideration

of a purchase of the Dollar Notes (i) to U.S. investors that the Issuer reasonably believes to be qualified
institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, and (ii) to certain persons in offshore
transactions complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Its use for any
other purpose is not authorized. This Offering Memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part
nor may it be distributed or any of its contents be disclosed to anyone other than the qualified institutional buyers
described in (i) above or to persons considering a purchase of the Dollar Notes in offshore transactions described
in (ii) above.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) are investment professionals, as such

term is defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order
2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high
net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the
United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”)) in connection with
the issue or sale of any Dollar Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated
(all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only
at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant
persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Dollar Notes will be made

pursuant to an exemption under Article 3 of Directive 2003/71/EC as amended (including by Directive
2010/73/EU) (the “Prospectus Directive”), as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area
(the “EEA”), from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person
making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which
no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. None of
the Issuer, UPC Holding or the Initial Purchasers has authorized, nor does any of them authorize, the making of
any offer of the Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers which
constitute the final placement of the Dollar Notes contemplated in this Offering Memorandum.

The Dollar Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold

except as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws. See “Transfer
_Restrictions”. You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an_
indefinite period of time.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Information**

Unless otherwise indicated, the historical consolidated financial information presented herein has been

prepared in compliance with U.S. GAAP.

This Offering Memorandum includes the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements of UPC

Holding and its subsidiaries. UPC Holding’s consolidated subsidiaries include UPC Financing and UPC
Broadband Holding. UPC Holding’s historical results do not necessarily indicate results that may be expected for
any future period.

This Offering Memorandum also includes the Issuer’s financial statements as of December 31, 2014.

Financial statements will be published by the Issuer on an annual basis and the Issuer will not prepare interim
financial statements.

As further described under “General Description of UPC Holding’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—

_The Issuer and Consolidation of the Issuer by UPC Holding” below, following the issuance of the Notes and the_
related advance of the proceeds to UPC Financing pursuant to the Finco Loans, UPC Financing and its parent
entities, including UPC Holding, will consolidate the Issuer.

The financial results of UPC Holding are reported in euros. Unless otherwise indicated, all convenience

translations into euros have also been calculated as of December 31, 2014. Certain amounts and percentages
presented herein have been rounded and, accordingly, may not total.

The comparability of UPC Holding’s operating results for the periods presented in this Offering

Memorandum is affected by acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For additional
information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Results of Operations”. In addition, UPC Holding’s December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet and its_
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, owners’ deficit and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements have been
retrospectively revised to give effect to a common control transfer. For additional information, see note 4 to the
December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Pro Forma Financial Information**

The unaudited condensed pro forma financial information included in this Offering Memorandum has not

been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or the
Prospectus Directive. Although UPC Holding has used U.S. GAAP as the basis in preparing the unaudited
condensed pro forma financial information, such pro forma financial information has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions
underlying the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

The summary unaudited pro forma balance sheet data gives effect to (i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC

NL Transfer, (iii) the Corporate Entities Transfer and (iv) the Early 2015 Refinancings, as if such transactions had
occurred on December 31, 2014. The summary unaudited pro forma statement of operations data gives effect to
(i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC NL Transfer, (iii) the Corporate Entities Transfer and (iv) the 2015
Liberty Global Allocation Methodology (as defined and described under Certain Relationships and Related-Party
Transactions of UPC Holding), as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2012. The unaudited condensed
pro forma financial information is presented for information purposes only. The unaudited condensed pro forma
financial statement data, which has been prepared on a U.S. GAAP basis, does not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that UPC Holding would have obtained if the above transactions were effective as of January 1,
2012 and does not purport to project the results of operations or financial condition of UPC Holding for any future
period. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and upon certain assumptions
that UPC Holding believes are reasonable. The pro forma information has been derived from, and should be read in
conjunction with, the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements as well as “Presentation of Financial
_and Other Information”, “General Description of UPC Holding’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Recent_
_Developments of UPC Holding”, “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations of UPC Holding” and “Risk Factors” included elsewhere herein._

**SUBSCRIBER, MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

**Subscriber Data**

Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit (“RGU”) for each service subscribed. Thus, a

subscriber who receives from UPC Holding cable television, broadband internet and telephony services
(regardless of their number of telephony access lines) would be counted as three RGUs. The subscriber data
included in this Offering Memorandum, including penetration rates, average monthly subscription revenue
earned per average RGU (“ARPU”) are determined by management, are not part of UPC Holding’s financial
statements and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by an outside auditor, consultant or expert or by any
of the Initial Purchasers.

**Market and Industry Data**

UPC Holding operates in an industry in which it is difficult to obtain precise market and industry

information. UPC Holding has generally obtained the market and competitive position data in this Offering
Memorandum from industry publications and from surveys or studies conducted by third party sources that it
believes to be reliable.

However, none of the Issuer, UPC Holding, the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective advisors can

verify the accuracy and completeness of such information and none of the Issuer, UPC Holding, the Initial
Purchasers or any of their respective advisors has independently verified such market and position data. UPC
Holding and the Issuer do, however, accept responsibility for the correct reproduction of this information and, as
far as they are aware and are able to ascertain from information published, no facts have been omitted that would
render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.

In addition, in many cases UPC Holding has made statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding its

industry and its position in the industry based on its experience and its own investigation of market conditions.
None of the Issuer, UPC Holding, the Initial Purchasers or any of their respective advisors can assure you that
any of these assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect its position in the industry, and none of its internal
surveys or information has been verified by independent sources.

The Issuer and UPC Holding disclose important factors that could cause their actual results to differ

materially from their expectations in this Offering Memorandum. These cautionary statements qualify all
forward-looking statements attributable to the Issuer or UPC Holding or persons acting on their behalf. When
UPC Holding indicates that an event, condition or circumstance could or would have an adverse effect on it, it
means to include effects upon business, financial and other conditions, results of operations and ability to make

payments under the Notes.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UPC HOLDING’S BUSINESS, THE ISSUER AND THE OFFERING**

This general description of UPC Holding’s business, the Issuer and the offering highlights selected

information contained in this Offering Memorandum regarding UPC Holding, the Issuer and the Dollar Notes. It
does not contain all the information you should consider prior to investing in the Dollar Notes. You should read
the entire Offering Memorandum carefully, including the “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of UPC Holding”, and the December 31, 2014_
Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes to those financial statements included in this Offering
Memorandum. Please see page G-1 of this Offering Memorandum for a glossary of technical terms used in this
Offering Memorandum.

**UPC Holding’s Business**

UPC Holding is a subsidiary of Liberty Global and provides video, broadband internet and fixed-line

telephony across seven European countries. Following the transfer of UPC Nederland B.V. and UPC Broadband
Ireland Ltd. and their respective subsidiaries (as described below), UPC Holding’s cable networks pass
approximately 12.2 million homes. One of UPC Holding’s largest cable networks is in Switzerland, where it
operates under the UPC Cablecom brand. In addition, UPC Holding has cable networks in Austria and in the
Central and Eastern European countries of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic and Slovakia, operating
under the UPC brand, as well as certain direct-to-home satellite (DTH) operations in Hungary, Romania, Czech
Republic and Slovakia. In addition, in Switzerland, Austria and Hungary, UPC Holding also offers mobile
services using third-party networks through mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), and in Poland
UPC Holding maintains a small legacy MVNO.

In its Swiss/Austrian business, UPC Holding provides cable broadband services over its cable broadband

network to approximately 2.1 million customers and 3.9 million RGUs. The services are transmitted over a
hybrid fiber coaxial cable network, which is composed primarily of fiber optics with only the last part, which
connects the customer to the network, composed of coaxial cable. The basic video services in Switzerland and
Austria are unencrypted, allowing customers with the necessary equipment and an analog subscription to also
access UPC Holding’s basic digital services. In 2015, UPC Holding plans to stop offering analog services in
Switzerland. In both Switzerland and Austria, UPC Holding launched mobile voice and data services during 2014
on a full-MVNO basis. Although only approximately 31% of UPC Holding’s customer relationships are located
in Switzerland and Austria, this Western European customer base was responsible for approximately 59% of the
revenue of UPC Holding for the year ended December 31, 2014 (after giving effect to the UPC Ireland Transfer
and the UPC NL Transfer (each as defined herein)).

After giving effect to the UPC Ireland Transfer, the UPC NL Transfer, the Corporate Entities Transfer (each

as defined herein) and the impact of these transfers on intercompany accounts, UPC Holding generated pro forma
revenue of €2,337.8 million and operating cash flow of €1,231.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
For further information regarding the business of UPC Holding and the services it provides to customers, see
“Business of UPC Holding” in this Offering Memorandum.

**The Issuer and Consolidation of the Issuer by UPC Holding**

The Issuer was incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on February 1, 2011 as a special purpose

financing company for the primary purpose of facilitating the offering of the Notes and is owned 100% by a
charitable trust. The authorized share capital of the Issuer is $50,000 divided into 50,000 shares of $1.00 each,
250 of which have been issued. All of the issued shares of the Issuer are fully-paid and are held by MaplesFS
Limited as share trustee (in such capacity, the “Share Trustee”) under the terms of the Declaration of Trust.
These shares will be subject to the Share Charge granted by the Share Trustee in favor of the Security Agent.

The Issuer has no material business operations and upon completion of this offering will have no material

assets other than the Finco Loans advanced in connection with the offering of the Notes and its rights under
certain related agreements. The Issuer has not engaged in any business activities or incurred any material
liabilities since the date of its incorporation, other than relating to this offering and transactions related thereto.
The proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be loaned by the Issuer to UPC Financing pursuant to the Finco
Loans. The Issuer is dependent on payments by UPC Financing under the Euro Finco Loan and the Dollar Finco
Loan in order to service its obligations under the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes, respectively. Although


1


-----

UPC Financing has no equity or voting interest in the Issuer, the Finco Loans create a variable interest in the
Issuer for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As such, UPC
Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding, will be required by the provisions of U.S. GAAP to
consolidate the Issuer following the issuance of the Notes. Accordingly, following the issuance of the Notes, the
Finco Loans will be eliminated through the consolidation of the Issuer within UPC Holding’s consolidated
financial statements. See “Risk Factors—Holders of the Notes have limited recourse to the Issuer, as payments
_under the Notes are limited to the amount of certain payments received by the Issuer under the UPC Broadband_
_Holding Bank Facility and the related agreements”._

**Brief Description of the Structure of the Offering of the Dollar Notes hereby and the Concurrent Euro**
**Notes Offering**

Concurrently with the offering of the Dollar Notes hereby, the Issuer is offering €416.5 million aggregate

principal amount of its senior secured Euro Notes due 2027, and may elect to raise additional Euro Notes in the
Concurrent Euro Notes Offering (in excess of €416.5 million), with the net proceeds from any such additional
Euro Notes expected to refinance existing indebtedness of the subsidiaries of UPC Holding. The Euro Notes will
mature on January 15, 2027, and the Issuer will pay interest on the Euro Notes semi-annually in cash on each
January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2016.

In connection with the offering of the Dollar Notes hereby and the Concurrent Euro Notes Offering, the

Issuer will enter into a Facility AL Finco Accession Agreement and a Facility AK Finco Accession Agreement,
respectively, with UPC Financing and the facility agent under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
pursuant to which the Issuer will make available to UPC Financing additional facilities under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar
Notes and the Euro Notes, respectively, issued in the offering. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will advance the net
proceeds of the issuance of the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes, together with the fees payable to it by UPC
Financing under the Fee Letter, to UPC Financing pursuant to the Facility AK Finco Accession Agreement and
the Facility AL Finco Accession Agreement, respectively. The principal amount of the Euro Notes and the
principal amount of the Dollar Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and currency,
among other things, with respect to the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes will be substantially identical to the
corresponding provisions of the relevant Finco Loan.

The Issuer, as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (a “UPCB Lender”, and together

with the other lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the “UPCB Lenders”), will be treated
the same as all other lenders under that facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to
those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other UPCB Lenders. Through the covenants in the Indenture
and the security interests over all of the issued shares of the Issuer and the Finco Loans granted to secure the
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of Notes will be provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and
protections granted to the Issuer as a UPCB Lender, including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained in
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and of the security granted for the benefit of the UPCB Lenders. See
“Description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”. Thus, in the case of the ongoing obligations of
UPC Broadband Holding and its subsidiaries (the “UPCB Group”) and UPC Financing under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Issuer will be treated in the same way as the other UPCB Lenders,
with the right to vote as part of the lending group on the basis described in the “Description of the Notes” and to
receive principal and interest on the Finco Loans, which it will in turn use to make payments on the relevant
series of Notes. For a description of procedures under the Indenture, the Facility AK Finco Accession Agreement
and the Facility AL Finco Accession Agreement regarding voting rights of holders of the Notes with respect to
decisions under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see below under “Description of the Notes—
_Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or the Finco Accession_
_Agreements”. Although the Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other UPCB Lenders in all matters_
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Issuer will give its consent to certain amendments to the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility that UPC Broadband Holding may request in the future at the time it
enters into the Finco Accession Agreements and therefore, will not be entitled to vote on any future request for
such amendments. For a description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments, see
“Description of the Notes—Finco Accession Agreement and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”.

Under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, to the extent the UPCB Group is in compliance with

certain financial ratios, the borrowers under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, at their discretion and


2


-----

without the consent of the UPCB Lenders, are permitted to incur additional pari passu indebtedness pursuant to
additional facilities under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, which benefit from the protections
provided to all UPCB Lenders, including the representations and warranties, covenants, guarantees and security
provided thereunder. For a further description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see “Description of
_the Notes—Description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”. However, the UPC Broadband Holding_
Bank Facility limits the ability of the UPCB Group to directly issue the Notes. As a result, this structure for this
offering of the Dollar Notes and the Concurrent Euro Notes Offering has been created pursuant to which the
Issuer will loan the proceeds of this offering of the Notes to UPC Financing, thus indirectly affording holders of
Notes the ability to participate in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

On the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the offering of the Euro Notes, together with the fees payable to it by

UPC Financing under the Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund a loan borrowed under an additional
facility (Facility AK) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to
the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes, and the net proceeds of the offering of the Dollar Notes,
together with the fees payable to it by UPC Financing under the Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund a
loan borrowed under an additional facility (Facility AL) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes. In addition to indirect
benefits arising from the protections and security afforded to the Issuer as a UPCB Lender in respect of Facility
AK and Facility AL, holders of Notes will also benefit directly from the first-ranking security interests in the
Collateral granted to the security agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, as described in
“Description of the Notes—Security”.

**UNAUDITED CONDENSED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND OPERATING DATA OF**

**UPC HOLDING**

During the first quarter of 2015, Liberty Global completed certain internal reorganizations of its broadband

and wireless communications businesses in Europe, including (i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC NL
Transfer and (iii) the Corporate Entities Transfer.

The tables below set out certain summary unaudited pro forma financial data of UPC Holding as of

December 31, 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The following summary
unaudited pro forma balance sheet data gives effect to (i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC NL Transfer,
(iii) the Corporate Entities Transfer and (iv) the Early 2015 Refinancings, as if such transactions had occurred on
December 31, 2014. The following summary unaudited pro forma statement of operations data gives effect to
(i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC NL Transfer, (iii) the Corporate Entities Transfer and (iv) the 2015
Liberty Global Allocation Methodology (as defined and described under “Certain Relationships and Related_Party Transactions of UPC Holding”), as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2012. The pro forma_
adjustments pursuant to the Corporate Entities Transfer represent the historical amounts of Liberty Global
Services II and Liberty Global Operations during the applicable periods as reflected in UPC Holding’s
accounting records. Liberty Global Services II and Liberty Global Operations incur certain of Liberty Global’s
central and other administrative costs.

The unaudited condensed pro forma financial statement data, which has been prepared on a U.S. GAAP

basis, does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that UPC Holding would have obtained if the
above transactions were effective as of January 1, 2012. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently
available information and upon certain assumptions that UPC Holding believes are reasonable. The pro forma
information has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the December 31, 2014 Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere herein as well as “Presentation of Financial and Other Information”,
“General Description of UPC Holding’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Recent Developments of UPC
_Holding”, “Managements’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of UPC_
_Holding” and “Risk Factors”. In addition, this section includes a reconciliation of the actual results of UPC_
Holding as reported in the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements to the summary unaudited pro
forma balance sheet and statement of operations data presented below.

The unaudited condensed pro forma financial information included in this Offering Memorandum has not

been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or the
Prospectus Directive. Although UPC Holding has used U.S. GAAP as the basis in preparing the unaudited
condensed pro forma financial information, such pro forma financial information has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions
underlying the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

(b) Segment OCF is the primary measure used by UPC Holding’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate
segment operating performance. Segment OCF is also a key factor that is used by UPC Holding’s internal
decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of
our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As UPC Holding uses the
term, segment OCF is defined as revenue less operating and selling, general and administrative expenses
(excluding share-based compensation, related-party fees and allocations, depreciation and amortization and
impairment, restructuring and other operating items). Other operating items include (a) gains and losses on
the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful
acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other
acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. UPC
Holding’s internal decision makers believe segment OCF is a meaningful measure and is superior to
available U.S. GAAP measures because it represents a transparent view of UPC Holding’s recurring
operating performance that is unaffected by UPC Holding’s capital structure and allows management to
(1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments
and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate.
UPC Holding believes its segment OCF measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for
comparing UPC Holding’s performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar
industries, although UPC Holding’s measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by
other public companies. Segment OCF should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a
supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, net earnings (loss), cash flow from operating
activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or cash flows. A reconciliation of total segment OCF to
UPC Holding’s operating income is presented below:

(c) Other Liberty Global subsidiaries provide various services and benefits to UPC Holding. The resulting
charges for these services and benefits are based on actual costs plus a mark-up or on other methodologies
that are designed to result in market-based charges. In connection with the first quarter 2015 implementation
of the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology, as defined and described under “Certain Relationships
_and Related-Party Transactions of UPC Holding”, these fees and allocations will be segregated into three_
components to provide additional information regarding the underlying costs that are incurred by the Liberty
Global subsidiaries that provide the services and benefits to UPC Holding, as follows:

    - _Operating and SG&A related (exclusive of depreciation and amortization and share-based_
_compensation). The amounts included in this category, which will be cash settled, will represent UPC_
Holding’s estimated share of certain centralized technology, management, marketing, finance and other
operating and SG&A expenses of Liberty Global’s European operations, whose activities benefit
multiple operations, including operations within and outside of UPC Holding. The amounts allocated
will represent UPC Holding’s estimated share of the actual costs incurred by Liberty Global’s
European operations, without a mark-up.

    - _Depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation. The amounts included in this category,_
which will be loan settled, will represent UPC Holding’s estimated share of (i) depreciation and
amortization of assets not owned by UPC Holding and (ii) share-based compensation associated with
Liberty Global employees who are not employees of UPC Holding. The amounts allocated will
represent UPC Holding’s estimated share of the actual costs incurred by Liberty Global’s European
operations, without a mark-up.

    - _Management Fee. The amounts included in this category, which will be loan settled, will represent_
UPC Holding’s estimated allocable share of (i) operating and SG&A expenses related to the
stewardship services provided by certain Liberty Global subsidiaries and (ii) any mark-up included in
all components of the related-party fees and allocations charged to our company.

The tables below set out certain summary unaudited pro forma operating data of UPC Holding as of

December 31, 2014. The following summary unaudited pro forma operating data gives effect to (i) the UPC
Ireland Transfer and (ii) the UPC NL Transfer as if such transactions had occurred on December 31, 2014.

(e) Operating cash flow is the primary measure used by UPC Holding’s management to evaluate segment
operating performance. Operating cash flow is also a key factor that is used by UPC Holding’s internal
decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of
UPC Holding’s management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As UPC
Holding uses the term, operating cash flow is defined as revenue less operating and SG&A expenses
(excluding share-based compensation, related-party fees and allocations, depreciation and amortization and
impairment, restructuring and other operating items). Other operating items include (i) gains and losses on
the disposition of long-lived assets, (ii) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful
acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (iii) other
acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. UPC
Holding’s internal decision makers believe operating cash flow is a meaningful measure and is superior to
available U.S. GAAP measures because it represents a transparent view of UPC Holding’s recurring
operating performance that is unaffected by UPC Holding’s capital structure and allows management to
(i) readily view operating trends, (ii) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments
and (iii) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which UPC
Holding operates. UPC Holding believes its operating cash flow measure is useful to investors because it is
one of the bases for comparing UPC Holding’s performance with the performance of other companies in the
same or similar industries, although UPC Holding’s measure may not be directly comparable to similar
measures used by other companies. Operating cash flow should be viewed as a measure of operating
performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income (loss), net earnings (loss),
cash flow from operating activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or cash flows. A
reconciliation of operating cash flow to operating income is as follows:

(1) Annualized EBITDA is calculated by multiplying EBITDA (as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility), including the impact of (i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC NL Transfer and (iii) the
Corporate Entities Transfer, which results in a decrease of €517.4 million (€258.7 million multiplied by
two), for the six months ended December 31, 2014 (€614.7 million) by two. Annualized EBITDA and
EBITDA may differ from the segment operating cash flow amounts reported for the corresponding periods.

(2) As adjusted annualized EBITDA includes allocated costs of €80.6 million related to the “Operating and
SG&A related (exclusive of depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation)” category of
related-party fees and allocations, net, as described above under “Unaudited Condensed Pro Forma
_Financial Statement and Operating Data of UPC Holding”. These allocated costs include a decrease of_
€23.0 million related to the impact of Liberty Global’s acquisition of Ziggo Holding B.V. (formerly Ziggo
N.V.) and the resulting decrease in costs allocated to UPC Holding.

(3) As adjusted covenant senior net debt is calculated for the subsidiaries of UPC Holding and does not include
debt of UPC Holding.

(4) As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as adjusted total covenant net debt are calculated in
accordance with the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and are adjusted to give effect to the Early 2015
Refinancings, the issuance of the Dollar Notes offered hereby and the Euro Notes offered in the Concurrent
Euro Notes Offering and the Refinancing, as applicable. As adjusted total covenant senior net debt and as
adjusted total covenant net debt presented here differ from the calculation of “Indebtedness” under the
“Consolidated Leverage Ratio” under certain of the indentures governing the UPC Holding Senior Notes.
The amounts shown take into account currency swaps and do not include deferred financing fees, accrued
interest, premiums or discounts, and accordingly, may differ from the debt figures that are reported under
“Capitalization of UPC Holding”.

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The** holders of the Dollar Notes will benefit directly from

first-ranking security interests granted to the Security Agent on behalf
of the Trustee and the holders of the Dollar Notes in the following
rights, property and assets:

(1) all of the issued shares of the Issuer;

(2) all of the assets of the Issuer (excluding the proceeds of the paid
up share capital of the Issuer and any transaction fees payable to
the Issuer pursuant to the Expenses Agreement and excluding as
provided below) including:

(a) the Issuer’s rights to and benefit in the Dollar Finco Loan
(including all rights of the Issuer as a UPCB Lender under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the Facility AL Finco
Accession Agreement);

(b) the Issuer’s rights under the Deed of Covenant;

(c) the Issuer’s rights under the Fee Letter;

(d) the Issuer’s rights under the Expenses Agreement (excluding the
Issuer’s rights to be indemnified in respect of fees, costs,
expenses and any other amounts payable to parties that do not
benefit from the security interests in the Collateral); and

(e) sums of money held from time to time in all bank accounts of the
Issuer (excluding the bank account in which the Issuer has
deposited the proceeds of its share capital ($250.00) and the
transaction fee ($250.00)).

The Issuer, as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility, will be treated the same as all other lenders under that
facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are similar
to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other UPCB
Lenders. Through the covenants in the Indenture and the security
interests over all of the issued shares of the Issuer and the Dollar
Finco Loan granted to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Dollar
Notes, the holders of the Dollar Notes will be provided indirectly with
the benefits, rights and protections granted to the Issuer as a UPCB
Lender, including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained in
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and of the security granted
for the benefit of the UPCB Lenders.

amount of the Dollar Finco Loan in an amount equal to the principal
amount of the Dollar Notes tendered in the related asset sale offer to be
made by the Issuer (not to exceed the available proceeds from the related
asset sale) or (ii) subject to the payment of certain premiums, repay the
Dollar Finco Loan in an amount equal to the available proceeds from the
related asset sale, and, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) the Issuer will

**Special optional redemption in**

**connection with a UPC Exchange**
**Transaction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . At any time following the Issue Date, the Issuer may, at its option,**

initiate a UPC Exchange Transaction, pursuant to which it will make
an offer to all holders of the Dollar Notes to exchange their Dollar
Notes for senior secured notes issued by UPC Broadband Holding or
UPC Financing.

If, among other requirements, a majority of the aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Dollar Notes elect to participate in such
UPC Exchange Transaction and UPC Broadband Holding or UPC
Financing, as the case may be, accepts for exchange all Dollar Notes
tendered in such UPC Exchange Transaction, UPC Broadband
Holding or UPC Financing, as the case may be, will be entitled to
prepay all, but not less than all, of the remaining principal amount of
the corresponding Dollar Finco Loan. In order to effect any such
prepayment, either UPC Broadband Holding or UPC Financing, as
the case may be, is required to give notice of such prepayment to the
Issuer not later than three Business Days prior to the completion of
such UPC Exchange Transaction and make such prepayment on the
completion date of such UPC Exchange Transaction.

The Issuer will redeem all, but not less than all, of the Dollar Notes
issued under the Indenture not exchanged in the UPC Exchange
Transaction on the date of the prepayment of the Dollar Finco Loan
described above, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to the date of redemption.

A UPC Exchange Transaction means an exchange offer by UPC
Broadband or UPC Financing, as applicable, pursuant to which UPC
Qualified Notes (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) are offered
in exchange for all outstanding Dollar Notes issued under the
Indenture; provided, that:

(i) no Default or Event of Default (each as defined in “Description
_of the Notes”) has occurred and is continuing at the time any such_
exchange offer is made or would result therefrom;

(ii) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the

outstanding relevant series of Notes have elected to participate in
such offer;

(iii) for each $1,000 in principal amount of Dollar Notes tendered and

accepted, each holder tendering such Dollar Notes will receive
$1,000 in principal amount of UPC Qualified Notes;

(iv) the exchange offer complies with Rule 14e-1 under the U.S.

Exchange Act and any other applicable securities law or
regulation;

(v) UPC Broadband or UPC Financing, as applicable, accepts for
exchange all Dollar Notes tendered in such exchange offer and
issues the relevant UPC Qualified Notes in exchange therefor;

(vi) the exchange offer is open to all holders of the Dollar Notes on

substantially similar terms, subject to certain exceptions

described under “Description of the Notes”; and

(vii) the exchange offer is not conditioned upon holders of the Dollar

Notes consenting to any amendments to the terms of the Dollar
Notes or the Indenture.

**Additional amounts; tax**

**redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . All payments in respect of the Dollar Notes will be made without**

withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental
charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or
deduction is required by law, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer
will pay additional amounts so that the net amount you receive is no
less than that which you would have received in the absence of such
withholding or deduction. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—_

_Withholding Taxes”. The Issuer may redeem the Dollar Notes in_
whole, but not in part, at any time, upon giving prior notice, in the
event of an optional prepayment of the Dollar Finco Loan pursuant to
Clause 7.9(a)(i) (Right of prepayment and cancellation in relation to a
single Lender) of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or if
certain changes in tax law impose certain withholding taxes on
amounts payable on the Notes and, as a result, the Issuer is required to
pay additional amounts with respect to such withholding taxes. If the
Issuer decides to exercise such redemption right, it must pay holders a
redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Dollar Notes
being redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Redemption and
_Repurchase—Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes”._

**Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer will issue the Dollar Notes under the Indenture. The**

consents under the Loan Documents; payments for consent;

amendments to the Loan Documents to be applied equally to all
lenders; and information.

**Voting in respect of the Finco Loan**

**Bank Facility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer will vote as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding**

Bank Facility pursuant to the Dollar Finco Loan. The voting method
to be used to determine the voting position of the Issuer on any matter
subject to a lender vote under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility is described under “Description of the Notes—Amendment,
_Supplement and Waiver—To the UPC Broadband Holding Bank_
_Facility or the Finco Accession Agreements”._

The Facility AL Finco Accession Agreement contains the advance
consent of the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, to certain amendments to the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility that UPC Broadband Holding
may request in the future. Although the Issuer will have the same
voting rights as the other UPCB Lenders in all matters under the UPC

_An investment in the Dollar Notes involves risks. Before purchasing the Dollar Notes, you should consider_

_carefully the specific risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Offering_
_Memorandum. If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, this could_
_have a material adverse impact on the Issuer’s and UPC Holding’s business, prospects, results of operations and_
_financial condition and could therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of the Dollar Notes and UPC_
_Holding’s ability to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Dollar Finco Loan, and in turn, would have_
_an adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Dollar Notes. Although described below and_
_elsewhere in this document are the risks considered to be the most material, there may be other unknown or_
_unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse_
_effects on the Issuer’s or UPC Holding’s results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the_
_future. In addition, past financial performance of UPC Holding may not be a reliable indicator of future_
_performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._

_Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Relating to UPC Holding’s Financial Profile**

**_UPC Holding’s substantial leverage could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under the Finco Loans, and in turn, prevent the Issuer_**
**_from fulfilling its obligations under the Notes._**

UPC Holding is highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2014, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to

the Early 2015 Refinancings and the issuance of the Notes, the funding of the Finco Loans and the application of
the proceeds thereof, the carrying amount of UPC Holding’s total consolidated third-party debt and capital lease
obligations would have been approximately €5.3 billion (excluding approximately €5.4 billion of UPC Holding
Shareholder Subordinated Loans). Of this as adjusted indebtedness, €1.3 billion (equivalent) represents the
aggregate principal amount outstanding under the UPCH Notes, €1.3 billion (equivalent) represents indebtedness
outstanding under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (excluding Facility AC, Facility AD and the Finco
Loans), €1.1 billion (equivalent) represents the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the UPCB Notes
and €1.2 billion represents the aggregate principal amount of the Notes offered hereby.

From time to time, UPC Holding may raise additional indebtedness, including additional capital markets

indebtedness, to, inter alia, refinance tranches of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and extend
maturities. UPC Holding will be permitted to incur additional indebtedness in the future to the extent such
indebtedness is incurred in compliance with certain covenants included in the indentures governing the
UPCH Notes and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. Based on UPC Holding’s covenant compliance
calculations as of December 31, 2014, and as adjusted for the 2015 Early Refinancings, the Transfers, the
issuance of the Dollar Notes offered hereby, the issuance of the Euro Notes offered in the Concurrent Euro Notes
Offering and the Refinancing, approximately €859.5 million was available for borrowing under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. See the discussions under the heading “Description of the UPC
_Broadband Holding Bank Facility” and heading “Description of Other Indebtedness of UPC Holding” for further_
information about UPC Holding’s substantial debt. Furthermore, UPC Holding’s ability to incur additional
indebtedness may increase to the extent the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments are approved
and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is so amended. See “Description of the Notes—Finco Accession
_Agreements and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”._

Because the Issuer has no material operations and no material assets other than the Finco Loans,

UPC Holding’s high level of debt could have important consequences for you as a holder of the Notes including,
but not limited to:

    - making it more difficult for UPC Holding to satisfy its obligations under the Finco Loans, and in turn
making it more difficult for the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes;

30


-----

    - requiring UPC Holding to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to payments
on its debt, thereby reducing the funds available to it to finance its operations, capital expenditures,
working capital, research and development and other general corporate purposes, including maintaining
the quality of its network and product performance;

    - placing UPC Holding at a competitive disadvantage compared to other broadband communications
providers in its key markets that have less debt than it does;

    - limiting UPC Holding’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the
competitive and economic environment in which it operates; and

    - impeding UPC Holding’s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, and increasing the cost
of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on UPC Holding’s ability

to satisfy its debt obligations, including the Finco Loans, and in turn, the Issuer’s ability to satisfy its obligations
under the Notes.

In addition, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the indentures governing the UPCH Notes

contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit UPC Holding’s ability to engage in activities that
may be in its long term best interests, including, among other things, borrowing additional funds. These
restrictions are subject to significant exceptions. UPC Holding’s failure to comply with such covenants could
result in an event of default under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and/or the UPCH Notes which, if
not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all UPC Holding’s debts or have a similar material
adverse effect on it.

UPC Holding may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in connection with any future

acquisition. In connection with its financial strategy, UPC Holding continually evaluates different financing
alternatives, and it may decide to enter into new credit facilities or incur other indebtedness from time to time,
including during the period following the consummation of this offering. If UPC Holding incurs new debt in
addition to its current debt, the related risks that it now faces, as described above and elsewhere in these
“Risk Factors”, could intensify.

**_UPC Holding’s substantial leverage could limit its ability to obtain additional financing and have other_**
**_adverse effects._**

UPC Holding seeks to maintain its debt at levels that provide for attractive returns without assuming undue

risk. In this regard, UPC Holding strives to cause its operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that
result in a consolidated debt balance that is between four and five times UPC Holding’s consolidated operating
cash flow (as defined in note 15 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
Offering Memorandum). At December 31, 2014, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Early 2015
Refinancings, the issuance of the Dollar Notes offered hereby, the issuance of the Euro Notes offered in the
Concurrent Euro Notes Offering, the funding of the Finco Loans and the application of the proceeds thereof, the
carrying amount of UPC Holding’s total third-party consolidated outstanding debt and capital lease obligations
would have been approximately €5.3 billion, of which €362.3 million is due over the next 12 months. UPC
Holding believes that it has sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of its debt and capital
lease obligations and to fund its foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as UPC
Holding’s debt maturities grow in later years, it anticipates that it will seek to refinance or otherwise extend its
debt maturities. No assurance can be given that UPC Holding would be able to refinance or otherwise extend its
debt maturities in light of current market conditions. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how economic
conditions, sovereign debt concerns and/or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets
UPC Holding accesses and, accordingly, UPC Holding’s future liquidity and financial position.

UPC Holding’s ability to service or refinance its debt and to maintain compliance with its leverage

covenants in the credit agreements and indentures of UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding is dependent
primarily on its ability to maintain or increase the operating cash flow of its operating subsidiaries and to achieve
adequate returns on its property and equipment additions and acquisitions. Accordingly, if UPC Holding’s cash
provided by operations declines or it encounters other material liquidity requirements, UPC Holding may be
required to seek additional debt financing in order to meet its debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as
they come due. In addition, UPC Holding’s ability to obtain additional debt financing to fund working capital
needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures, or other general corporate requirements is limited by the leverage
covenants contained in its and UPC Broadband Holding’s debt instruments. For example, if the operating cash

31


-----

flow of UPC Broadband Holding were to decline, UPC Holding could be required to partially repay or limit its
borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to maintain compliance with applicable
covenants. UPC Holding can give no assurance that any additional debt financing will be available on terms that
are as favorable as the terms of its existing debt or at all. UPC Holding’s ability to access available borrowings
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility can also be impacted by the interplay of average and spot
foreign currency rates with respect to leverage calculations under the indentures governing the UPC Holding
Senior Notes.

**_UPC Holding may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue_**
**_Date of the Notes, which indebtedness could increase its leverage and may have terms that are more or less_**
**_favorable than the terms of the Notes and UPC Holding’s other existing indebtedness._**

UPC Holding or its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a

refinancing of UPC Holding’s existing debt, to fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In
connection with UPC Holding’s financial strategy, UPC Holding continually evaluates different financing
alternatives, and UPC Holding may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or
incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation of this offering and prior to,
or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Notes. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will
be made at UPC Holding’s election or the election of its relevant subsidiaries, and if such debt is in the form of
securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering
memorandum. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or
incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes and UPC
Holding’s other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which
would have a corresponding effect on UPC Holding’s cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the
maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be
earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes and UPC Holding’s other existing debt. The other terms of
such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less
favorable than the terms of the Notes or UPC Holding’s other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance
that UPC Holding or its subsidiaries will elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such
debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount
or terms of any such additional debt. If UPC Holding incurs new debt in addition to its current debt, the related
risks that UPC Holding now faces, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in these
“Risk Factors”, could intensify.

**_UPC Holding may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet its debt service obligations._**

UPC Holding’s ability to meet its debt service obligations, including under the UPCH Notes or to refinance

its debt, depends on UPC Holding’s future operating and financial performance, which will be affected by its
ability to successfully implement its business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive,
regulatory and other factors beyond its control. If UPC Holding cannot generate sufficient cash to meet its debt
service requirements, UPC Holding may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of its debt, obtain
additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or investments or sell material assets.

If UPC Holding is not able to refinance any of its debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on

commercially reasonable terms or at all, UPC Holding may not be able to satisfy its debt obligations, including
the Finco Loans, and in turn, the Issuer may not be able to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. In that event,
borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions
may become payable on demand, and UPC Holding may not have sufficient funds to repay all of its debts,
including the Finco Loans, which would result in an inability of the Issuer to repay the Notes. See “Description
_of Other Indebtedness of UPC Holding”._

**_UPC Holding is subject to debt covenants that could adversely affect its ability to finance its future operations_**
**_and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

UPC Broadband Holding and its subsidiaries and UPC Financing are subject to the restrictive covenants

contained in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. These covenants restrict, in certain circumstances, the
ability of UPC Broadband Holding’s subsidiaries to, among other things, make any payments to UPC Financing
in order to enable it to make any payments on the Finco Loans, which will, in turn, affect the ability of the Issuer
to make payments under the Notes, repay any loans or advances to any such subsidiary or transfer any property
or assets to UPC Broadband Holding, UPC Financing or other subsidiaries of UPC Holding. The UPC Broadband

32


-----

Holding Bank Facility also requires UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing to maintain specified financial
ratios and satisfy financial tests which become more restrictive over the life of the facilities. The ability of
UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing to satisfy those financial tests can be affected by events beyond
their control, and there can be no assurance that they will satisfy them. In addition to customary default
provisions, including defaults on other indebtedness of UPC Broadband Holding and its subsidiaries, the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility provides that any event of default with respect to indebtedness of
€50.0 million or more in the aggregate of (i) LG Europe (the parent of Liberty Global Holding and an indirect
subsidiary of UGC), (ii) any other company of which UPC Broadband Holding is a subsidiary and which is a
subsidiary of LG Europe and (iii) UPC Holding II B.V. (a direct subsidiary of UPC Holding) is an event of
default under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. A breach of any of those covenants, ratios, tests or
restrictions could result in an event of default under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or hinder
UPC Broadband Holding’s or UPC Financing’s ability to borrow under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on UPC Broadband Holding’s and/or UPC Financing’s
ability to operate their business and to make payments under their debt instruments. Upon the occurrence of any
event of default under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the lenders thereunder could cancel the
availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. If UPC Broadband Holding and/or UPC
Financing were unable to repay those amounts, including amounts owing under the Finco Loans, the lenders
could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure repayment of those amounts. If the lenders under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility demand repayment of those amounts, there can be no assurance that the
assets of UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to
satisfy all of their other liabilities, which would be due and payable, and to make payments to enable them to
repay the Finco Loans which would, in turn, enable the Issuer to redeem the Notes in full or in part. Certain of
the limitations set forth above may change to the extent the UPC Broadband Bank Facility Amendments or other
proposed amendments are approved by the UCPB Lenders and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is so
amended. For a description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments, see “Description of the
_Notes—Finco Accession Agreements and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.”_

In addition, UPC Holding and its subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the

indentures governing the UPCH Notes. Each issue of the UPCH Notes are senior obligations that rank equally
with all of the existing and future senior debt and are senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of
UPC Holding. The UPCH Notes are secured by a pledge of the shares of UPC Holding. In addition, the UPCH
Notes provide that any failure to pay principal prior to expiration of any applicable grace period, or any
acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of €50.0 million or more in the aggregate of UPC Holding or its
Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indentures), including UPC Broadband Holding, is an event of default
under the UPCH Notes. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions in the UPCH Notes could result in an
event of default under the indentures governing the UPCH Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on
UPC Holding’s ability to operate its business and to make payments under its debt instruments. Upon the
occurrence of any event of default under the indentures governing the UPCH Notes, the holders of the UPCH
Notes could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures governing the UPCH Notes, together
with accrued interest, immediately due and payable subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. If UPC
Holding or its subsidiaries were unable to repay those amounts, the holders of the UPCH Notes could proceed
against the share pledge granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay

dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt. However, these covenants
could limit UPC Holding’s ability to finance its future operations and capital needs and its ability to pursue business
opportunities and activities that may be in its interest. In addition, UPC Holding’s ability to comply with the
provisions of the indentures governing the UPCH Notes may be affected by events beyond its control.

In addition to limiting UPC Holding’s flexibility in operating its business, the breach of any covenants or

obligations under the agreements governing its debt will result in a default under the applicable debt agreement
and could trigger acceleration of the related debt. Such a default or acceleration could in turn trigger defaults
under other agreements governing UPC Holding’s debt. A default under the agreements governing
UPC Holding’s other debt could materially adversely affect its growth, its financial condition and results of
operations and result in UPC Financing not having sufficient assets to make payments on the Finco Loans, and in
turn, result in the Issuer not having sufficient assets to make payments under the Notes. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness of UPC Holding”._

**_UPC Holding is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the debt service_**
**_obligations of UPC Holding._**

UPC Holding is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the UPC Broadband

Holding Bank Facility, which are indexed to EURIBOR, LIBOR, or other base rates. Although UPC Holding
enters into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no
assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all. If UPC Holding is unable to
effectively manage its interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market interest rates
would increase its interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks
associated with UPC Holding’s leveraged capital structure.

**_UPC Holding is subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect its_**
**_earnings._**

While UPC Holding’s operations attempt to increase its subscription rates to offset increases in

programming and operating costs, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so. Therefore, operating costs
may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on UPC Holding’s cash flow and
net earnings (loss). UPC Holding is also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other
administrative costs in certain of its markets.

**_UPC Holding is exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks._**

UPC Holding is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its debt in situations where

its debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows
support its ability to repay or refinance such debt. Although UPC Holding generally seeks to match the
denomination of its borrowings, and the borrowings of its subsidiaries, with the functional currency of the
operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause it to enter
into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations
(unmatched debt). In these cases, UPC Holding’s policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign
currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into
the applicable underlying currency.

UPC Holding is also exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the euro (its reporting

currency) against the currencies of its operating subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial
statements are translated into euro for inclusion in UPC Holding’s consolidated financial statements. Cumulative
translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) as a separate
component of owners’ deficit. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the euro against any foreign currency that
is the functional currency of one of UPC Holding’s operating subsidiaries or affiliates will cause it to experience
unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign
currencies. Accordingly, UPC Holding may experience a negative impact on its comprehensive earnings (loss)
and owners’ deficit with respect to its holdings solely as a result of foreign currency translation. UPC Holding’s
primary exposure to foreign currency risk from a foreign currency translation perspective is to the Swiss franc. In
addition, UPC Holding has significant exposure to changes in the exchange rates for the Polish zloty, the
Hungarian forint, the Romanian lei, the Czech koruna and other local currencies in Europe. UPC Holding
generally does not hedge against the risk that it may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial
statements of its subsidiaries and affiliates into euros.

**Risks Relating to UPC Holding’s Industry and Business**

**_UPC Holding operates in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that it will not be able to_**
**_effectively compete with other service providers._**

The markets for cable television, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services in many of

the regions in which UPC Holding operates are highly competitive. In the provision of video services
UPC Holding faces competition from digital terrestrial television (“DTT”) broadcasters, video provided over
satellite platforms, networks using digital subscriber line (“DSL”) technology, fiber-to-the-home/-building/-node
(“FTTx”) networks and, in some countries where parts of its systems are overbuilt, cable networks, among
others. UPC Holding’s operating businesses are facing increasing competition from video services provided by,
or over the networks of, incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers. As the availability
and speed of broadband internet increases, UPC Holding also faces competition from over-the-top video content
providers utilizing the high-speed internet connections of UPC Holding or its competitors. In the provision of
telephony and broadband internet services, UPC Holding is experiencing increasing competition from the
incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers in each country in which it operates, as well
as mobile providers of voice and data. The incumbent telecommunications operators typically dominate the
market for these services and have the advantage of nationwide networks and greater resources than
UPC Holding has to devote to the provision of these services. Many of the incumbent operators are now offering
double-play, triple-play and quadruple-play bundles of services. In many countries, UPC Holding also competes
with other operators using the unbundled local loop of the incumbent telecommunications operator to provide
these services, other facilities-based operators and wireless providers. Developments in the DSL and other
technology used by the incumbent telecommunications operators and alternative providers have improved the
attractiveness of UPC Holding’s competitor’s products and services and strengthened their competitive position.
Developments in wireless technology, such as long-term evolution (the next generation of ultra high-speed
mobile data), are creating additional competitive challenges.

In some of UPC Holding’s markets, national and local government agencies may seek to become involved,

either directly or indirectly, in the establishment of FTTx networks, DTT systems or other communications
systems. UPC Holding intends to pursue available options to restrict such involvement or to ensure that such
involvement is on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance, however, that UPC Holding will
be successful in these pursuits. As a result, UPC Holding may face competition from entities not requiring a
normal commercial return on their investments. In addition, UPC Holding may face more vigorous competition
than would have been the case if there were no government involvement.

UPC Holding expects the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing

competitors and new market entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory framework of the industries in which
UPC Holding operates, advances in technology, the influx of new market entrants and strategic alliances and
cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased competition could result in increased customer
churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and significant price competition
in most of its markets. In combination with difficult economic environments, these competitive pressures could
adversely impact UPC Holding’s ability to increase or, in certain cases, maintain the revenue, average monthly
subscription revenue per average RGU (ARPU), RGUs, operating cash flows, operating cash flow margins and
liquidity of its operating segments.

**_Continuing uncertainties and challenging conditions in the global economy and in the countries in which_**
**_UPC Holding operates may adversely impact UPC Holding’s business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets,

including the ongoing struggles in Europe related to sovereign debt issues, the risk of deflation and the stability
of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. Future developments are dependent
upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU Commission
to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the eurozone. As a result, we

35


-----

cannot predict how long challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets in which UPC
Holding operates may deteriorate. Additional risks arising from the ongoing economic challenges in Europe are
described below under “—UPC Holding is exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe
_that could have an adverse impact on its liquidity, financial condition and cash flows”._

Unfavorable economic conditions may impact a significant number of UPC Holding’s subscribers and/or the

prices UPC Holding is able to charge for its products and services, and, as a result, it may be (1) more difficult
for UPC Holding to attract new subscribers, (2) more likely that subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their
services and (3) more difficult for UPC Holding to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Countries may also seek
new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect UPC
Holding. Accordingly, UPC Holding’s ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs,
RGUs, operating cash flow, operating cash flow margins and liquidity of its operations could be adversely
affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to
predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.

**_UPC Holding may not report net earnings._**

UPC Holding reported net losses of €1,024.5 million, €726.6 million and €1,022.5 million during the years

ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In light of UPC Holding’s historical financial
performance and the impact of the Recent Transactions, it cannot assure you that it will report net earnings in the
near future or ever.

**_Changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for UPC Holding’s services._**

Technology in the video, telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including

advances in current technologies and the emergence of new technologies. New technologies, products and services
may impact consumer behavior and therefore demand for UPC Holding’s products and services. The ability to
anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and
services on a timely basis will affect UPC Holding’s ability to continue to grow, increase its revenue and number of
subscribers and remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not meet consumer expectations
or demand, can be subject to delays in development and may fail to operate as intended. A lack of market acceptance
of new products and services that UPC Holding may offer, or the development of significant competitive products or
services by others, could have a material adverse impact on its revenue and operating cash flow.

**_UPC Holding’s property and equipment additions may not generate a positive return._**

The video, broadband internet and telephony businesses in which UPC Holding operates are capital

intensive. Significant additions to UPC Holding’s property and equipment are required to add customers to its
networks and to upgrade or expand its broadband communications networks and upgrade customer premises
equipment to enhance its service offerings and improve the customer experience. These additions require
significant capital expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs. Significant competition, the
introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL
technologies, or adverse regulatory developments could cause UPC Holding to decide to undertake previously
unplanned upgrades of its networks and customer premises equipment in the impacted markets. In addition, no
assurance can be given that any future upgrades or extensions of its network will generate a positive return or
that UPC Holding will have adequate capital available to finance such future upgrades or extensions. If UPC
Holding is unable to, or elects not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding, extending
or upgrading its networks or making its other planned or unplanned additions to our property and equipment,
UPC Holding’s growth could be limited and its competitive position could be harmed.

**_UPC Holding depends almost exclusively on its relationships with third-party programming providers and_**
**_broadcasters for programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on_**
**_acceptable terms could adversely affect its business._**

The success of UPC Holding’s video subscription business depends, in large part, on its ability to provide a

wide selection of popular programming to its subscribers. UPC Holding generally does not produce its own content
and UPC Holding depends on its agreements, relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters
and collective rights associations to obtain such content. If UPC Holding fails to obtain a diverse array of popular
programming for its pay television services, including a sufficient selection of HD channels as well as non-linear
content (such as VoD and DVR capability), on satisfactory terms, UPC Holding may not be able to offer a

36


-----

compelling video product to its customers at a price they are willing to pay. Additionally, UPC Holding is
frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements and its annual costs for programming can vary.
There can be no assurance that UPC Holding will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of its programming
agreements on acceptable terms or at all. UPC Holding expects that programming and copyright costs will continue
to rise in future periods as a result of, among other factors, higher costs associated with the expansion of its digital
video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast
of live sporting events, and retransmission or copyright fees payable to public broadcasters.

If UPC Holding is unable to obtain or retain attractively priced competitive content, demand for its existing

and future television services could decrease, thereby limiting UPC Holding’s ability to attract new customers,
maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier programming,
thereby inhibiting its ability to execute its business plans. Furthermore, UPC Holding may not be able to obtain
attractive country-specific programming for video services. UPC Holding also may be placed at a competitive
disadvantage when its competitors offer exclusive programming. In addition, must carry requirements may
consume channel capacity otherwise available for other services. Any or all of these factors could result in
reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, UPC Holding’s digital video services.

**_UPC Holding depends on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and_**
**_certain services required for its businesses._**

UPC Holding relies on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that it requires in order

to provide services to its customers. UPC Holding’s suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability
to meet UPC Holding’s needs are subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, natural
calamities, interruptions in transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. As a result, UPC Holding may not
be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for its businesses on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in customer premises equipment could lead to delays in connecting customers to
its services, and accordingly, could adversely impact its ability to maintain or increase its RGUs, revenue and
cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers’ and licensors’ capacity or if they experience financial
difficulties, the ability of UPC Holding’s businesses to provide some services may be materially adversely
affected, which in turn could affect its businesses’ ability to attract and retain customers. Although UPC Holding
actively monitors the creditworthiness of its key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key
third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt UPC Holding’s operations and have an adverse impact on its
revenue and cash flows. Additionally, UPC Holding relies upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by
UPC Holding to use various technologies, conduct its operations and sell its products and services. Legal
challenges could be made against its use of its or its licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks,
patents and trade secrets) and UPC Holding may be required to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable
terms, incur monetary damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights in question.

**_UPC Holding’s businesses that offer mobile telephony and data services rely on the radio access networks of_**
**_third-party wireless network providers to carry its mobile communications traffic._**

UPC Holding’s services to mobile customers rely on the use of MVNO arrangements in which it utilizes the

radio access networks of third-party wireless network providers to carry its mobile communications traffic. If any
of UPC Holding’s MVNO arrangements are terminated, or if the respective third-party wireless network provider
fails to provide the services required under an MVNO arrangement, or if a third-party wireless network provider
fails to deploy and maintain its network, and UPC Holding is unable to find a replacement network operator on a
timely and commercial basis or at all, UPC Holding could be prevented from continuing the mobile services
relying on such MVNO arrangement. Additionally, as UPC Holding’s MVNO arrangements come to term, UPC
Holding may not be able to renegotiate renewal or replacement MVNO arrangements on the same or more
favorable terms.

Failure in UPC Holding’s technology or telecommunications systems or leakage of sensitive customer data

could significantly disrupt its operations, which could reduce its customer base and result in lost revenue.

UPC Holding’s success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of its information

technology and network systems as well as its customer service centers. The hardware supporting a large number
of critical systems for its cable network in a particular country or geographic region is housed in a relatively
small number of locations. UPC Holding’s systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including
telecommunications failures, power loss, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite security
measures, its servers and systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses,

37


-----

worms, phishing attacks and similar disruptive actions. Furthermore, UPC Holding’s operating activities could be
subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of
information maintained in its information technology systems and networks and those of UPC Holding’s thirdparty vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning
the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation
that has been adopted or is being considered across all of UPC Holding’s markets regarding the protection,
privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses
like UPC Holding that handle a large amount of personal customer data. Failure to comply with these data
protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines.

Despite the precautions UPC Holding has taken, unanticipated problems affecting its systems could cause

failures in UPC Holding’s information technology systems or disruption in the transmission of signals over its
networks or similar problems. Any disruptive situation that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of
data could damage UPC Holding’s reputation and the credibility of its operations. Further, sustained or repeated
system failures that interrupt UPC Holding’s ability to provide service to its customers or otherwise meet its
business obligations in a timely manner could adversely affect UPC Holding’s reputation and result in a loss of
customers and net revenue.

**_UPC Holding cannot be certain that it will be successful in acquiring new businesses or integrating acquired_**
**_businesses with its existing operations._**

Historically, UPC Holding’s businesses have grown, in part, through selective acquisitions that enabled

them to take advantage of existing networks, local service offerings and region-specific management expertise.
UPC Holding expects to seek to continue growing its businesses through acquisitions in selected markets. UPC
Holding’s ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing,
debt covenants, the prevalence of complex ownership structures among potential targets, government regulation
and competition from other potential acquirers, including private equity funds. Even if UPC Holding is
successful in acquiring new businesses, the integration of new businesses may present significant costs and
challenges, including: realizing economies of scale in interconnection, programming and network operations;
eliminating duplicative overheads; and integrating personnel, networks, financial systems and operational
systems. There can be no assurance that UPC Holding will be successful in acquiring new businesses or realizing
the anticipated benefits of any completed acquisition.

**_Strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions could disrupt our operations or make it more costly to_**
**_operate UPC Holding’s businesses._**

UPC Holding is exposed to the risk of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. In the future we

may experience lengthy consultations with labor unions and works councils or strikes, work stoppages or other
industrial actions. Strikes and other industrial actions, as well as the negotiation of new collective bargaining
agreements or salary increases in the future, could disrupt UPC Holding’s operations and make it more costly to
operate our facilities. In addition, strikes called by employees of any of UPC Holding’s key providers of
materials or services could result in interruptions the performance of UPC Holding’s services. The occurrence of
any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on UPC Holding’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Changes in value-added or similar revenue based tax rates could adversely affect UPC Holding’s cash flows._**

Most of UPC Holding’s revenue is derived from jurisdictions that administer value-added or similar

revenue-based taxes. Any increases in these taxes could have an adverse impact on UPC Holding’s ability to
maintain or increase its revenue to the extent that it is unable to pass such tax increases on to its customers. In the
case of revenue-based taxes for which it is the ultimate taxpayer, UPC Holding will also experience increases in
its operating expenses and corresponding declines in its operating cash flow and operating cash flow margins to
the extent of any such tax increases. Any additional future increases in value-added tax rates or similar revenue
based taxes could affect UPC Holding’s operating expenses and have an adverse impact on its cash flows.

**_Adverse decisions of tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on UPC Holding’s results of operations and cash flow._**

The tax laws and regulations in the countries in which UPC Holding operates may be subject to change and

there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, UPC Holding may face increases
in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in

38


-----

an adverse manner. In addition, the tax authorities in the countries in which UPC Holding operates may disagree
with the positions UPC Holding has taken or intends to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of
any of its transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, including the Notes,
existing and future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction of interest expenses. As a result, UPC
Holding may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by
the competent authorities in an adverse manner. UPC Holding regularly assesses the likelihood of such outcomes
and has established tax allowances, which represent management’s best estimate of the potential assessments. In
addition, UPC Holding and its subsidiaries are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many of the
jurisdictions in which UPC Holding operates. Although UPC Holding believes that its tax estimates are
reasonable, any material differences as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes, or the
resolution of any of these tax matters, could have a material adverse effect on UPC Holding’s cash flows,
business, financial condition and results of operations for any affected reporting period.

Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which UPC Holding operates could arise as a

result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project being undertaken by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries that
encompass most of the jurisdictions in which UPC Holding operates, is undertaking studies and publishing action
plans that include recommendations aimed at addressing what they believe are issues within tax systems that may
lead to tax avoidance by companies. It is possible that jurisdictions in which UPC Holding does business could
react to the BEPS initiative or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect UPC
Holding or its shareholders through increasing our tax liabilities.

**_UPC Holding is exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks in Europe that could have an adverse_**
**_impact on its liquidity, financial condition and cash flows._**

UPC Holding’s operations are subject to macro economic and political risks that are outside of its control.

For example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak
growth and high unemployment, could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt
restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility, and potentially,
disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact UPC Holding.
With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the eurozone with respect to individual macro
fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European
monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and
sovereign debt issues in individual eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of
one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in
these countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could
result in the redenomination of a portion, or in the extreme case, all of UPC Holding’s euro-denominated assets,
liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a
mismatch in the currencies of UPC Holding’s assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together
with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a
material adverse impact on UPC Holding’s liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination
event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the eurozone
countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for UPC Holding’s products, and accordingly,
on its revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies in countries in which
UPC Holding operates would require UPC Holding to modify its billing and other financial systems. No
assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow UPC
Holding to timely bill its customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant
exposure that UPC Holding has to the euro through its euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments,
cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on UPC Holding.

**_UPC Holding’s businesses are conducted in seven European countries, which gives rise to numerous_**
**_operational risks._**

UPC Holding’s businesses operate in seven European countries and are thereby subject to the following

inherent risks:

    - fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

    - difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

    - potentially adverse tax consequences;

    - export and import restrictions, custom duties, tariffs and other trade barriers;

39


-----

    - increases in taxes and governmental fees;

    - economic and political instability;

    - changes in foreign and domestic laws and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies;
and

    - operational risks that UPC Holding may experience in certain countries include disruptions of services
or loss of property or equipment that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation,
nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social or political unrest.

**Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters**

**_UPC Holding’s businesses are subject to risks of adverse regulation._**

UPC Holding’s businesses are subject to the unique regulatory regimes of the countries in which they

operate. Cable and telecommunications businesses are subject to licensing or registration eligibility rules and
regulations, which vary by country. The provision of electronic communications networks and services requires
licensing from, or registration with, the appropriate regulatory authorities and, for telephony services, entrance
into interconnection arrangements with other phone companies, including the incumbent phone company. It is
possible that countries in which UPC Holding operates may adopt laws and regulations regarding electronic
commerce, which could dampen the growth of the internet services being offered and developed by these
businesses. UPC Holding’s ability to increase the prices it charges for its cable television services or make
changes to the programming packages it offers is limited by regulation or conditions imposed by competition
authorities or is subject to review by regulatory authorities, is subject to termination rights of customers. In
addition, regulatory authorities may grant new licenses to third parties and, in any event, in most of UPC
Holding’s markets new entry is possible without a license, although there may be registration eligibility rules and
regulations, resulting in greater competition in territories where UPC Holding’s businesses may already be
active. More significantly, regulatory authorities may require UPC Holding to grant third parties access to its
bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell UPC Holding’s
services to end customers. Consequently, its businesses must adapt their ownership and organizational structure
as well as their pricing and service offerings to satisfy the rules and regulations to which they are subject. A
failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on such business or
loss of required licenses or other adverse conditions.

Adverse changes in rules and regulations could:

    - impair UPC Holding’s ability to use its bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue and
operating cash flow;

    - create a shortage of capacity on UPC Holding’s network, which could limit the types and variety of
services that it seeks to provide its customers;

    - strengthen UPC Holding’s competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into
UPC Holding’s markets; and

    - have a significant adverse impact on UPC Holding’s profitability.

Businesses, including UPC Holding, that offer multiple services, such as video distribution as well as

internet and telephony, or that are vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming
content, often face close regulatory scrutiny from competition authorities in several countries in which UPC
Holding operates. This is particularly the case with respect to any proposed business combinations, which will
often require clearance from national competition authorities. The regulatory authorities in several countries in
which UPC Holding does business have considered from time to time what access rights, if any, should be
afforded to third parties for use of existing cable television networks and have imposed access obligations in
certain countries. This has resulted, for example, in obligations with respect to call termination for UPC
Holding’s telephony business and video must carry obligations in many markets in which it operates.

When UPC Holding acquires additional communications companies, these acquisitions may require the

approval of governmental authorities (either at country or, in the case of the EU, European level), which can
block, impose conditions on, or delay an acquisition, thus hampering UPC Holding’s opportunities for growth. In
the event conditions are imposed and UPC Holding fails to meet them in a timely manner, the governmental
authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures,
such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations.

40


-----

**_New legislation may significantly alter the regulatory regime applicable to UPC Holding, which could_**
**_adversely affect UPC Holding’s competitive position and profitability, and UPC Holding may become subject_**
**_to more extensive regulation if it is deemed to possess significant market power in any of the markets in which_**
**_it operates._**

Significant changes to the existing regulatory regime applicable to the provision of cable television,

telephony and internet services have been and are still being introduced. For example, in the EU a large element
of regulation affecting UPC Holding’s business derives from a number of legal measures, which it refers to as
“Directives” and that are the basis of the regulatory regime concerning many of the services it offers across the
EU. The various Directives require Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover issues
such as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time
and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which UPC Holding’s businesses are
regulated and to which they would have to adapt. In addition, UPC Holding is subject to review by competition
or national regulatory authorities in certain countries concerning whether it exhibits significant market power. A
finding of significant market power could result in its becoming subject to pricing, open access, unbundling and
other requirements that could provide a more favorable operating environment for existing and potential
competitors.

**_UPC Holding does not have complete control over the prices that it charges._**

UPC Holding’s cable television business is in some countries subject to regulation or review by various

regulatory, competition or other government authorities responsible for the regulation or the review of the
charges to its subscribers for cable television services. Such authorities, in certain cases, could potentially require
UPC Holding to repay such fees to the extent they are excessive or discriminatory. UPC Holding also may not be
able to enforce future changes to its cable television subscription prices. Additionally, in certain European
markets, UPC Holding’s ability to bundle or discount its services may be constrained if it is held to be dominant
with respect to any product it offers. This may have an adverse impact on UPC Holding’s revenue, profitability
of new products and services and its ability to respond to changes in the cable television market.

**Risks Relating to UPC Holding’s Management, Principal Shareholders and Related Parties**

**_The loss of certain key personnel could harm UPC Holding’s business._**

UPC Holding has experienced employees at both the corporate and operational levels who possess

substantial knowledge of its business and operations. There can be no assurance that UPC Holding will be
successful in retaining the services of these employees or that it would be successful in hiring and training
suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could
cause significant disruptions in UPC Holding’s business operations, which could materially adversely affect its
results of operations.

**_The interests of Liberty Global, UPC Holding’s indirect parent company, may conflict with UPC Holding’s_**
**_interests._**

Liberty Global is UPC Holding’s parent, indirectly owning all of the voting interests in UPC Holding. When

business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation arise, the interests of Liberty Global (or other Liberty Global
controlled entities) may be different from, or in conflict with, UPC Holding’s interests on a stand-alone basis.
Because UPC Holding is indirectly controlled by the parent entity, Liberty Global may allocate certain or all of
its risks to UPC Holding and there can be no assurance that Liberty Global will permit UPC Holding to pursue
certain business opportunities.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure**

**_The Issuer is an unaffiliated special purpose financing company which will depend on payments under the_**
**_relevant Finco Loan to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the relevant series of Notes._**

The Issuer has been formed as a special purpose financing company for the primary purpose of facilitating

the offering of the Notes. The Issuer is a special purpose financing company that has no material business
operations, no direct subsidiaries and no employees and, upon completion of the offering of the Notes, its only
material assets will be the Finco Loans and its rights under certain related agreements. Furthermore, the
Indenture governing the Notes prohibits the Issuer from engaging in any activities other than certain limited
activities permitted under the heading “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitations with Respect

41


-----

_to Business Activities of the Issuer”. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent upon payments from UPC_
Financing under the Finco Loans, other than certain amounts due on the Notes (such as prepayment premiums
and additional amounts following certain tax events), which will be financed by UPC Financing pursuant to the
Fee Letter or by LG Europe pursuant to the Expenses Agreement, respectively, in order to service its obligations
under the Notes.

**_UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing conduct no business operations of their own. UPC Financing_**
**_will depend on payments from UPC Broadband Holding’s subsidiaries to make payments on the Finco Loans._**

UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing conduct no business operations of their own. The ability of

any of UPC Broadband Holding’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or
advances to UPC Broadband Holding depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory
or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject, and in some cases UPC Broadband
Holding’s receipt of such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Most of UPC
Broadband Holding’s operating subsidiaries are subject to credit agreements or indentures that restrict sales of
assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to
stockholders and partners, including UPC Broadband Holding. In addition, because these subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities they have no obligation to provide UPC Broadband Holding or UPC Financing
funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments, except to the extent
they are guarantors under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. If any of UPC Broadband Holding’s direct
or indirect subsidiaries are unable to make distributions or other payments to it or their respective parent entities,
UPC Financing does not expect to have any other sources of funds that would allow it to make payments under
the Finco Loans, and in turn, allow the Issuer to make payments under the Notes.

There can be no assurance that arrangements with UPC Broadband Holding’s subsidiaries and the funding

permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of UPC Broadband Holding’s
subsidiaries will provide UPC Financing with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments under
the Finco Loan, and in turn, fund payments by the Issuer under the Notes, when due.

**_Your ability to recover under the collateral securing the Notes may be limited._**

The holders of the Dollar Notes will benefit from security interests in the Collateral.

The Collateral securing the Dollar Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,

liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by any other creditors that also have the benefit of first liens on
the Collateral securing the Dollar Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Dollar Notes are
issued. Neither the Initial Purchasers nor the Trustee have either analyzed the effect of, or participated in any
negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of
any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral securing the Dollar Notes as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such
Collateral.

The security interest of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with

the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent
of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. The Issuer cannot assure you that the Security
Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. It also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will
be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have
the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its

priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens in the Collateral securing the
Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the
holders of the Dollar Notes if the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the
Indenture are not taken. For example, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after
the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain
proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Issuer has
limited obligations to perfect the noteholders’ security interest in specified collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the
Security Agent for the Dollar Notes will monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the
Trustee or the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that
the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral.

42


-----

Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent for the Notes has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of
additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest. Such failure may
result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the
Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes against third parties.

**_The security interest in the collateral securing the Dollar Finco Loan will not be granted directly to the_**
**_holders of the Dollar Notes._**

The security interests in the collateral securing the Dollar Finco Loan will not be granted directly to holders

of the Dollar Notes. Instead, they will be granted in favor of the security agent in respect of the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility, including the Dollar Finco Loan and the Dollar Finco Loan will in turn serve as collateral
for the obligations of the Issuer under the Dollar Notes.

As a result, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Dollar Notes, the Security Agent on behalf

of the Trustee and the holders of the Dollar Notes will not have the right to enforce the collateral for the Dollar
Finco Loan directly but, instead, must enforce the security interest in the Dollar Finco Loan and then enforce the
collateral granted in favor of the Dollar Finco Loan. This indirect claim over the collateral could delay or make
more costly any realization of such collateral.

**_By investing in the Dollar Notes you will have provided advanced consent to the UPC Broadband Holding_**
**_Bank Facility Amendments which will automatically become effective without any further consent from_**
**_holders of the Dollar Notes upon UPC Broadband Holding obtaining the consent of either the Majority_**
**_Lenders (as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility) or, with respect to certain amendments, all_**
**_UPCB Lenders._**

The Finco Accession Agreements contain the advance consent of the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, to the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments that UPC Broadband Holding may request in the future.
Accordingly, while the Issuer will have the same voting rights as the other UPCB Lenders in all matters under
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Issuer will have already provided its consent to any and all of the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments at the time it enters into the Finco Accession Agreements
and, therefore, it will not be entitled to vote on any future request for consent to the UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility Amendments. As a result, the holders of Notes will not, directly or indirectly, be entitled to direct
the vote of the Issuer on such matters and in the event UPC Broadband Holding solicits the consents for any or
all of these amendments to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or receive any consent fee or similar fee
that may be paid to other UPCB Lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in connection with
their approval of these amendments.

The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments include material modifications to certain

affirmative and negative covenants, financial maintenance covenants and related definitions, representations and
warranties, events of default, mandatory prepayment provisions and administrative provisions. The UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments are generally less restrictive and provide greater flexibility to the
UPC Holding and its subsidiaries than the provisions currently included in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility. Furthermore, pursuant to the Finco Accession Agreements, if and when the UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility Amendments come into effect, the Finco Loans will not benefit from the maintenance covenants
set forth in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. For a summary of the key amendments included in the
Senior Credit Facility Amendments, please see “Description of the Notes — Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
_— To the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or the Finco Accession Agreements.” Given the significant_
nature of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, you should read the terms of the Facility AL Finco
Accession Agreement, including the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments listed in schedule 3 of
the Finco AL Accession Agreement listed in Annex B of this Offering Memorandum in its entirety before
investing in the Notes.

The Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments also contain certain changes to the Control of Control

definition in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. To the extent these amendments are approved, the
Change of Control provision contained in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility will provide less protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including the sale of 50% or more of the issued share capital of
Liberty Global Europe Financing BV, the direct parent of UPC Holding, because such corporate events will no
longer constitute a Change of Control as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. See “Description
_of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”._

**_The security interests in the collateral securing the Dollar Finco Loan will be reduced to the extent the UPC_**
**_Broadband Holding Bank Facility Amendments are approved._**

The collateral securing the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility includes certain share and partnership

interests, inter-company loans, subordinated shareholder loans, bank accounts and inter-group receivables. See

43


-----

“Description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”. The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
Amendments approve the release of all security interests securing the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
other than security over the shares of any obligor of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, security over
loans from obligors to other members of the Borrower Group and any security required in respect of
Subordinated Shareholder Loans under the terms of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. As a result, the
amendment of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility based on the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
Amendments may result in the loss of certain security interests securing the Finco Loans.

**_Creditors under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the_**
**_collateral sold in any enforcement sale on a pari passu basis with the Dollar Finco Loan and the value of the_**
**_collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy UPC Financing’s obligations under the Dollar Finco Loan._**

The security granted in favor of the Finco Loans also secures all other indebtedness existing under the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility as a whole on a pari passu basis. In the event of a foreclosure on the liens
securing the Dollar Finco Loan, any proceeds received by the security agent in respect of the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility, as a whole, from the sale of the collateral would be distributed to repay on a pari passu
basis all of the creditors under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

No appraisals of any collateral securing the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility have been prepared in

connection with this offering. The value of such collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic
conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is
completed and the ability to readily liquidate the collateral. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity
of any arrangements governing creditors’ rights under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility could reduce
the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the collateral. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the
proceeds from the sale of the collateral will be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Dollar Finco Loan.
In addition, there can be no assurance that the collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all.

**_The potential UPC Exchange Transaction may be viewed as giving rise to a taxable event for holders of the_**
**_Dollar Notes that elect to participate in the exchange._**

The potential UPC Exchange Transaction, as generally described in this Offering Memorandum, may be

viewed as giving rise to a significant modification of the Dollar Notes, resulting in a taxable exchange for U.S.
federal income tax purposes upon the receipt of the UPC Qualified Notes. In such a case, U.S. Holders would
recognize gain or loss on the amount realized with respect to the exchange. Additionally, U.S. Holders may be
treated as acquiring the UPC Qualified Notes with original issue discount and may be required to accrue original
issue discount following the exchange. For additional discussion of this matter, see “Certain U.S. Federal Income
_Tax Considerations—Possible Effect of the UPC Exchange Transaction”. Holders should consult their tax_
advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the potential UPC Exchange Transaction in their respective
tax jurisdictions.

**_The Dollar Notes may be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax

purposes. An obligation generally is treated as having been issued with original issue discount if its stated
redemption price at maturity exceeds its issue price by at least a defined de minimis amount. If a Dollar Note is
treated as issued with original issue discount, U.S. investors will be subject to tax on that original issue discount as
ordinary income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to that income (and in addition
to qualified stated interest). See “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Dollar Notes. The ratings

may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Dollar Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any
time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a
credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating

44


-----

assigned to the Dollar Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms
and conditions of the Issuer’s financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Dollar Notes.

**_UPC Financing and UPC Broadband Holding may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance_**
**_required prepayments of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (including prepayment of the Finco_**
**_Loans) in the event of a change of control thereunder._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility) and

if the majority lenders thereunder so require, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing will be required to
prepay the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (including the Finco Loans) and to pay any premiums or other
amounts that may be due under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, including a payment equal to 1% of
the principal amount of the Finco Loans, as required under the Finco Accession Agreements. The ability of UPC
Broadband Holding and UPC Financing to prepay the Finco Loans upon a Change of Control would be limited
by their access to funds at the time of the prepayment and the terms of their other debt agreements, which
agreements could restrict or prohibit such a prepayment. Upon a Change of Control, UPC Broadband Holding
and UPC Financing may be required immediately to repay the outstanding principal, any accrued interest on and
any other amounts owed by them under one or more of their other bank facilities. The source of funds for these
repayments would be their available cash or cash generated from other sources. However, there can be no
assurance that UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing will have sufficient funds available upon a Change
of Control to make these repayments. If they are not able to make the required prepayment of the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility (including the Finco Loans), the Issuer will not be able to redeem the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes have limited recourse to the Issuer, as payments under the Notes are limited to the_**
**_amount of certain payments received by the Issuer under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the_**
**_related agreements._**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents (as defined

under “Description of the Notes”) will be limited as set forth in the Indenture. All payments to be made by the
Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents will be made only from and to the extent
of such sums received or recovered by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Trustee or the security agent under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Finco Accession Agreements, the Fee Letter, the Deed of Covenant and
the Expenses Agreement, and other than under the limited circumstances described below under “Description of
_the Notes—Events of Default and Remedies”, none of the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the_
Registrar or the holders of Notes will have any further recourse to the Issuer in respect thereof in the event that
the amount due and payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Security Documents
exceeds the amounts so received under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Finco Accession
Agreements, the Fee Letter, the Deed of Covenant and the Expenses Agreement.

The Trustee and the holders of the Notes will not be permitted to take any action, commence any proceeding

or petition a court for the liquidation of the Issuer, nor will they be permitted to enter into any arrangement,
reorganization or insolvency proceeding in relation to the Issuer, whether under the laws of the Cayman Islands
or other applicable bankruptcy laws. The obligations of the Issuer are solely obligations of the Issuer, and the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes will not have any recourse against any of the directors, officers or
employees (if any) of the Issuer for any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, indemnities or other obligations
whatsoever in connection with any transactions contemplated by the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents
and the related documents. Having realized the collateral securing the Notes and distributed the net proceeds
thereof, in each case in accordance with the Indenture, none of the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent,
the Registrar and the holders of the Notes may take any further steps to recover any sum still unpaid in respect of
the Notes, the Indenture or any of the Notes Security Documents or otherwise and all claims against the Issuer in
respect of any such sum due but still unpaid shall be extinguished.

**_Holders of the Notes have limited direct recourse to UPC Financing._**

Except for the specific interests of the Issuer as a UPCB Lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank

Facility or as otherwise expressly provided in the terms of the Indenture, no proprietary or other direct interest in
the Issuer’s rights under or in respect of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility exists for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes. Further, subject to the terms of the Indenture, no holder of Notes can enforce any provision
of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or have direct recourse to UPC Financing as borrower except
through an action by the Trustee or the Security Agent pursuant to the rights granted to the Trustee and Security
Agent under the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents. Under the Indenture, the Trustee shall not be

45


-----

required to take proceedings to enforce payment under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility unless it has
been indemnified or secured by the holders of the Notes to its satisfaction. In addition, neither the Issuer nor the
Trustee is required to monitor UPC Financing’s financial performance.

**_United States securities laws restrict the circumstances under which you can transfer the Dollar Notes._**

The Issuer is offering the Dollar Notes in reliance upon exemptions from registration under the U.S.

Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, the Dollar Notes may be transferred or resold only
in transactions registered under, exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act and all applicable state securities laws. In addition, transfer restrictions with respect to the Dollar Notes
which relate to exceptions provided for under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, prohibit
transfer except as provided by the transfer restrictions under “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions”.
You should read the discussions under “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions” for further information
about these and other transfer restrictions. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of Dollar
Notes comply with applicable law.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Dollar Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Dollar_**
**_Notes will be limited._**

The Dollar Notes will be new securities for which there is no market. The Issuer cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Dollar Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Dollar Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Dollar Notes.

Future trading prices of the Dollar Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,

prevailing interest rates, UPC Holding’s operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility
in the prices of securities similar to the Dollar Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Dollar Notes may
be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that
may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Dollar Notes will be subject to disruptions.
Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Dollar Notes, regardless of UPC Holding’s
prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers of the Dollar Notes have advised the Issuer that they
currently intend to make a market in the Dollar Notes. However, the Dollar Initial Purchasers are not obliged to
do so, and they may discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice. As a result, there is no
assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Dollar Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your Dollar Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Dollar Notes

listed and admitted to the Official List and trading on the Global Exchange Market of the Irish Stock Exchange
within a reasonable period after the Issue Date of the Notes and to maintain such listing as long as the Dollar
Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Dollar Notes will become or remain listed. If the
Issuer can no longer maintain the listing on the Irish Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make
or maintain such listing (for the avoidance of doubt, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards or any accounting standard other than U.S. GAAP and any other
standard pursuant to which the Issuer prepares its financial statements shall be deemed unduly burdensome), the
Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Irish Stock Exchange, provided that it will use
reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Dollar Notes on another stock exchange although
there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity
of the Dollar Notes as a result of listing on the Irish Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for
high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Dollar
Notes from the Irish Stock Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a
material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Dollar Notes in the secondary market.

**_The various insolvency and administrative laws to which UPC Holding and the Issuer are subject may not be_**
**_favorable to creditors, including the Issuer as lender under the Finco Loans and holders of Notes, as the case_**
**_may be, and may limit the Issuer’s ability to enforce its rights under the Finco Loans and your ability to_**
**_enforce your rights under the Notes._**

_The Netherlands and the EU_

UPC Holding, UPC Broadband Holding and certain of their respective subsidiaries are organized under the

laws of the Netherlands and have their center of main interests within the meaning of the EU Insolvency
Regulation (EU 1346/2000) in the Netherlands (the “Dutch Companies”). Consequently, in the event of a
bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to a Dutch Company, primary proceedings would likely be initiated
in the Netherlands while secondary proceedings could be initiated in one or more EU jurisdictions (with the
exception of Denmark) in which UPC Holding or UPC Broadband Holding, as the case may be, conducts
operations. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise
may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding enforcement of your rights. The Issuer’s rights as a lender
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, and indirectly your rights as a holder of Notes, may be subject
to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions that may differ substantially from each other,
including with regard to the rights of creditors, priority claims and procedures and may contain provisions that
are unfavorable to you. For example in some jurisdictions:

    - after the occurrence of an insolvency event, secured lenders with a first ranking priority have additional
rights, including, among other things, the right to direct the disposition of any collateral security, which
could result in the sale of certain assets for less than their going concern value, whereas in other
jurisdictions a secured creditor may be stayed from taking any enforcement action for an indeterminate
period of time;

    - certain claims, such as (i) amounts owed in respect of occupational pension schemes, (ii) certain
amounts owed to employees, (iii) amounts owed to governmental entities and (iv) expenses of an
insolvency trustee or administrator may have priority over claims of unsecured creditors, including
secured creditors to the extent the collateral is insufficient;

    - the grant of collateral security for the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, including the Finco
Loans underlying the Notes, may be voided if entered into or granted within specified hardening
periods in advance of an insolvency event and/or if this is found to be detrimental to the creditors; and

    - the ability to claim for or collect interest or other amounts accruing after the commencement of
bankruptcy proceedings may be limited and may not be entitled to priority.

In addition, although the EU Insolvency Regulation does provide guidance, there can be no assurance as to

how these laws would be applied in the event of a multi-jurisdictional insolvency proceeding. As a result, UPC
Holding and UPC Broadband Holding cannot assure you that the Trustee and/or Security Agent will be able to
enforce the Issuer’s rights as a creditor effectively in such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.

Dutch insolvency laws may make it difficult or impossible to effect a restructuring. There are two primary

insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payment (surséance van betaling), is intended to
facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second,
bankruptcy (faillissement), is designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors.

Upon commencement of moratorium of payment proceedings, the court will grant a provisional

moratorium. A definitive moratorium will generally be granted in a creditors’ meeting called for that purpose,
unless rejected by a qualified minority of the general unsecured non-preferential creditors. In both cases, general
unsecured and non-preferential creditors will be precluded from attempting to recover their claims from the
assets of the debtor. Moratorium is subject to exceptions, the most important of which excludes secured creditors
and preferential creditors (such as tax and social security authorities) from the application of the moratorium.
During Dutch moratorium of payment proceedings, secured creditors may proceed against the assets that secure
their claims to satisfy their claims, and preferential creditors are also not barred from seeking to recover their
claims. A recovery under Dutch law, therefore, could involve a sale of assets in a manner that does not reflect the
going concern value of the debtor. In a moratorium, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to the unsecured
and non-preferential creditors. Such a composition will be binding upon all unsecured and non-preferential
creditors, irrespective whether they voted in favor or against it or whether they were represented at the creditor’s
meeting called for the purpose of voting on the composition plan, if (i) it is approved by more than 50% in
number of the general unsecured and non-preferential creditors present or represented at the creditor’s meeting,
representing at least 50% in amount of the general unsecured and non-preferential claims admitted for voting

47


-----

purposes and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the Court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws
could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring of UPC Holding or UPC
Broadband Holding, as the case may be, and could reduce the holders’ recovery in a Dutch insolvency
proceeding.

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds

distributed to the debtor’s creditors on a pari passu basis and certain creditors (such as secured creditors and
preferential creditors) will have special rights that may adversely affect the interests of the Issuer as a lender
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date
the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of the Issuer as a lender under
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility which were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a
bankruptcy are admissible only for their net present value if they mature more than one year after opening of the
bankruptcy. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the receiver to be verified by the receiver.
“Verification” under Dutch law means that the receiver verifies the value of the claim and whether and to what
extent it may be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have
been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceedings may be based on the net present value analysis. Creditors
that wish to dispute the valuation of their claims by the receiver will need to commence a court proceeding.
These verification procedures could cause holders of the Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their
Notes.

In a bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to the unsecured and non-preferential creditors.

Such a composition will be binding upon all unsecured and non-preferential creditors, if (i) it is approved by a
simple majority of the meeting of the recognized and admitted creditors representing at least 50% of the amount
of the recognized and of the admitted claims and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the Court.

_The Cayman Islands_

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The insolvency laws of the Cayman

Islands are likely to differ from those of the United States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar.
The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the Cayman Islands. In the event that
the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or
similar proceedings.

Under Cayman Islands law, insolvency proceedings involve the appointment of a liquidator whose function

it is to act as the agent of the company and (i) to realize the company’s unsecured assets; (ii) to identify the
company’s unsecured creditors and the amounts of their claims; and (iii) to distribute the proceeds of realization
of the company’s unsecured assets (net of expenses and claims of preferred creditors) to the company’s
unsecured creditors pro rata, and after the creditors have been paid in full to the company’s shareholders.
Cayman Islands legislation provides for three different procedural systems for winding-up companies, namely
(i) compulsory winding-up by order of the Cayman Island Court (the “Court”), (ii) voluntary winding-up initiated
by a resolution of the shareholders or in accordance with the provisions of the company’s articles of association,
and (iii) voluntary winding-up originally initiated by a resolution of the shareholders that is subsequently made
subject to the supervision of the Court. A petition to the Court for a winding up order may be made by the
company itself or a creditor (including a contingent or prospective creditor) or shareholder of the company. A
winding up order is usually sought by demonstrating to the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts, or
because it is otherwise just and equitable to make a winding-up order. When considering inability to pay debts,
Cayman Islands law emphasizes a company’s cash-flow position although the net asset position of the company
may also be taken into account by the Court. When a winding up order is made by the Court, an automatic
moratorium on proceedings against the company is imposed and proceedings may not be commenced or
continued against the company except with the express permission of the Court. Dispositions of property,
transfers of shares and alterations in the status of shareholders are void unless approved by the Court. The
moratorium does not affect any valid rights to set off or subordination agreements acquired or entered into before
the commencement of the liquidation. A secured creditor is entitled to enforce his security without the leave of
the Court and without reference to the liquidator.

It is a rule of Cayman Islands insolvency law that all ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors are

treated equally irrespective of the nature of their claims. This is referred to as the pari passu rule. Local creditors
(save in certain cases for a minimal category of statutorily preferred creditors including statutory fees, and very
limited amounts owed to Cayman Islands employees) do not have any preference or priority over foreign
creditors. This rule applies among ordinary unsecured and unsubordinated creditors existing as of the

48


-----

commencement of the liquidation or whose claims arise out of causes or action that accrued before the date of the
commencement of the liquidation. These will include creditors whose claims against the company arise out of
contract, common law and statutory torts, equitable claims, etc.

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and does not have any assets in the United

States. It is anticipated that some or all of the directors and officers of the Issuer will be non-residents of the
United States and that all or a majority of their assets will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or its respective
directors and officers, or to enforce any judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability
provisions of the U.S. securities laws. In addition, the Issuer cannot assure you that civil liabilities predicated
upon the federal securities laws of the United States will be enforceable in the Cayman Islands. See
“Enforcement of Judgments”.

**_Employee Benefit Plan Considerations._**

Each acquirer and each transferee of a Note or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented,

warranted and agreed at the time of its acquisition and throughout the period that it holds such Note or any
interest therein that (i) either (a) it is not, and is not acting on behalf of (and for so long as such acquirer or
transferee holds such Note or any interest therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), a Benefit Plan
Investor (as defined under “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”) or a governmental, church or nonU.S. plan which is subject to any Similar Laws (as defined under “Certain Employee Benefit Plan
_Considerations”), and no part of the assets used by it to acquire or hold any Note or any interest therein_
constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or any such governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, or (b) its
acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note, or any interest therein, does not and will not constitute or
otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA (as defined under “Certain
_Employee Benefit Plan Considerations”) and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a governmental,_
church or non U.S. plan, a non-exempt violation of any Similar Laws); and (ii) neither the Issuer nor any of its
affiliates is a fiduciary (within the meaning of section 3(21) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or, with
respect to a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any definition of “fiduciary” under Similar Laws with
respect to the acquirer or transferee in connection with any purchase or holding of the Notes, or as a result of any
exercise by the Issuer or any of its affiliates of any rights in connection with the Notes, and no advice provided
by the Issuer or any of its affiliates has formed a primary basis for any investment decision by or on behalf of the
acquirer or transferee in connection with the Notes and the transactions contemplated with respect to the Notes.
See “Certain Employee Benefit Plan Considerations” herein for a more detailed discussion of certain ERISA and
related considerations with respect to an investment in the Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The Issuer expects that the net proceeds from the sale of the Dollar Notes offered hereby and the Euro Notes

offered in the Concurrent Euro Note Offering, together with the fees payable to the Issuer by UPC Financing
under the Fee Letter, as described below, will be €1,150.4 million (equivalent). The Issuer will use the net
proceeds of the issuance of the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes, together with the fees payable to it by UPC
Financing under the Fee Letter, as described below, to fund the Euro Finco Loan and the Dollar Finco Loan,
respectively, with the Euro Finco Loan denominated in euro and the Dollar Finco Loan denominated in U.S.
dollars, in aggregate principal amounts equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes and Dollar
Notes, respectively, under two new additional facilities (Facility AK and Facility AL, respectively) borrowed by
UPC Financing under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. The gross proceeds of the Finco Loans are
intended to be used for the Refinancing, to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and for general
corporate purposes, which may include loans, distributions or other payments to UPC Holding and its direct or
indirect parent companies. The Initial Purchasers’ commissions and certain estimated expenses incurred in
connection with this offering are expected to be approximately €17.4 million, including legal, accounting and
other professional fees incurred in connection therewith. An amount equal to such commissions and expenses on
the Notes, will be paid by UPC Financing to the Issuer as part of the fees payable by UPC Financing to the Issuer
under the Fee Letter. As UPC Holding will consolidate the Issuer following the issuance of the Notes, the Finco
Loans and UPC Financing’s payment of the upfront fee to the Issuer will be eliminated in consolidation. For a
description of the Fee Letter, see “Description of the Notes—Certain Transaction Documents”.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**

**OPERATIONS OF UPC HOLDING**

The following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in providing an understanding of our financial

condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements. This discussion is organized as follows:

    - _Overview. This section provides a general description of our business and recent events._

    - _Results of Operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the years ended_
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

    - _Liquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our corporate and subsidiary_
liquidity, consolidated statements of cash flows and contractual commitments.

    - _Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates. This section discusses those material_
accounting policies that contain uncertainties and require significant judgment in their application.

The capitalized terms used below have been defined in the notes to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated

Financial Statements. In the following text, the terms “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the
context requires, to UPC Holding or collectively to UPC Holding and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into euros are calculated, and operational data

(including subscriber statistics) are presented, as of December 31, 2014.

**Overview**

We are an international provider of (i) video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in nine

European countries and (ii) mobile services in five European countries. We also provide DTH services to
customers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through UPC DTH.

As further described in note 1 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed

the VTR Extraction in January 2014. We have accounted for the VTR Extraction as a common control transfer.
As a result, all financial and operating information has been retrospectively revised to give effect to the VTR
Extraction for all periods presented. For information regarding certain other reporting entity changes that were
completed subsequent to December 31, 2014, see note 16 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Our analog cable service offerings include basic programming and, in some markets, expanded basic

programming. We tailor both our basic channel line-up and our additional channel offerings to each system
according to culture, demographics, programming preferences and local regulation. Our digital cable service
offerings include basic and premium programming and incremental product and service offerings such as
enhanced pay-per-view programming (including video-on-demand), digital video recorders and high definition
programming.

We have launched “Horizon TV” in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Ireland and cloud-based Horizon TV

in Poland. Horizon TV is a family of media products that allows customers to view and share content across the
television, computer, tablet and smartphone. Horizon TV is powered by a user interface that provides customers a
seamless intuitive way to access linear, time-shifted, on-demand and web-based content on the television. It also
features an advanced set-top box that delivers not only video, but also internet and voice connections along with
a wireless network for the home. For our Horizon TV customers, we also offer applications for various services.
We are expanding the Horizon TV experience through cloud TV, including cloud digital video recorders, videoon-demand navigation and advanced applications. In November 2014, we launched this cloud-based Horizon TV
platform in select areas in Poland, followed by a full commercial launch in January 2015. In addition, we have
launched our subscriber-video-on-demand offering, which we refer to as “MyPrime”. MyPrime is a subscriptionbased on-demand video library that allows customers to choose from several thousand classic films, children’s
programs, series and documentaries. We have launched MyPrime in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Poland and
Hungary. We intend to (i) expand the availability of Horizon TV and MyPrime to other markets within our
footprint and (ii) continue to improve the Horizon TV user experience with new functionality and software
updates.

Although our digital television signals are encrypted in many of the countries in which we operate, our basic

digital television channels in Switzerland, Austria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands are

53


-----

unencrypted. Where our basic digital television channels are unencrypted, subscribers who have the necessary
equipment and who pay the monthly subscription fee for our analog package are able to watch our basic digital
television channels. Regardless of whether basic digital television channels are offered on an unencrypted basis,
expanded channel packages and premium channels and services continue to be available for an incremental
monthly fee in all of our markets. In markets where we introduce unencryption, we generally expect to
experience a positive impact on our subscriber disconnect levels and a somewhat negative impact on demand for
lower tiers of digital cable services.

We offer broadband internet services in all of our broadband communications markets. Our residential

subscribers generally access the internet at various download speeds ranging up to 250 Mbps (500 Mbps in
limited areas), depending on the market and the tier of service selected. We determine pricing for each tier of
broadband internet service through analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors.

We offer fixed-line telephony services in all of our broadband communications markets, primarily using

voice-over-internet-protocol technology. In addition, we offer mobile services using third-party networks in
Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria.

We have completed a number of transactions that somewhat impact the comparability of our 2014 and 2013

results of operations.

We strive to achieve organic revenue and customer growth in our operations by developing and marketing

bundled entertainment and information and communications services, and extending and upgrading the quality of
our networks where appropriate. As we use the term, organic growth excludes foreign currency translation effects
(FX) and the estimated impact of acquisitions. While we seek to obtain new customers, we also seek to maximize
the average revenue we receive from each household by increasing the penetration of our digital cable,
broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services with existing customers through product bundling
and upselling.

At December 31, 2014, we owned and operated networks that passed 15,874,600 homes and served

16,985,700 revenue generating units (RGUs), consisting of 7,997,000 video subscribers, 5,215,000 broadband
internet subscribers and 3,773,700 fixed-line telephony subscribers.

Including the effects of acquisitions, we added a total of 401,100 RGUs during 2014. Excluding the effects

of acquisitions (RGUs added on the acquisition date), but including post-acquisition date RGU additions, we
added 324,100 RGUs on an organic basis during 2014. The organic RGU growth during 2014 is attributable to
the growth of our (i) broadband internet services, which added 310,600 RGUs, (ii) digital cable services, which
added 259,700 RGUs and (iii) fixed-line telephony services, which added 197,200 RGUs. The growth of our
broadband internet, digital cable and fixed-line telephony services was partially offset by a decline in our analog
cable RGUs of 439,500 and a less significant decline in our multi-channel multi-point (microwave) distribution
system (MMDS) video RGUs.

We are experiencing significant competition from incumbent telecommunications operators (particularly in

the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland, where the incumbent telecommunications operators are
overbuilding our networks with fiber-to-the-home, -cabinet, -building or -node (referred to herein as FTTx) and
advanced digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies), DTH operators and/or other providers in all of our
broadband communications markets. This significant competition, together with the maturation of certain of our
markets, has contributed to organic declines in certain of our markets in revenue, RGUs and/or average monthly
subscription revenue per average RGU (ARPU), the more notable of which include:

(i) an organic decline in overall revenue in the Netherlands during the fourth quarter of 2014, as compared
to the fourth quarter of 2013;

(ii) organic declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 in (a) video RGUs in the majority of our markets, as

net declines in our analog cable RGUs generally exceeded net additions to our digital cable RGUs
(including migrations from analog cable) in these markets, (b) fixed-line telephony RGUs in the
Netherlands and (c) total RGUs in the Netherlands and Switzerland; and

(iii) organic declines in overall cable ARPU in the majority of our markets during the fourth quarter of

2014, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.

In addition to competition, our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside

of our control. For example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several European countries in which we

54


-----

operate, combined with weak growth and high unemployment, could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity
measures), tax increases, sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk,
high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes
that might adversely impact our company. Given our significant exposure to the euro, the occurrence of any of
these events within the eurozone countries could have an adverse impact on, among other matters, our liquidity
and cash flows.

The video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony businesses in which we operate are capital intensive.

Significant additions to our property and equipment are required to add customers to our networks and to upgrade
our broadband communications networks and customer premises equipment to enhance our service offerings and
improve the customer experience, including expenditures for equipment and labor costs. Significant competition,
the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies such as FTTx and advanced DSL
technologies, or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to undertake previously unplanned
upgrades of our networks and customer premises equipment in impacted markets. In addition, no assurance can
be given that any future upgrades will generate a positive return or that we will have adequate capital available to
finance such future upgrades. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new
customers, expanding or upgrading our networks or making our other planned or unplanned additions to our
property and equipment, our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be harmed. For
information regarding our property and equipment additions, see Liquidity and Capital Resources —
_Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below._

We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide

services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is
subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in
transportation systems, terrorism and labor issues. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment,
software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in
customer premises equipment could lead to delays in connecting customers to our services, and accordingly,
could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our RGUs, revenue and cash flows.

**Results of Operations**

As noted under Overview above, the comparability of our operating results during 2014, 2013 and 2012 is

affected by acquisitions. In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impact of acquisitions on our
operating results. The acquisition impact represents our estimate of the difference between the operating results
of the periods under comparison that is attributable to an acquisition. In general, we base our estimate of the
acquisition impact on an acquired entity’s operating results during the first three months following the
acquisition date such that changes from those operating results in subsequent periods are considered to be organic
changes. Accordingly, in the following discussion, variances attributed to an acquired entity during the first
twelve months following the acquisition date represent differences between the estimated acquisition impact and
the actual results.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our reported operating results as

certain of our operating segments have functional currencies other than the euro. Our primary exposure to FX
risk during 2014 was to the Swiss franc and other local currencies in Europe. In this regard, 52.1% of our euro
revenue during the three months ended December 31, 2014 was derived from subsidiaries whose functional
currency is other than the euro. The portions of the changes in the various components of our results of
operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted under Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable
_Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results below._

**Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments**

**_General_**

All of the reportable segments set forth below derive their revenue primarily from broadband

communications services, including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services. All of our
reportable segments also provide B2B services, and certain of our reportable segments provide mobile services.
For detailed information regarding the composition of our reportable segments, including information regarding
certain changes to our reportable segments that we made during the fourth quarter of 2014, see note 15 to the
December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

The tables presented below in this section provide a separate analysis of each of the line items that comprise

operating cash flow (revenue, operating expenses and SG&A expenses, excluding share-based compensation

55


-----

expense, as further discussed in note 15 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements) as well as
an analysis of operating cash flow by reportable segment for (i) 2014, as compared to 2013, and (ii) 2013, as
compared to 2012. These tables present (i) the amounts reported by each of our reportable segments for the
comparative periods, (ii) the euro change and percentage change from period to period and (iii) the organic
percentage change from period to period (percentage change after removing FX and the estimated impacts of
acquisitions). The comparisons that exclude FX assume that exchange rates remained constant at the prior year
rate during the comparative periods that are included in each table. We also provide a table showing the
operating cash flow margins of our reportable segments for 2014, 2013 and 2012 at the end of this section.

The revenue of our reportable segments includes revenue earned from (i) subscribers to our broadband

communications and mobile services and (ii) B2B services, interconnect fees, installation fees, channel carriage
fees, late fees and advertising. Consistent with the presentation of our revenue categories in note 15 to the
December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements, we use the term “subscription revenue” in the following
discussion to refer to amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding installation fees and late
fees. In the following tables, mobile subscription revenue excludes the related interconnect revenue.

Most of our revenue is derived from jurisdictions that administer VAT or similar revenue-based taxes. Any

increases in these taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue to the
extent that we are unable to pass such tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenue-based taxes for
which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience increases in our operating expenses and
corresponding declines in our operating cash flow and operating cash flow margins to the extent of any such tax
increases. In this regard, certain changes regarding VAT took effect on January 1, 2015, including a change in
how VAT is calculated with respect to the operations of UPC DTH in Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia. As compared to 2014 levels, this change is expected to result in an increase in UPC DTH’s annual
VAT payments during 2015 ranging from approximately €12 million to €14 million.

We pay interconnection fees to other telephony providers when calls or text messages from our subscribers

terminate on another network, and we receive similar fees from such providers when calls or text messages from
their customers terminate on our networks or networks that we access through MVNO or other arrangements.
The amounts we charge and incur with respect to fixed-line telephony and mobile interconnection fees are
subject to regulatory oversight in many of our markets. To the extent that regulatory authorities introduce fixedline or mobile termination rate changes we would experience prospective changes in our interconnect revenue
and costs. The ultimate impact of any such changes in termination rates on our operating cash flow would be
dependent on the call or text messaging patterns that are subject to the changed termination rates.

_General. While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in the revenue of our_

reportable segments, we are experiencing significant competition in all of our broadband communications
markets. This competition has an adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our RGUs and/or ARPU.
For a description of the more notable recent impacts of this competition on our broadband communications
markets, see Overview above.

(a) The increase in Switzerland/Austria’s cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number
of RGUs is attributable to increases in the average numbers of broadband internet, digital cable and fixedline telephony RGUs in each of Switzerland and Austria that were largely offset by a decline in the average
number of analog cable RGUs in each of Switzerland and Austria.

(b) The increase in Switzerland/Austria’s cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due to an
increase in Switzerland that was only partially offset by a decrease in Austria. The increase in Switzerland is
primarily due to (i) an improvement in RGU mix and (ii) a net increase primarily resulting from the
following factors: (a) higher ARPU due to the inclusion of higher-priced tiers of fixed-line telephony and
broadband internet services in Switzerland’s bundles, including the impact of price increases in April 2014
and January 2014, (b) lower ARPU due to a decrease in fixed-line telephony call volumes and (c) lower
ARPU due to the impact of higher bundling discounts. The decrease in Austria is primarily due to (1) a net
decrease resulting from the following factors: (A) higher ARPU due to a January 2014 price increase for
video services, (B) lower ARPU due to the impact of an increase in the proportion of subscribers receiving
lower-priced tiers of digital cable and fixed-line telephony services in Austria’s bundles, (C) lower ARPU
due to the impact of higher bundling discounts and (D) lower ARPU due to a decrease in fixed-line
telephony call volumes and (2) an adverse change in RGU mix.

(c) The increase in Switzerland/Austria’s B2B revenue is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased
volumes in voice, data and broadband internet services in Switzerland and (ii) lower revenue from internet
and voice services in Austria.

(d) The decrease in Switzerland/Austria’s other non-subscription revenue is largely due to the net effect of (i) a
decrease in installation revenue in each of Switzerland and Austria, (ii) a decrease in revenue from Austria’s
non-cable subscriber base and (iii) an increase in mobile handset sales in Switzerland.

(a) The increase in the Netherlands’ cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of
RGUs is attributable to increases in the average numbers of broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and
digital cable RGUs that were mostly offset by a decline in the average number of analog cable RGUs.

(b) The decrease in the Netherlands’ cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due to the net
effect of (i) a net decrease primarily resulting from the following factors: (a) lower ARPU due to the impact
of increases in the proportions of subscribers receiving lower-priced tiers of broadband internet and fixedline telephony services in the Netherlands’ bundles, (b) higher ARPU due to the impact of lower bundling
discounts, (c) higher ARPU from digital cable services and (d) lower ARPU due to a decrease in fixed-line
telephony call volumes and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c) The decrease in the Netherlands’ other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to lower installation
revenue.

(a) The increase in Ireland’s cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of RGUs is
attributable to increases in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony and broadband internet RGUs that
were only partially offset by declines in the average numbers of analog cable RGUs, MMDS video RGUs
and digital cable RGUs.

(b) The decrease in Ireland’s cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is primarily due to (i) an
adverse change in RGU mix and (ii) a net decrease resulting from the following factors: (a) higher ARPU
due to the inclusion of higher-priced tiers of broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony services in
Ireland’s bundles, including the impact of a price increase in March 2014, (b) lower ARPU due to the
impact of higher bundling discounts and (c) lower ARPU due to a decrease in fixed-line telephony call
volumes.

(c) The decrease in Ireland’s other non-subscription revenue is primarily due to a decrease in installation
revenue.

_Central and Eastern Europe. The decrease in Central and Eastern Europe’s revenue during 2014, as_

internet and fixed-line telephony RGUs in Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia and (ii) an increase in
the average number of RGUs at UPC DTH that were largely offset by (a) a decline in the average number of
analog cable RGUs in Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia and (b) declines in the average numbers of
digital cable and fixed-line telephony RGUs in the Czech Republic.

(b) The decrease in Central and Eastern Europe’s cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due
to the net effect of (i) a decrease primarily resulting from the following factors: (a) lower ARPU from fixedline telephony services, primarily due to (1) an increase in the proportion of subscribers receiving lowerpriced calling plans and (2) a decrease in call volumes for customers on usage-based calling plans, (b) lower
ARPU due to the impact of higher bundling discounts and (c) higher ARPU due to the inclusion of higherpriced tiers of broadband internet and digital cable services in Central and Eastern Europe’s bundles and
(ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c) The increase in Central and Eastern Europe’s B2B revenue is largely due to higher revenue from voice
services in Hungary and Poland.

(d) The decrease in Central and Eastern Europe’s other non-subscription revenue is due to (i) a decrease in
interconnect revenue, largely as a result of lower fixed-line telephony termination rates in Poland, and (ii) a
net decrease resulting from individually insignificant changes in other non-subscription revenue categories.

(a) The increase in Switzerland/Austria’s cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number
of RGUs is attributable to increases in the average numbers of broadband internet, digital cable and fixedline telephony RGUs in each of Switzerland and Austria that were only partially offset by a decline in the
average number of analog cable RGUs in each of Switzerland and Austria.

(b) The increase in Switzerland/Austria’s cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due to the
net impact of an increase in Switzerland and a decrease in Austria. The increase in Switzerland is due to
(i) an improvement in RGU mix and (ii) a net increase primarily resulting from the following factors:
(a) higher ARPU due to the inclusion of higher-priced tiers of broadband internet services and, to a lesser
extent, digital cable services in Switzerland’s promotional bundles, (b) lower ARPU due to the impact of
bundling discounts, (c) higher ARPU due to a January 2013 price increase for a basic cable connection, as

discussed below, and, to a lesser extent, a June 2013 price increase for broadband internet services, and
(d) lower ARPU due to a decrease in fixed-line telephony call volume for customers on usage-based calling
plans. The decrease in Austria is due to (1) a net decrease resulting from the following factors: (A) lower
ARPU due to the impact of bundling discounts, (B) higher ARPU due to January 2013 price increases for
digital and analog cable and broadband internet services and (C) lower ARPU due to a higher proportion of
subscribers receiving lower-priced tiers of broadband internet services in Austria’s promotional bundles and
(2) an adverse change in RGU mix.

(c) The increase in Switzerland/Austria’s other non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net
effect in Switzerland of (i) an increase in installation revenue of €6.4 million, (ii) a decrease in sales of
customer premises equipment, (iii) a decline in revenue from usage-based wholesale residential fixed-line
telephony services and (iv) an increase in advertising revenue. The increase in installation revenue includes
an increase of €6.6 million associated with a change in how we recognize installation revenue in
Switzerland as a result of a change in how we market and deliver services upon the November 2012
unencryption of the basic tier of digital television channels.

_The Netherlands. The decrease in the Netherlands’ revenue during 2013, as compared to 2012, includes_

(a) The increase in the Netherlands’ cable subscription revenue related to a change in the average number of
RGUs is attributable to the net effect of (i) increases in the average numbers of fixed-line telephony,
broadband internet and digital cable RGUs and (ii) a decline in the average number of analog cable RGUs.

(b) The decrease in the Netherlands’ cable subscription revenue related to a change in ARPU is due to the net
effect of (i) a decrease primarily resulting from the following factors: (a) lower ARPU due to a decrease in
fixed-line telephony call volume and (b) lower ARPU due to the impact of higher bundling and promotional
discounts that more than offset the positive impacts of (1) the inclusion of higher-priced tiers of digital
cable, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in the Netherlands’ promotional bundles and
(2) July 2012 price increases for bundled services and a January 2013 price increase for certain analog cable
services and (ii) an improvement in RGU mix.

(c) The decrease in the Netherlands’ B2B revenue is primarily related to lower revenue from voice and data
services.

(d) The increase in the Netherlands’ other non-subscription revenue is primarily attributable to the net effect of
(i) an increase in installation revenue, (ii) a decrease in interconnect revenue, primarily due to the impact of
reductions in fixed termination rates that became effective on August 1, 2012 and September 1, 2013, and
(iii) a decrease in revenue from late fees.

Operating expenses include programming and copyright, network operations, interconnect, customer

operations, customer care, share-based compensation and other costs related to our operations. We do not include
share-based compensation in the following discussion and analysis of the operating expenses of our reportable
segments as share-based compensation expense is not included in the performance measures of our reportable
segments. Share-based compensation expense is discussed under Discussion and Analysis of Our Consolidated
_Operating Results below. Programming and copyright costs, which represent a significant portion of our_
operating costs, are expected to rise in future periods as a result of (i) growth in the number of our digital video
subscribers, (ii) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights
associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events, and
(iii) rate increases. In addition, we are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to our labor and other costs
and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to costs and expenses that are denominated in currencies other
than the respective functional currencies of our operating segments (non-functional currency expenses). Any cost
increases that we are not able to pass on to our subscribers through rate increases would result in increased
pressure on our operating margins.

Our operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased €10.0 million or 0.8%

during 2014, as compared to 2013. This decrease includes €1.1 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our operating expenses decreased €8.9 million or 0.7%. This
decrease includes the following factors:

    - A decrease in network-related expenses of €24.2 million or 4.4%, primarily due to the net effect of
(i) decreased network and customer premises equipment maintenance costs, predominantly in
Switzerland, the Netherlands and Ireland, (ii) lower outsourced labor costs associated with customerfacing activities, primarily in the Netherlands, and (iii) higher network and customer premises
equipment maintenance costs, predominantly in our central operations;

    - A decrease in mobile access and interconnect costs of €12.6 million or 2.3%, primarily due to (i) lower
call volumes, predominantly in the Netherlands and Ireland, and (ii) decreased costs resulting from
lower rates, primarily in the Netherlands;

    - An increase in personnel costs of €10.0 million or 1.8%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased
staffing levels, primarily in our central operations, (ii) decreased costs due to changes in the proportion
of capitalizable activities during 2014 in our central operations, (iii) annual wage increases, primarily
in the Netherlands, and (iv) higher incentive compensation costs, primarily in the Netherlands;

    - A decrease in bad debt and collection expenses of €6.2 million or 6.4%, primarily due to decreases in
the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Hungary;

    - An increase in mobile handset costs of €5.5 million, primarily due to an increase in mobile handset
sales to third-party retailers in Switzerland;

    - An increase in programming and copyright costs of €5.4 million or 0.5%, largely due to the net effect
of (i) growth in digital video services predominantly in Switzerland and Ireland, (ii) increased costs for

sports rights, predominantly in Romania and (iii) certain nonrecurring adjustments related to the
settlement or reassessment of operational contingencies that resulted in a net decrease in programming
and copyright costs of €7.8 million. During 2014, these nonrecurring adjustments decreased costs by
(a) €5.3 million in Poland during the first quarter, (b) an aggregate of €3.5 million in Switzerland,
Austria and the Netherlands during the third quarter and (c) €1.7 million in the Netherlands during the
fourth quarter. During 2013, the aggregate impacts of similar reassessments and settlements in the
Netherlands and Poland decreased costs by €2.7 million;

 - A decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees of €3.9 million or 1.7%, primarily due to lower
call center costs, primarily in Switzerland and the Netherlands; and

 - A net increase resulting from individually insignificant changes in other operating expense categories.

Our operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased €23.0 million or 1.9%

during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase includes €1.5 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our operating expenses increased €30.7 million or 2.5%. This
increase includes the following factors:

    - An increase in programming and copyright costs of €19.2 million or 4.8%, primarily due to growth in
digital video services in the Netherlands, Ireland and Hungary. In addition, accrual releases related to
the settlement or reassessment of operational contingencies gave rise to an increase in programming
and copyright costs of €2.2 million, as the impact of net accrual releases that reduced the 2012 costs in
the Netherlands and Poland more than offset the impact of net accrual releases that reduced the 2013
costs in the Netherlands;

    - A decrease in interconnect costs of €15.6 million or 13.4%, primarily due to (i) lower rates in the
Netherlands and Poland and (ii) lower call volumes in Switzerland and Austria;

    - An increase in personnel costs of €12.1 million or 5.4%, primarily due to (i) increased staffing levels,
primarily in our central operations, the Netherlands and Hungary, and (ii) annual wage increases,
primarily in the Netherlands. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in personnel costs
related to lower staffing levels in Ireland;

    - An increase in network-related expenses of €11.2 million or 5.1%, primarily due to (i) increased
network and customer premises equipment maintenance costs, primarily in the Netherlands, (ii) an
increase of €2.3 million due to the net impact of favorable settlements during 2013 and 2012 for claims
of costs incurred in connection with faulty customer premises equipment, primarily in Switzerland and
the Netherlands, and (iii) higher outsourced labor costs associated with customer-facing activities in
Poland; and

    - An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of €7.7 million or 15.2%, due largely to
(i) higher call center costs in Switzerland and the Netherlands and (ii) higher consulting costs in our
central operations, primarily related to the Horizon TV platform. These increases were partially offset
by lower call center costs in Hungary primarily due to a reduced proportion of calls handled by third
parties.

SG&A expenses include human resources, information technology, general services, management, finance,

legal and sales and marketing costs, share-based compensation and other general expenses. We do not include
share-based compensation in the following discussion and analysis of the SG&A expenses of our reportable
segments as share-based compensation expense is not included in the performance measures of our reportable
segments. Share-based compensation expense is discussed under Discussion and Analysis of Our Consolidated
_Operating Results below. As noted under Operating Expenses of our Reportable Segments above, we are subject_
to inflationary pressures with respect to our labor and other costs and foreign currency exchange risk with respect
to non-functional currency expenses.

Our SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased €37.9 million or 6.3%

during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase includes €0.5 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, SG&A expenses increased €37.7 million or 6.3%. This increase
includes the following factors:

    - An increase in personnel costs of €11.7 million or 2.0%, primarily due to the net effect of (i) increased
staffing levels, primarily in our central operations, the Netherlands and Switzerland, (ii) higher
incentive compensation costs, primarily in our central operations and the Netherlands, (iii) annual wage
increases, mostly in the Netherlands and our central operations, (iv) a €2.6 million decrease in our
central operations due to the impact of an accrual release in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with
the settlement of an operational contingency and (v) decreased costs due to changes in the proportion
of capitalizable activities during 2014 in our central operations;

    - An increase in sales and marketing costs of €11.0 million or 2.2%, primarily due to the net effect of
(i) higher costs associated with advertising campaigns, primarily in the Netherlands, Switzerland and
our central operations, (ii) lower third-party sales commissions, primarily in Switzerland, and
(iii) higher third-party sales commissions, primarily in the Netherlands;

    - An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of €8.8 million or 8.6%, primarily due to
increased consulting costs associated with scale initiatives in the areas of information technology and
finance, primarily in our central operations and Switzerland; and

    - An increase in information technology-related expenses of €8.4 million or 13.7%, primarily due to
higher software and other information technology-related maintenance costs, primarily in our central
operations.

Our SG&A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) increased €23.4 million or 4.1%

during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase includes €0.6 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our SG&A expenses increased €27.0 million or 4.7%. This increase
includes the following factors:

    - An increase in personnel costs of €19.4 million or 7.1%, primarily due to (i) increased staffing levels,
primarily in our central operations, Switzerland, Hungary, Poland and Ireland, and (ii) annual wage
increases, primarily in the Netherlands, Switzerland and our central operations;

    - A decrease in sales and marketing costs of €9.0 million or 5.9%, primarily due to (i) lower third-party
sales commissions, primarily in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Hungary, Austria and the Czech
Republic, and (ii) lower costs associated with advertising campaigns and rebranding, largely in our
central operations;

    - An increase in information technology-related expenses of €7.8 million or 29.6%, primarily due to
higher software and other information technology-related maintenance costs, primarily in our central
operations, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Poland; and

    - An increase in outsourced labor and professional fees of €6.2 million or 16.8%, due largely to higher

Netherlands.

**_Operating Cash Flow of our Reportable Segments_**

Operating cash flow is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment

operating performance. As we use the term, operating cash flow is defined as revenue less operating and SG&A
expenses (excluding share-based compensation, related-party fees and allocations, depreciation and amortization
and impairment, restructuring and other operating items). For additional information concerning this performance
measure and for a reconciliation of total segment operating cash flow to our loss before income taxes, see note 15
to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Operating Cash Flow Margin—2014, 2013 and 2012_

each of our reportable segments:

Total, including central and other . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48.3 48.5 49.5

The operating cash flow margins of our reportable segments improved or remained largely consistent during

2014 as compared to 2013. These results are attributable to (i) improved operational leverage, resulting from
revenue growth that more than offset the accompanying changes in operating and SG&A expenses, and (ii) the
favorable impact of nonrecurring items, most notably in Poland as described in the operating expenses section of
_Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments. In addition, our overall operating cash flow margin during_
2014 was negatively impacted by an increase in the operating cash flow deficit of our central and other category,
primarily attributable to (a) an increase in consulting and information technology-related expenses associated
with strategic initiatives and (b) an increase in personnel costs.

With the exception of the Netherlands, the operating cash flow margins of our reportable segments

improved during 2013 as compared to 2012. As a result of significant competition, the Netherlands experienced a
decline in revenue in 2013, which resulted in a lower operating cash flow margin during 2013 as compared to
2012. In addition, the operating cash flow margin during 2013 was negatively impacted by an increase in the
operating cash flow deficit of our central and other category, which is primarily attributable to higher personnel
and consulting costs, due in part to increased levels of strategic initiatives.

For additional discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in the operating cash flow margins of our

reportable segments, see the above analyses of the revenue, operating expenses and SG&A expenses of our
reportable segments.

(a) Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding
installation fees and late fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a
discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each
individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our cable and mobile products or the
composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period.

(b) B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, wireless and data services
offered to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide
services to certain SOHO subscribers. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive enhanced service
levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or
similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. Revenue from SOHO
subscribers, which aggregated €77.3 million and €58.2 million, respectively, is included in cable
subscription revenue.

(c) Other revenue includes, among other items, installation, late fee, carriage fee and interconnect revenue.

_Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue increased €39.7 million during 2014, as compared to 2013. This_

increase includes €4.2 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and

Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated cable subscription revenue increased

€57.2 million or 1.8% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase is attributable to (i) an increase in
subscription revenue from broadband internet services of €30.0 million or 3.1%, as an increase in the average
number of broadband internet RGUs was only partially offset by the impact of lower ARPU from broadband
internet services, (ii) an increase in subscription revenue from fixed-line telephony services of €4.6 million or
1.0%, as the impact of an increase in the average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs was only partially offset

by lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services, and (iii) an increase in subscription revenue from video
services of €22.6 million or 1.3%, as the impact of higher ARPU from video services was only partially offset by
a decrease in the average number of video RGUs.

_B2B revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated B2B revenue increased_

€7.1 million or 2.8% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase is primarily attributable to the net effect of
(i) an increase in Switzerland and (ii) a decrease in Austria.

_Other revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated other revenue decreased_

€27.2 million or 15.6% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in
(i) installation revenue and (ii) fixed-line interconnect revenue.

For additional information concerning the changes in our subscription and other revenue, see Discussion

_and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Revenue — 2014 compared to 2013 above. For information_
regarding the competitive environment in certain of our markets, see Overview above.

_Operating expenses_

Our operating expenses decreased €10.0 million during 2014, as compared to 2013. This decrease is net of a

€1.1 million increase attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Our operating expenses include share-based
compensation expense, which remained unchanged during 2014. For additional information, see the discussion
under Share-based compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, FX and share-based
compensation expense, our operating expenses decreased €8.9 million or 0.7% during 2014, as compared to
2013. This decrease is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in network-related expenses, (ii) a
decrease in interconnect costs, (iii) an increase in personnel costs, (iv) a decrease in bad debt and collection
expenses, (v) an increase in mobile handset costs, (vi) an increase in programming and copyright costs and (vii) a
decrease in outsourced labor and professional fees. For additional information regarding the changes in our
operating expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Operating Expenses of our
_Reportable Segments above._

_SG&A expenses_

Our SG&A expenses increased €42.0 million during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase includes

€0.5 million attributable to acquisitions. Our SG&A expenses include share-based compensation expense, which
increased €4.1 million during 2014. For additional information, see the discussion under Share-based
_compensation expense below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, FX and share-based compensation expense,_
our SG&A expenses increased €37.7 million or 6.3% during 2014, as compared to 2013. This increase is
primarily attributable to (i) an increase in personnel costs, (ii) an increase in sales and marketing costs, (iii) an
increase in outsourced labor and professional fees and (iv) an increase in information technology-related
expenses. For additional information regarding the changes in our SG&A expenses, see Discussion and Analysis

Performance Awards, which were issued on June 24, 2013.

For additional information concerning our share-based compensation, see note 11 to the December 31, 2014

Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Related-party fees and allocations, net_

We recorded related-party fees and allocations, net, of (€27.3 million) during 2014 as compared to

€3.3 million during 2013. These amounts represent the aggregate net effect of charges between subsidiaries of
UPC Holding and various Liberty Global subsidiaries that are outside of UPC Holding. These charges generally
relate to management, finance, legal, technology and other corporate and administrative services provided to or
by our subsidiaries and, in the case of charges to Unitymedia KabelBW, also include charges related to marketing
and other services that support Unitymedia KabelBW’s broadband communications operations, including the use
of the UPC trademark. For additional information, see notes 12 and 16 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated
Financial Statements.

_Depreciation and amortization expense_

Our depreciation and amortization expense increased €21.0 million during 2014, as compared to 2013.

Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense increased €21.5 million or 2.5%. This
increase is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase associated with property and equipment additions
related to the installation of customer premises equipment, the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other
capital initiatives, (ii) a decrease associated with certain assets becoming fully depreciated, largely in
Switzerland, Poland, Ireland and Austria, (iii) a decrease associated with fully amortized customer relationships,
primarily in Poland and Romania, and (iv) a decrease associated with changes in the useful lives of certain assets,
primarily in Switzerland and Ireland.

_Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net_

We recognized impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, of €6.0 million during 2014, as

compared to €2.4 million during 2013. These amounts are primarily related to restructuring charges associated
with reorganization and integration activities in certain of our operations.

If, among other factors, (i) our enterprise value or Liberty Global’s equity values were to decline

significantly or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our
results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that
impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill, and to a lesser extent,

other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant. For additional information, see

Our third-party interest expense decreased €81.9 million during 2014, as compared to 2013. This decrease is

primarily attributable to lower average outstanding debt balances. For additional information regarding our
outstanding indebtedness, see note 8 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

It is possible that (i) the interest rates on any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates

on our existing indebtedness and (ii) the interest rates on our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future
periods. As further discussed in note 5 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements, we use
derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks.

_Interest expense—related-party_

Our related-party interest expense primarily relates to the interest expense on the Shareholder Loan. Our

related-party interest expense increased €20.7 million during 2014 as compared to 2013. This increase is
primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of the Shareholder Loan. For additional
information, see notes 8 and 12 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Foreign currency transaction gains (losses), net_

Our foreign currency transaction gains or losses primarily result from the remeasurement of monetary assets

and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable
entity. Unrealized foreign currency transaction gains or losses are computed based on period-end exchange rates
and are non-cash in nature until such time as the amounts are settled. The details of our foreign currency
transaction gains (losses), net, are as follows:

Europe, which generally are denominated in the currency of the applicable operating subsidiary, and
(ii) loans between certain of our non-operating subsidiaries in Europe.

_Losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net_

We recognized losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of €42.0 million during 2014. The loss

during 2014 includes the following:

    - a €30.0 million loss during the second quarter related to the repayment of the UPC Holding 9.875%
Senior Notes, which includes (i) the payment of €14.3 million of redemption premium, (ii) the writeoff of €12.5 million of unamortized discount and (iii) the write-off of €3.2 million of deferred financing
costs; and

    - a €12.0 million loss during the first quarter related to the repayment of Facilities R, S, AE and AF
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, which includes (i) the write-off of €8.5 million of
deferred financing costs and (ii) the write-off of €3.5 million of an unamortized discount.

We recognized losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of €75.3 million during 2013. The loss

during 2013 includes the following:

    - a €65.9 million loss during the first quarter, which includes (i) the payment of €27.5 million of
aggregate redemption premium related to UPC Holding’s then existing UPC Holding 8.0% Senior
Notes and UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes, (ii) the write-off of €18.9 million of unamortized
discount related to the UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes, (iii) the write-off of €14.7 million of
aggregate deferred financing costs associated with the UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and the UPC
Holding 9.75% Senior Notes and (iv) the payment of €4.8 million of aggregate interest incurred on the
UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and the UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes between the respective
dates that we and the trustee were legally discharged; and

    - a €9.0 million loss during the second quarter related to the prepayment of amounts outstanding under
facilities R, S, T, U and X of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, which includes
(i) €5.8 million of third-party costs and (ii) the €3.2 million write-off of deferred financing costs and an
unamortized discount.

For additional information concerning our losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net, see note 8 to

the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Income tax expense_

We recognized income tax expense of €89.8 million and €69.5 million during 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The income tax expense during 2014 differs from the expected income tax benefit of €233.7 million (based

on the Dutch 25.0% income tax rate) primarily due to (i) the negative impact of certain permanent differences
between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items and (ii) a net decrease in valuation
allowances.

71


-----

The income tax expense during 2013 differs from the expected income tax benefit of €164.3 million (based

on the Dutch 25.0% income tax rate) primarily due to the negative impact of certain permanent differences
between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items, due mostly to a change in tax
legislation enacted on January 1, 2013 restricting the deductibility of interest expense in the Netherlands.

For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 9 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated

Financial Statements.

_Net loss_

During 2014 and 2013, we reported net losses of €1,024.5 million and €726.6 million, respectively,

including (i) operating income of €852.7 million and €839.0 million, respectively, (ii) non-operating expense of
€1,787.4 million and €1,496.1 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax expense of €89.8 million and
€69.5 million, respectively.

Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments, (ii) movements in

foreign currency exchange rates and (iii) the disposition of assets and changes in ownership are subject to a high
degree of volatility, and as such, any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the
absence of significant gains in the future from these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to
achieve earnings from operations is largely dependent on our ability to increase our aggregate operating cash
flow to a level that more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (a) share-based compensation expense,
(b) related-party fees and allocations, net, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) impairment, restructuring and
other operating items, net, (e) interest expense, (f) other net non-operating expenses and (g) income tax expenses.

Subject to the limitations included in our various debt instruments, we expect that Liberty Global will cause

our company to maintain our debt at current levels relative to our consolidated operating cash flow for the
foreseeable future. For information concerning our expectations with respect to trends that may affect certain
aspects of our operating results in future periods, see the discussion under Overview above. For information
concerning the reasons for changes in specific line items in our consolidated statements of operations, see the
discussion under Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our
_Consolidated Operating Results above._

_Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests_

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests remained relatively unchanged during 2014, as

compared to 2013.

(a) Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding
installation fees and late fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a

-----

discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each
individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our cable and mobile products or the
composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period.

(b) B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, wireless and data services
offered to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide
services to certain SOHO subscribers. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive enhanced service
levels along with video, broadband internet or fixed-line telephony services that are the same or similar to
the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which
aggregated €58.2 million and €41.0 million, respectively, is included in cable subscription revenue.

(c) Other revenue includes, among other items, installation, late fee, interconnect and carriage fee revenue.

_Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue increased €21.1 million during 2013, as compared to 2012. This_

increase includes €3.9 million, attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and
FX, total consolidated revenue increased €49.3 million or 1.4%.

_Subscription revenue. The details of the increase in our consolidated subscription revenue for 2013, as_

compared to 2012, are as follows (in millions):

Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated cable subscription revenue increased

€46.4 million or 1.5% during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase is attributable to the net effect of (i) an
increase in subscription revenue from broadband internet services of €62.5 million or 6.9%, as the impact of an
increase in the average number of broadband internet RGUs was only partially offset by lower ARPU from
broadband internet services, (ii) a decrease in subscription revenue from video services of €21.3 million or 1.2%,
as the decline in the average number of video RGUs was only partially offset by the impact of higher ARPU
from video services, (iii) an increase in subscription revenue from fixed-line telephony services of €5.2 million or
1.1%, as the impact of an increase in the average number of fixed-line telephony RGUs was only partially offset
by lower ARPU from fixed-line telephony services.

_B2B revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated B2B revenue decreased_

€6.8 million or 2.6% during 2013, as compared to 2012. This decrease is primarily due to decreases in the
Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria.

_Other revenue. Excluding the effects of acquisitions and FX, our consolidated other revenue increased_

€10.6 million or 6.4% during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase is primarily attributable to the net impact
of (i) an increase in installation revenue, (ii) a decrease in interconnect revenue, (iii) an increase in advertising
revenue and (iv) a decrease in sales of customer premises equipment.

For additional information concerning the changes in our subscription and other revenue, see Discussion

_and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Revenue — 2013 compared to 2012 above._

_Operating expenses_

Our operating expenses increased €23.0 million during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase includes

€1.5 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Our operating expenses include share-based compensation
expense, which remained unchanged during 2013. For additional information, see the discussion following
_SG&A expenses below. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, FX and share-based compensation expense, our_
operating expenses increased €30.7 million or 2.5% during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase is primarily

73


-----

attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in programming and copyright costs, (ii) a decrease in interconnect
costs, (iii) an increase in personnel costs, (iv) an increase in network-related expenses and (v) an increase in
outsourced labor and professional fees. For additional information regarding the changes in our operating
expenses, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments — Operating Expenses of our Reportable
_Segments above._

_SG&A expenses_

Our SG&A expenses increased €30.7 million during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase includes

€0.6 million attributable to the impact of acquisitions. Our SG&A expenses include share-based compensation
expense, which increased €7.3 million during 2013. For additional information, see the discussion in the
following paragraph. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, FX and share-based compensation expense, our
SG&A expenses increased €27.0 million or 4.7% during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase is primarily
attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in personnel costs, (ii) a decrease in sales and marketing costs,
(iii) an increase in information technology-related expenses and (iv) an increase in outsourced labor and
professional fees. For additional information regarding the changes in our SG&A expenses, see Discussion and

For additional information concerning our share-based compensation, see note 11 to the December 31, 2014

Consolidated Financial Statements

_Related-party fees and allocations, net_

We recorded related-party fees and allocations, net, of €3.3 million during 2013 as compared to

(€2.4 million) during 2012. For additional information, see notes 12 and 16 to the December 31, 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Depreciation and amortization expense_

Our depreciation and amortization expense decreased €32.8 million during 2013 as compared to 2012.

Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense decreased €25.4 million or 2.8%. This
decrease is primarily due to the net effect of (i) increases associated with property and equipment additions
related to the installation of customer premises equipment, the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other
capital initiatives, (ii) decreases associated with certain assets becoming fully depreciated, largely in Switzerland,
the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, (iii) decreases associated with changes in the useful lives of
certain assets, primarily in Switzerland, Ireland, Austria and Poland, and (iv) decreases associated with fully
amortized customer relationships, primarily in Hungary and Romania.

-----

_Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net_

We recognized impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, of €2.4 million during 2013, as

compared to €7.0 million during 2012. These amounts primarily are related to restructuring charges associated
with reorganization and integration activities in certain of our operations.

_Interest expense—third-party_

Our third-party interest expense decreased €0.7 million during 2013, as compared to 2012. This decrease is

primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a lower weighted average interest rate and (ii) higher average
outstanding debt balances. The decrease in our weighted average interest rate is primarily related to (a) the
completion of certain financing transactions that resulted in extended maturities and net decreases to certain of
our interest rates and (b) decreases in certain of the base rates for our variable-rate indebtedness. For additional
information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see note 8 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial
Statements.

_Interest expense—related-party_

Our related-party interest expense primarily relates to the interest expense on the Shareholder Loan. Our

related-party interest expense increased €15.1 million during 2013, as compared to 2012. This increase is
primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding balance of the Shareholder Loan. For additional
information, see notes 8 and 12 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a) The loss during 2013 is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) gains associated with increases in
market interest rates in the Swiss franc and euro markets, (ii) losses associated with increases in market
interest rates in the U.S. dollar market, (iii) gains associated with decreases in the values of the
Chilean Peso, Czech koruna, Swiss franc, Polish zloty and Hungarian forint relative to the euro and
(iv) losses associated with increases in the values of the euro and Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar. In
addition, the loss during 2013 includes a net loss of €19.2 million resulting from changes in our credit risk
valuation adjustments. The loss during 2012 is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) losses associated
with decreases in market interest rates in the Hungarian forint, euro, Polish zloty, Swiss franc and
Czech koruna markets, (ii) losses associated with increases in the values of the Polish zloty, Hungarian
forint, Chilean peso and Swiss franc relative to the euro, (iii) losses associated with increases in the values
of the euro, Swiss franc and Chilean peso relative to the U.S. dollar and (iv) gains associated with decreases
in market interest rates in the U.S. dollar market. In addition, the loss during 2012 includes a net loss of
€57.6 million resulting from changes in our credit risk valuation adjustments.

    - a €65.9 million loss during the first quarter, which includes (i) the payment of €27.5 million of
aggregate redemption premium related to UPC Holding’s then existing UPC Holding 8.0% Senior
Notes and UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes, (ii) the write-off of €18.9 million of unamortized
discount related to the UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes, (iii) the write-off of €14.7 million of
aggregate deferred financing costs associated with the UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and the
UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes and (iv) the payment of €4.8 million of aggregate interest incurred
on the UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and the UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes between the
respective dates that we and the trustee were legally discharged; and

    - a €9.0 million loss during the second quarter related to the prepayment of amounts outstanding under
facilities R, S, T, U and X of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, which includes
(i) €5.8 million of third-party costs and (ii) the €3.2 million write-off of deferred financing costs and an
unamortized discount.

We recognized losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net, of €12.7 million during 2012. The loss

during 2012 includes the following:

    - a €9.8 million loss during the fourth quarter associated with the write-off of deferred financing costs
and unamortized discount in connection with the prepayment of Facility AB under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility;

    - a €1.5 million loss during the first quarter associated with the payment of third-party costs in
connection with the execution of Facility AE under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility; and

    - a €1.5 million loss during the first quarter associated with the write-off of deferred financing costs in
connection with the prepayment of amounts outstanding under certain facilities of the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility.

For additional information concerning our losses on debt modification and extinguishment, net, see note 8 to

the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Income tax expense_

We recognized income tax expense of €69.5 million and €73.0 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The income tax expense during 2013 differs from the expected income tax benefit of €164.3 million (based

on the Dutch 25.0% income tax rate) primarily due to the negative impact of certain permanent differences
between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items, due mostly to a change in tax
legislation enacted on January 1, 2013 restricting the deductibility of interest expense in the Netherlands.

76


-----

The income tax expense during 2012 differs from the expected income tax benefit of €237.4 million (based

on the Dutch 25.0% income tax rate) primarily due to the negative impacts of (i) certain permanent differences
between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other items, (ii) a net increase in valuation
allowances and (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items
associated with investments in subsidiaries.

For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 9 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated

Financial Statements.

_Net loss_

During 2013 and 2012, we reported net losses of €726.6 million and €1,022.5 million, respectively,

including (i) operating income of €839.0 million and €839.9 million, respectively, (ii) non-operating expense of
€1,496.1 million and €1,789.4 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax expense of €69.5 million and
€73.0 million, respectively.

_Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests_

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests remained relatively unchanged during 2013, as

compared to 2012.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Sources and Uses of Cash_**

As a holding company, UPC Holding’s primary assets are its investments in consolidated subsidiaries.

UPC Holding’s primary subsidiary is UPC Broadband Holding, which owns all of the operating subsidiaries that
are consolidated by UPC Holding. Although our consolidated operating subsidiaries generate cash from
operating activities, the terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of UPC Broadband Holding may
restrict our ability to access the assets of these subsidiaries. These subsidiaries accounted for €59.3 million of our
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of
these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling
interests and other factors.

_Liquidity of UPC Holding_

As UPC Holding typically does not hold significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at the parent

level, UPC Holding’s primary source of liquidity is proceeds received from UPC Broadband Holding (and
indirectly from UPC Broadband Holding’s subsidiaries) in the form of loans or distributions. As noted above,
various factors may limit the ability of UPC Holding’s direct and indirect subsidiaries to loan or distribute cash to
UPC Holding. From time to time, UPC Holding may also supplement its sources of liquidity with net proceeds
received in connection with the issuance of debt instruments and/or loans or contributions from LGE Financing
(and ultimately Liberty Global and other Liberty Global subsidiaries). No assurance can be given that any
external funding would be available on favorable terms, or at all.

The ongoing cash needs of UPC Holding include (i) corporate general and administrative expenses and

(ii) interest payments on the UPC Holding Senior Notes. From time to time, UPC Holding may also require cash
in connection with (a) the repayment of outstanding debt (including the repurchase or exchange of outstanding
debt securities in the open market or privately-negotiated transactions and net repayments to LGE Financing
pursuant to the Shareholder Loan, as described in note 8 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial
Statements), (b) the funding of loans or distributions to LGE Financing (and ultimately Liberty Global and other
Liberty Global subsidiaries), (c) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (d) acquisitions, (e) other investment
opportunities or (f) income tax payments.

_Liquidity of Subsidiaries_

In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the primary sources of liquidity of our subsidiaries are cash

provided by operations and, in the case of UPC Broadband Holding, borrowing availability under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. For the details of the borrowing availability under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility at December 31, 2014, see note 8 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial

77


-----

Statements. Our subsidiaries’ liquidity generally is used to fund property and equipment additions, debt service
requirements and payments required by UPC Broadband Holding’s derivative instruments. From time to time,
our subsidiaries may also require funding in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities,
(ii) loans to UPC Holding or other Liberty Global subsidiaries, (iii) capital distributions to UPC Holding or
(iv) the satisfaction of contingencies. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to
our subsidiaries on favorable terms, or at all.

For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under Consolidated

_Statements of Cash Flows below._

**_Capitalization_**

At December 31, 2014, our outstanding consolidated third-party debt and capital lease obligations

aggregated €8,300.6 million, including €362.3 million that is classified as current in our consolidated balance
sheet and €7,930.7 million that is not due until 2020 or thereafter. For additional information concerning our
current debt maturities, see note 8 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

When it is cost effective, we generally seek to match the denomination of the borrowings of our subsidiaries

with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings. As further discussed
in note 5 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements, we also use derivative instruments to
mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with our debt instruments.

Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the

credit agreements and indentures of UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding is dependent primarily on our
ability to maintain or increase the operating cash flow of our operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate
returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional
debt financing is limited by the leverage covenants contained in our and UPC Broadband Holding’s debt
instruments. For example, if the operating cash flow of UPC Broadband Holding were to decline, we could be
required to partially repay or limit our borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to
maintain compliance with applicable covenants. No assurance can be given that we would have sufficient sources
of liquidity, or that any external funding would be available on favorable terms, or at all, to fund any such
required repayment. The ability to access available borrowings under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
and/or our ability to complete additional financing transactions can also be impacted by the interplay of average
and spot foreign currency rates with respect to leverage calculations under the indentures for UPC Holding’s
senior notes.

At December 31, 2014, UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding were in compliance with their

respective debt covenants. In addition, we do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance with respect to any
of our debt covenants that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity during the next 12 months.

Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we completed certain transactions that will impact the our borrowing

availability under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. For additional information, see note 16 to the
December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

Notwithstanding our negative working capital position at December 31, 2014, we believe that we have

sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and capital lease obligations and to fund
our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later
years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be
given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In
this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any
adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity
and financial position. However, (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties could (a) reduce amounts
available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any
failed financial institution and (ii) tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access
debt financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, sustained or increased competition, particularly in
combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash
flows and liquidity.

With the exception of the UPC Holding Senior Notes, all of our consolidated third-party debt and capital

lease obligations had been borrowed or incurred by our subsidiaries at December 31, 2014.

**_Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows_**

_General. Our cash flows are subject to significant variations due to FX._

_Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows—2014 compared to 2013_

_Summary. The 2014 and 2013 consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows:_

**Year ended December 31,**

**2014** **2013** **Change**

**in millions**

Net cash provided by operating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 1,015.8 € 947.1 € 68.7

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € (406.6) € 434.6 € (841.2)

_Operating Activities. The increase in net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to_

the net effect of (i) an increase in the cash provided by our operating cash flow and related working capital
changes, (ii) an increase in cash provided due to lower cash payments for interest, (iii) a decrease in cash
provided due to higher cash payments related to derivative instruments and (iv) lower cash interest and dividends
received.

_Investing Activities. The decrease in net cash used by our investing activities is primarily due to (i) an_

increase in cash of €323.3 million associated with the sale of a loan receivable and (ii) an increase in cash of
€203.4 million associated with lower capital expenditures.

The capital expenditures that we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows do not include

(i) amounts that our company has financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements
or (ii) purchased assets transferred to our company by another entity under the common control of Liberty Global
in exchange for non-cash increases to the Shareholder Loan or non-cash contributions from our parent (non-cash
related-party capital additions). Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and
equipment when the underlying assets are delivered, and in the case of vendor financing and capital lease
arrangements and non-cash related-party capital additions that are settled through increases to the Shareholder
Loan, as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid. In the following discussion, we refer to (i) our capital
expenditures as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, which exclude non-cash related-party
capital additions and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease arrangements, and
(ii) our total property and equipment additions, which include our capital expenditures on an accrual basis, noncash related-party capital additions and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or capital lease
arrangements. For additional information, see notes 7 and 8 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial
Statements.

A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital

expenditures as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows is set forth below:

**Year ended December 31,**

**2014** **2013**

**in millions**

Property and equipment additions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 834.2 € 845.0

79


-----

The decrease in our property and equipment additions is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in

expenditures for the purchase and installation of customer premises equipment and (ii) an increase in
expenditures for new build and upgrade projects to expand services. During 2014 and 2013, our property and
equipment additions represented 23.1% and 23.6% of our revenue, respectively.

After giving effect to the Transfers, we expect the percentage of revenue represented by our aggregate 2015

consolidated property and equipment additions to range from 20% to 22%. Following the Corporate Entities
Transfer, property and equipment additions that were previously included within UPC Holding will be replaced
with depreciation charges to our company as a part of related-party fees and allocations. The actual amount of
our 2015 consolidated property and equipment additions may vary from expected amounts for a variety of
reasons, including (i) changes in (a) the competitive or regulatory environment, (b) business plans, (c) our current
or expected future operating results or (d) foreign currency exchange rates and (ii) the availability of sufficient
capital. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our actual property and equipment additions will not vary
materially from our expectations.

_Financing Activities. The change in net cash provided (used) by our financing activities is primarily_

attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in cash used of €1,134.7 million due to higher net repayments of
third-party debt, (ii) an increase in cash used of €854.4 million related to a return of an advance to a subsidiary of
Liberty Global, (iii) a decrease in cash used of €505.8 million due to higher net borrowings of related-party debt,
(iv) a decrease in cash used of €102.7 million due to lower deemed distributions to related parties, (v) an increase
in cash used of €51.3 million related to changes in cash collateral, (vi) a decrease in cash used of €44.4 million
due to lower payments for financing costs and debt premiums and (vii) an increase in cash used of €16.2 million
due to higher cash payments related to derivative instruments.

_Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows—2013 compared to 2012_

_Summary. The 2013 and 2012 consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows:_

_Operating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable_

to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash provided by our operating cash flow and related working capital
changes, (ii) an increase in cash provided due to lower cash payments related to derivative instruments and (iii) a
decrease in the reported net cash provided by operating activities due to FX.

_Investing Activities. The increase in net cash used by our investing activities is primarily due to the net_

effect of (i) an increase in cash used of €96.2 million associated with higher capital expenditures and (ii) a
decrease in cash used of €35.8 million associated with lower cash paid in connection with acquisitions.

A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital

expenditures as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows is set forth below:

**Year ended December 31,**

**2013** **2012**

**in millions**

Property and equipment additions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 845.0 € 755.1

-----

(a) The 2012 amount includes €146.4 million of property and equipment that was acquired on our behalf
through vendor financing arrangements of LG B.V. during the year ended December 31, 2012. At
December 31, 2012, €63.7 million of this amount was reclassified to the Shareholder Loan and the
remainder was reclassified to our third-party vendor financing. The amount reclassified to our third-party
vendor financing obligation relates to vendor financing arrangements for which we and LG B.V. are
co-obligors. For additional information, see note 7 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The increase in our property and equipment additions is primarily due to (i) an increase in expenditures for

support capital, such as information technology upgrades and general support systems, (ii) an increase in
expenditures for new build and upgrade projects to expand services and (iii) increase in expenditures for the
purchase and installation of customer premises equipment. During 2013 and 2012, our property and equipment
additions represented 23.6% and 21.3% of our revenue, respectively.

_Financing Activities. The change in net cash provided (used) by our financing activities is primarily_

attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in cash of €1,177.9 million related to higher net borrowings of
related-party debt, (ii) an decrease in cash provided of €455.6 million related to lower net borrowings of thirdparty debt, (iii) an increase in cash used of €498.2 million due to higher deemed distributions to related parties,
(iv) an increase in cash provided of €436.0 million related to an advance from a subsidiary of Liberty Global,
(v) a decrease in cash used of €51.6 million due to lower cash payments related to derivative instruments, (vi) a
decrease in cash provided of €49.6 million related to changes in cash collateral and (vii) an increase in cash used
of €43.2 million due to higher payments for financing costs and debt premiums.

(a) The commitments reflected in this table do not reflect any liabilities that are included in our December 31,
2014 consolidated balance sheet other than debt and capital lease obligations. Our liability for uncertain tax
positions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate (€14.7 million at December 31, 2014) has been
excluded from the table as the amount and timing of any related payments are not subject to reasonable
estimation.

(b) Amounts are based on interest rates, interest payment dates and contractual maturities in effect as of
December 31, 2014. These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes only and will likely differ from
the actual cash payments required in future periods. In addition, the amounts presented do not include the
impact of our interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs or discounts, all of which affect our
overall cost of borrowing. Amounts associated with related-party debt are excluded from the table.

Purchase commitments include unconditional purchase obligations associated with commitments to

purchase customer premises and other equipment that are enforceable and legally binding on us, including
€18.0 million associated with related-party purchase obligations.

81


-----

Network and connectivity commitments include commitments associated with (i) fiber leasing, (ii) satellite

carriage services provided to our company and (iii) commitments associated with MVNO agreements. The
amounts reflected in the table with respect to certain of our MVNO commitments represent fixed minimum
amounts payable under these agreements and, therefore, may be significantly less than the actual amounts we
ultimately pay in these periods.

Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming contracts that

are enforceable and legally binding on us in that we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the
actual number of subscribers to the programming services or (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our
subscribers or dispose of a portion of our distribution systems. In addition, programming commitments do not
include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments. Accordingly,
the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the amounts we
expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Payments to programming vendors have in the past
represented, and are expected to continue to represent in the future, a significant portion of our operating costs. In
this regard, during 2014, 2013 and 2012, the programming and copyright costs incurred by our broadband
communications and DTH operations aggregated €421.6 million, €410.2 million, and €402.0 million
respectively.

Other commitments relate primarily to (i) obligations associated with information technology and other

service agreements and (ii) certain fixed minimum contractual commitments associated with our agreements with
municipal authorities. Commitments arising from acquisition agreements are not reflected in the above table.

In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under

(i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to
make payments in future periods. For information regarding projected cash flows associated with these derivative
instruments, see Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivative Instruments below. For information regarding
our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during
2014, 2013 and 2012, see note 5 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

We also have commitments pursuant to agreements with, and obligations imposed by, franchise authorities

and municipalities, which may include obligations in certain markets to move aerial cable to underground ducts
or to upgrade, rebuild or extend portions of our broadband communication systems. Such amounts are not
included in the above table because they are not fixed or determinable.

**_Projected Cash Flows Associated with Derivative Instruments_**

The following table provides information regarding the projected cash flows associated with our derivative

instruments at December 31, 2014. The euro equivalents presented below are based on interest rates and
exchange rates that were in effect as of December 31, 2014. These amounts are presented for illustrative purposes
only and will likely differ from the actual cash payments required in future periods. For additional information
regarding our derivative instruments, including our counterparty credit risk, see note 5 to the December 31, 2014
Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates**

In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and

assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related

-----

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are
reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which would potentially result in materially
different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are
critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to account
for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change:

    - Impairment of property and equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill);

    - Costs associated with construction and installation activities;

    - Useful lives of long-lived assets;

    - Fair value measurements; and

    - Income tax accounting.

For additional information concerning our significant accounting policies, see note 3 to the December 31,

2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets_**

_Carrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets_

(including goodwill) that were held for use comprised 86% of our total assets at December 31, 2014.

We review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our

intangible assets (other than goodwill) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include, among other items, (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a
long-lived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change
in legal factors or business climate in the markets in which we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For
purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely
independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see below). If the
carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated
by such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the
amount that the carrying value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair
value by considering (a) sale prices for similar assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an
appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower
of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on October 1 and whenever other facts and

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations,
we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if goodwill may be impaired. If it is more-likely-than-not that
a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to
its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment
(referred to as a “component”). In most cases, our operating segments are deemed to be a reporting unit either
because the operating segment is comprised of only a single component, or the components below the operating
segment are aggregated as they have similar economic characteristics. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its
carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an
impairment loss.

When required, considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of reporting units

and underlying long-lived assets. We typically determine fair value using an income-based approach (discounted
cash flows) based on assumptions in our long-range business plans and, in some cases, a combination of an
income-based approach and a market-based approach. With respect to our discounted cash flow analysis used in
the income-based approach, the timing and amount of future cash flows under these business plans require
estimates, among other items, of subscriber growth and retention rates, rates charged per product, expected gross
margin and operating cash flow margins and expected property and equipment additions. The development of
these cash flows, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and actual
results could vary significantly from such estimates. Our determination of the discount rate is based on a
weighted average cost of capital approach, which uses a market participant’s cost of equity and after-tax cost of
debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. Based on the results of our 2014 qualitative assessment of
our reporting unit carrying values, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that fair value exceeded
carrying value for all of our reporting units.

83


-----

During the three years ended December 31, 2014, we recorded no impairments of our property and

equipment and intangible assets (including goodwill).

If, among other factors, (i) our enterprise value or Liberty Global’s equity values were to decline

significantly, or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our
results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that
impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill, and to a lesser extent,
other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

**_Costs Associated with Construction and Installation Activities_**

We capitalize costs associated with the construction of new cable transmission and distribution facilities and

the installation of new cable services. Installation activities that are capitalized include (i) the initial connection
(or drop) from our cable system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation of
equipment for additional services, such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of
other customer-facing activities, such as reconnecting customer locations where a drop already exists,
disconnecting customer locations and repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed as incurred.

The nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation

activities involves significant judgment. In addition to direct external and internal labor and materials, we also
capitalize other costs directly attributable to our construction and installation activities, including dispatch costs,
quality-control costs, vehicle-related costs, and certain warehouse-related costs. The capitalization of these costs
is based on time sheets, time studies, standard costs, call tracking systems and other verifiable means that directly
link the costs incurred with the applicable capitalizable activity. We continuously monitor the appropriateness of
our capitalization policies and update the policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and
circumstances, such as the development of new products and services, and changes in the manner that
installations or construction activities are performed.

**_Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets_**

We depreciate our property and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the

assets. The determination of the useful lives of property and equipment requires significant management
judgment, based on factors such as the estimated physical lives of the assets, technological changes, changes in
anticipated use, legal and economic factors, rebuild and equipment swap-out plans, and other factors. Our
intangible assets with finite lives primarily consist of customer relationships. Customer relationship intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated weighted average life of the customer
relationships. The determination of the estimated useful life of customer relationship intangible assets requires
significant management judgment and is primarily based on historical and forecasted subscriber disconnect rates,
adjusted when necessary for risk associated with demand, competition, technological changes and other
economic factors. We regularly review whether changes to estimated useful lives are required in order to
accurately reflect the economic use of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives. Any
changes to estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively. Depreciation and amortization expense during
2014, 2013 and 2012 was €885.0 million, €864.0 million and €896.8 million, respectively. A 10% increase in the
aggregate amount of the depreciation and amortization expense during 2014 would have resulted in a
€88.5 million or 10.4% decrease in our 2014 operating income.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

U.S. GAAP provides guidance with respect to the recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements and

for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted
market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

_Recurring Valuations. We perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to our derivative_

instruments, which are carried at fair value. We use cash flow valuation models to determine the fair values of
our interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments. For a detailed discussion of the inputs we use to
determine the fair value of our derivative instruments, see note 6 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated
Financial Statements. See also note 5 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements for
information concerning our derivative instruments.

84


-----

Changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments have had, and we believe will continue to have, a

significant and volatile impact on our results of operations. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, our results of
operations included net gains (losses) of €103.1 million, (€62.4 million) and (€515.9 million), respectively,
attributable to changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments.

As further described in note 6 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements, actual amounts

received or paid upon the settlement of our derivative instruments may differ materially from the recorded fair
values at December 31, 2014.

_Nonrecurring Valuations. Our nonrecurring valuations are primarily associated with (i) the application of_

acquisition accounting and (ii) impairment assessments, both of which require that we make fair value
determinations as of the applicable valuation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash
flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, replacement or
reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired
net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may
engage third-party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of
depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and income tax expense or benefit that we report. Our
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently
uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded through the application of
acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to impairment assessments. For additional
information, see notes 4, 6 and 7 to the December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

**_Income Tax Accounting_**

We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax

assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we
operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. This process
requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of
such items.

Net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if we believe it more-likely-than-not such net

deferred tax assets will not be realized. Establishing or reducing a tax valuation allowance requires us to make
assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and
available tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2014, the aggregate valuation allowance provided against
deferred tax assets was €1,683.2 million. The actual amount of deferred income tax benefits realized in future
periods will likely differ from the net deferred tax assets reflected in our December 31, 2014 consolidated
balance sheet due to, among other factors, possible future changes in income tax law or interpretations thereof in
the jurisdictions in which we operate and differences between estimated and actual future taxable income. Any of
such factors could have a material effect on our current and deferred tax positions as reported in our consolidated
financial statements. A high degree of judgment is required to assess the impact of possible future outcomes on
our current and deferred tax positions.

Tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have a presence are subject to varied interpretation, and many tax

positions we take are subject to significant uncertainty regarding whether the position will be ultimately
sustained after review by the relevant tax authority. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position
when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination.
The determination of whether the tax position meets the more-likely-than-not threshold requires a facts-based
judgment using all information available. In a number of cases, we have concluded that the more-likely-than-not
threshold is not met, and accordingly, the amount of tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial
statements is different than the amount taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. As of December 31,
2014, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for financial reporting purposes, but taken or expected to be taken
on tax returns, was €27.4 million, of which €17.5 million would have a favorable impact on our effective income
tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation
allowances.

We are required to continually assess our tax positions, and the results of tax examinations or changes in

judgment can result in substantial changes to our unrecognized tax benefits.

**BUSINESS OF UPC HOLDING**

_In the following text, the terms, “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires,_

_to UPC Holding or collectively to UPC Holding and its subsidiaries._

We are an international provider of (i) video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in seven

European countries and (ii) mobile services in four European countries. We also provide DTH services to
customers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through UPC DTH.

Provided below is an overview of our services followed by country specific information. Unless otherwise

indicated, the operational data provided below is as of December 31, 2014 after giving effect to the UPC Ireland
Transfer and the UPC NL Transfer.

**Broadband Distribution**

**_Overview_**

We offer a variety of broadband services over our cable distribution systems, including video, broadband

internet and fixed-line telephony and, in certain of our operations, we offer mobile services serving 6.8 million
customers across seven countries at December 31, 2014. We design these services to enable our customers to
access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. In most of our footprint, the core of our offer
to customers is “triple-play”, which we use to describe bundled services of digital video, internet and fixed-line
telephony in one subscription. We are enhancing this offer by expanding our services to include mobile in certain
markets. Available service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has
been upgraded for two-way communications. In select markets, we also offer video services through DTH or
through multichannel multipoint (microwave) distribution systems (MMDS). In terms of video subscribers, we
operate the largest cable network in each of Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and
Switzerland and the second largest cable network in Romania.

The following table presents certain operating data as of December 31, 2014, with respect to the cable, DTH

and MMDS systems of our subsidiaries after giving effect to the UPC Ireland Transfer and the UPC NL Transfer.

(1) Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to
our networks without materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH and MMDS homes. Our
Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from
new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH. With respect to MMDS, one MMDS customer
is equal to one Home Passed. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used
in Switzerland (see note 11 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks.

(2) Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically
capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and fixed-line telephony services.

(3) Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or fixedline telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to
how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include equivalent billing unit (EBU)
adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts. For further
information regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables below. Customer
Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our
services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as
two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile customers from Customer Relationships.

87


-----

(4) Revenue Generating Unit is separately an Analog Cable Subscriber, Digital Cable Subscriber, DTH
Subscriber, MMDS Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Fixed-line Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential
multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential
customer in our Austrian system subscribed to our digital cable service, fixed-line telephony service and
broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Analog
Cable, Digital Cable, DTH, MMDS, Internet and Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are
counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for
any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a
primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled
cable, internet or fixed-line telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any
bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free
promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service
period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to
employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our
externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our December 31, 2014 RGU counts exclude our separately
reported postpaid mobile subscribers in the Hungary, Poland, Switzerland and Austria of 11,200, 10,600,
8,800 and 200, respectively. Our mobile subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber
identification module (SIM) cards in service.

(5) Analog Cable Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our
analog cable service over our broadband network. Our Analog Cable Subscribers also include subscribers
who may use a purchased set-top box or other means to receive our basic digital cable channels without
subscribing to any services that would require the payment of recurring monthly fees in addition to the basic
analog service fee (Basic Digital Cable Subscriber). Our Basic Digital Cable Subscribers are attributable to
the fact that our basic digital cable channels are not encrypted in certain portions of our footprint. In Europe,
we have approximately 110,600 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis,
representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels.

(6) Digital Cable Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our
digital cable service over our broadband network or through a partner network. We count a subscriber with
one or more digital converter boxes that receives our digital cable service in one premises as just one
subscriber. A Digital Cable Subscriber is not counted as an Analog Cable Subscriber. As we migrate
customers from analog to digital cable services, we report a decrease in our Analog Cable Subscribers equal
to the increase in our Digital Cable Subscribers. As discussed in further detail in note 5 above, Basic Digital
Cable Subscribers are not included in the respective Digital Cable Subscriber counts. Subscribers to digital
cable services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks receive analog cable
services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations.

(7) DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video
programming broadcast directly via a geosynchronous satellite.

(8) MMDS Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video
programming via MMDS.

(9) Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet
services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Our Internet Subscribers exclude
65,900 digital subscriber line (DSL) subscribers within our Austria segment that are not serviced over our
networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections.
In Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Analog and Digital Cable Subscribers without an
incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 66,800 subscribers who have
requested and received this service.

(10) Fixed-line Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that

receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Fixed-line
Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. Our Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers
exclude 48,400 subscribers within our segments in Austria, respectively, that are not serviced over our
networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Analog and Digital Cable Subscribers
without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 2,800 subscribers
who have requested and received this service.

(11) Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers digital cable, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony

services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (partner networks). A partner network RGU is
only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2014,
Switzerland’s partner networks account for 143,600 Customer Relationships, 279,500 RGUs, 107,700
Digital Cable Subscribers, 101,900 Internet Subscribers and 69,900 Fixed-line Telephony Subscribers.

**Additional General Notes to Table:**

Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide fixed-line telephony, broadband internet, data,

video or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office
(SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or
fixed-line telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential
subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service
levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband
communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO
RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count
customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.

Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential

multiple dwelling units and commercial establishments, such as certain commercial and residential multiple
dwelling units in Europe. Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an
area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier
of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates.

While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and

accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and
pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection
experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our
subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported
on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber
statistics based on those reviews.

Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have

completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

**Residential Services**

_Video. Our cable operations offer a full range of video services, including basic and premium programming,_

which can be viewed on the television and, in select markets, through internet connected devices in the home and
whenever there is internet connectivity. We provide advanced service offerings, such as an electronic
programming guide, high definition (HD) channels, digital video recorders (DVR) and HD DVR. In certain
markets, our advance service offerings also include video-on-demand (VoD) and advance next generation set-top
boxes like the multimedia home gateway “Horizon TV”. These services, together with DVR and HD DVR
functionality, give our customers the ability to control when they watch their programming. In several of our
markets, we have enhanced pay-per-view programming on channels we distribute and through VoD. In addition,
we offer select programming in three-dimensional (3D) format to our customers who have 3D capable
televisions. Several of our operations offer television applications (apps) that allow access to programming on a
variety of devices, including laptops, smartphones and tablets.

To receive our digital services, a subscriber must either rent a set-top box from our operators, or purchase

one and obtain a conditional access security card, or a “smart card”, from our operators. Neither a set-top box nor
a smart card is required to receive basic digital television channels in our unencrypted footprints. Accordingly,
where our basic digital television channels are unencrypted, subscribers are able to also watch our basic digital
television channels, provided that they pay the monthly subscription fee for our analog package and have
televisions capable of receiving digital signals. The basic digital television channels in our entire footprints in
Switzerland, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic and Romania are unencrypted as of December 31, 2014. We
may unencrypt the digital versions of our basic analog tier in additional markets in 2015 and future periods.
Regardless of whether basic digital channels are offered on an unencrypted basis, expanded channel packages
and premium channels and services continue to be available for an incremental monthly fee in all of our markets.

In some of our markets, instead of a set-top box, a subscriber may use a common interface plus (CI+)

module to access our encrypted digital services. A CI+ module is a small device (credit card size) that allows
customers with a CI+ enabled television set, who subscribe to, or otherwise have access to, our digital video
service, to view such services without a set-top box. No set-top box, CI+ module or smart card is required to
receive our analog or unencrypted basic digital services.

89


-----

Our cable operations generally offer two or three tiers of digital video programming and audio services.

Subscribers to our basic digital video service pay a fixed monthly fee and generally receive at least 85 video
channels and several audio services. This service also includes VoD access and an electronic programming guide.
In our markets where our basic digital service is not encrypted, the cost of our digital service is the same cost as
our analog services. In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally
offered at an incremental cost equal to or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. For an
additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an
increased number of video channels, including the channels in the basic tier service. A limited number of HD
channels are generally included in our basic tiers of service. Digital subscribers may also subscribe to one or
more packages of premium channels, including additional HD channels. In all digital tiers of service, a subscriber
also has the option for an incremental monthly charge to upgrade the standard digital device to one with DVR or
HD DVR capabilities, which may be rented or purchased. Customers who subscribe to a digital tier generally
receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. Our VoD services, including catch-up
television, are available on a subscription basis or a transaction basis, depending on location and the tier of digital
service selected by the subscriber.

In addition to our digital video services, we offer limited analog services in all of our broadband markets.

Subscribers to our analog video service typically receive 29 to 65 channels of video service, depending on their
location. Subscribers to our digital services also receive the channels available through our analog service. In
Slovakia, we offer a limited number of video channels through MMDS.

Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of

our services (bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in certain markets, mobile services.
Bundled services consist of “double-play” for two services, “triple-play” for three services and “quadruple-play”
for four services.

We tailor our tiers of video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences,

culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings include general entertainment,
sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels. In each of our
markets, we also offer a variety of premium channel packages (such as sports, family and international focus)
and our VoD service provides a wide variety of movies and special events to meet the special interests of our
subscribers. In all of our broadband operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services
and encourage our analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service.

We offer digital video services through DTH satellite in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and

Slovakia. We offer these services through UPC DTH S.á.r.l (UPC DTH), a subsidiary of UPC Holding organized
in Luxembourg, which also has a management arrangement with another subsidiary, FocusSat Romania Srl
(FocusSat), to provide these services in Romania. Similar to our video cable services, we offer a lifeline tier of
service, a basic video tier of service and, for an additional monthly charge, subscribers may upgrade to an
extended tier of service and may subscribe to various premium channel packages.

_Interactive Services. To enhance our customers’ video experience, we offer “Horizon TV”, a next_

generation multimedia home gateway, in Switzerland. Horizon TV is a central media platform that is capable of
distributing video, voice and data content throughout the home and to multiple devices. It has a sophisticated user
interface that enables customers to view linear channels, VoD programming and personal media content and to
pause, replay and record programming. The Horizon TV platform sets up a wireless network that connects the
digital video content available on the television to other devices, such as laptops, smartphones and tablets. It also
integrates access to personal media content, such as photos, music and movies stored in the home network.

The box for Horizon TV has six inbuilt tuners, two of which are dedicated to channel-surfing. This allows

the customer to view programming information while their current program is playing. Also, up to four programs
can be recorded simultaneously and up to four devices can connect to the Horizon TV box at the same time and
view different content. In certain markets, we offer a box for Horizon TV without the recording functionality. For
our multimedia gateway customers, we also offer apps for various services. We intend to (1) expand the
availability of Horizon TV to other markets within our footprint and (2) continue to improve the Horizon TV user
experience with new functionality and software updates.

For our Horizon TV subscribers, we offer apps for various online services (such as YouTube, Facebook,

Picasa and others). The Horizon family of products also includes an online television app for viewing on a
second screen called “Horizon Go” that allows video customers to view linear channels, with many channels

available outside of the home. Horizon Go also offers access to VoD, and, for Horizon TV customers, when in
the home, the second screen devices also act as a remote control. We also have available through Horizon Go the
ability to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on the Horizon TV box at home through an
iOS or Android mobile digital device or an internet web browser. Other iOS and Android apps that are available
allow customers to use their smartphone as an extension of their home phone line.

At December 31, 2014, we had 222,640 Horizon TV subscribers in Switzerland. We are expanding the

Horizon TV experience through cloud TV, including cloud DVR, VoD navigation and advanced applications.
The Horizon TV cloud platform allows users to stream experiences to set-top boxes and CI+ modules. It also
integrates access to personal media content, such as photos, music and movies stored in the home or in the cloud,
enabling access on devices both in and outside the home. In November 2014, we launched this cloud-based
Horizon TV platform in select areas in Poland, followed by a full commercial launch in January 2015. In Poland,
we had over 1,800 Horizon TV subscribers at December 31, 2014.

In addition, we have launched our subscription VoD offering, which we refer to as “MyPrime”. MyPrime

offers customers unlimited streaming access to a library of on-demand content. Each library has been tailored to
the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers. Generally, the
library contains 1,500 movies and 2,000 TV episodes from local and international suppliers such as ABC/Disney,
NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Warner TV and Sony. The MyPrime offering also includes over 500 children’s
episodes. Where available, MyPrime is included with the Horizon TV platform services (or separately as a
premium channel for non-Horizon TV subscribers). We have launched MyPrime in Switzerland, Poland and
Hungary.

_Broadband Internet. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service in all of our broadband_

communications markets. Depending on location, this service includes download speeds ranging from less than 1
Mbps to an ultra high-speed internet service of 500 Mbps in Hungary and Romania. To a select market in
Switzerland, we also have available an ultra high-speed internet service with download speeds of up to 500
Mbps. Our key mass-market package in all of our operations include a download speed of up to 120 Mbps.
Generally, we provide our broadband internet service without any time or data volume restrictions. Our ultra
high-speed internet service is based primarily on Euro DOCSIS 3.0 technology, which is an international
standard that defines requirements for a data transmission over a cable system. Our internet service generally
includes email, address book, parental controls and online audio. We also offer value-added broadband services
through certain of our operations for an incremental charge. These services include security (e.g., anti-virus and
spam protection), online storage and web spaces. In certain of our markets, we offer mobile broadband services
as described under “—Mobile” below.

Our residential subscribers generally access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet

capable devices, including personal computers, at various speeds depending on the tier of service selected. This
standard means of access is changing as we expand our services to offer wireless networks for the home. In
certain of our markets, we are deploying a community WiFi in the home (Community WiFi), which provides a
seamless connectivity experience over WiFi to our customers. The Community WiFi is branded as “Wi-Free” in
Switzerland, Poland, Hungry and Romania. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 1.7 million WiFi
access points in our European footprint. In 2015, through an agreement with Comcast Corporation, our internet
customers will also have access to millions of new WiFi access points in the U.S. and across various European
countries, for no additional costs.

Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem) in the set-top box, and

starting in 2014 the Horizon TV box, of our internet customers. Access is free for our internet customers. The
Community WiFi is created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless
routers. The public channel is a separate network from the secure private network used by the customer within
the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. By using the WiFi modems and the
Horizon TV box, the Community WiFi does not affect the internet speeds of our customers.

In Romania and Switzerland, a subscriber must subscribe to our video service in order to subscribe to our

internet service. In our other markets, our broadband internet service is available on a standalone basis or in
combination with one or more of our other services. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based
on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon
subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine
pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other
factors.

_Telephony. Multi-feature fixed-line telephony services are available through our managed, quality of service_

based voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in all of our broadband communication markets. In
Hungary, we also provide traditional circuit-switched fixed-line telephony services. We pay interconnection fees
to telephony providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from
providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points.

Our fixed-line telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all

of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our fixed-line telephony service includes a
basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the
following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages,
including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager,
unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. In some of our markets, we offer a
phone app that allows our fixed-line telephony customers with smartphones to use their fixed-line call packages.

_Mobile. We offer mobile services, both data and voice, as an MVNO over third-party networks in_

Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary. In Poland we have a small legacy MVNO service that we maintain for those
subscribers. We plan to add MVNO arrangements in certain of our other broadband communication markets.
Switzerland, Austria and Hungary provide their mobile telephony services as full MVNOs through partnerships
with a third-party mobile network operator in their respective footprints. All of these operations lease the third
party’s radio access network and own the core network, including switching, backbone, interconnections, etc.
These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets all mobile services using the core network
without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. We offer our mobile services throughout
Austria. Following an offer of mobile services in select areas of Hungary, we did a full commercial launch of
these services in March 2015. In Switzerland, we offer our mobile service to our customers located within our
footprint who subscribe to at least one of our other products: video, broadband internet or fixed-line telephony.

Where mobile services are available within our operations, subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending

on whether the mobile service is included with our fixed-line telephony service or includes mobile data services
via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or
SMS) and internet or data access. Calls, both within and out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a
postpaid monthly service plan. Our standalone mobile services are primarily on a postpaid basis with customers
subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months, with the
latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In almost all of our markets, subscribers to a double-or tripleplay bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee.

**Business Services**

In addition to our residential services, we offer voice, broadband internet, data, video, wireless and cloud

services to business customers and public sector organizations. Our business services are designed to meet the
specific demands of the business customer. These services differ from residential services in several fundamental
ways, such as bandwidth, service levels, billing, security services and the blending of public and private network
features. Our business customers include SOHO (generally fewer than 10 employees), small business and
medium and large enterprises, as well as on a wholesale basis to other operators. In addition, in some of our
markets, we target specific industry segments, such as financial institutions, health care facilities, education
institutions and government offices, with tailored solutions combining our standard services with value added
features, such as dedicated customer care and enhanced service performance monitoring. We also offer a range of
data, voice and internet services to carriers, internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile operators.

Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide

range of services. These services fall into five broad categories: (1) VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, hosted
private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options, (2) data services for internet access, virtual private
networks Ethernet transport and high capacity point-to-point services, (3) video programming packages and
select channel lineups for targeted industries, (4) wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as WiFi
networks, and (5) value added services, including webhosting, managed security systems and storage and cloud
enabled software.

Our business services are provided to customers at established prices based on the type of services received,

the volume and the duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business market
prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their

92


-----

needs. For more advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For
medium to large business customers, we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These
agreements are generally for a period of one or more years.

**Technology**

In almost all of our markets, our video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted

over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of fiber optics with only the last
part that connects the home to the network composed of coaxial cable. Over 97% of our network allows for twoway communications and is flexible enough to support our current services, as well as new services. In addition,
the capacity available on our network increases as our analog subscribers switch to a digital service. This is
because multiple digital channels can be compressed into the same space as a single analog channel in the
broadcast spectrum. The available space can then be used for other purposes, such as VoD services and high
broadband speeds.

We continue to explore new technologies that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment

experience, such as:

    - recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:

       - increasing the number of nodes in our markets;

       - increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;

       - converting analog channels;

       - bonding additional 3.0 channels; and

       - using digital compression technologies;

    - increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and
multiplexing) to the cloud;

    - enhancing our network to accommodate business services;

    - using wireless technologies to extend our services outside the home;

    - offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smartphones and tablets; and

    - developing and introducing next-generation platforms through multimedia home gateways or online
media sharing and streaming or cloud based video, as well as enhanced next generation user interfaces
for existing set-top boxes.

In addition, we may expand our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network into new market areas.

We deliver our high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our cable network. The cable networks of our

operations are connected to our “aorta” backbone, a tier 1 carrier, which permits us to serve our customers
through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network.

**Supply Sources**

For our video services, we license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from broadcast

and cable programming networks, as well as DTH content providers. For such licenses, we generally pay a
monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis. We generally enter into long-term programming licenses
with volume discounts and marketing support. For on-demand programming and streaming services, we
generally enter into shorter-term agreements. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to
offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for
smartphones and tablets.

We purchase each type of customer premise equipment from a number of different suppliers with at least

two or more suppliers for our high-volume products. Customer premise equipment includes set-top boxes,
modems, CI+ modules, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to
provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment
and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer customers
in our operations with mobile services.

93


-----

We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from

several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber
fee for software licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our fixed-line telephony
services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of
suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on
usage of the services.

who subscribe to the analog service are also able to access our basic digital service, which is unencrypted in the
UPC Cablecom and UPC Austria footprints.

95


-----

Switzerland. UPC Cablecom’s operations are located in 24 of the 26 member states (Cantons) of

Switzerland, including major cities such as Bern, Zürich, Lausanne and Geneva. UPC Cablecom’s basic video
service (digital or analog) is available in any one of three languages (French, German or Italian). At the
beginning of 2013, UPC Cablecom launched Horizon TV and at December 31, 2014, it had 223,000 connected
subscribers. As a complement to its digital video service, UPC Cablecom also offers apps that allow its
subscribers to remotely manage a DVR, view linear channels, replay a linear channel without recording it and
access VoD with a laptop, smartphone or tablet anywhere a broadband or WiFi connection is available.
Beginning in January 2015, UPC Cablecom’s basic digital service is a triple-play package consisting of video,
broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services, plus an app to use the fixed-line telephony service on a
smartphone. In addition, UPC Cablecom has launched a Community WiFi network throughout its footprint.

In each of its digital cable packages, UPC Cablecom includes the functionality for transaction-based

VoD service (depending on location), including catch-up television and pay-per-view services, and HD channels.
Fully integrated in the VoD service is the video library MyPrime, which UPC Cablecom launched in September
2014. MyPrime is included in the extended digital tiers for no additional charge. UPC Cablecom’s basic digital
service is not encrypted. A CI+ module or set-top box in combination with a smart card is, however, required to
view any of UPC Cablecom’s encrypted digital packages with the customer paying the incremental charge over
the digital entry tier’s applicable rate.

For 66% of its video subscribers, UPC Cablecom maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing

associations, and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the
billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units.

UPC Cablecom offers digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony service directly to the

analog cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with
UPC Cablecom. UPC Cablecom has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting
UPC Cablecom to offer some or all of its digital video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony products
directly to those partner network subscribers, UPC Cablecom’s service operating contracts have expanded the
addressable markets for UPC Cablecom’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products
directly to the partner network subscribers, UPC Cablecom pays to the partner network a share of the revenue
generated from those subscribers. UPC Cablecom also provides full or partial analog television signal delivery
services, network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.

Austria. UPC Austria’s cable operations are located in regional clusters encompassing the capital city of

Vienna, the regional capitals of Graz, Innsbruck and Klagenfurt, two smaller cities and the Vorarlberg region.
Three of these cities (Vienna, Wr. Neustadt and Baden), directly or indirectly, own 5% of the local operating
subsidiary of UPC Austria serving the applicable city. UPC Austria’s DSL operations are available in the
majority of Austria, wherever the incumbent telecommunications operator has implemented DSL technology.
UPC Austria’s video service (digital and analog) is available primarily in the German language. Its premium
packages include ethnic channels (such as Serb, Bosnian and Turkish channels), music, adult and international
channels. In addition, through an agreement with Sky Deutschland, UPC Austria offers its digital subscribers a
number of premium channels, including HD channels, from Sky Deutschland. UPC Austria also offers Horizon
Go that allows its customers with double play services of video and broadband internet to access up to 55 to 100
linear channels (depending on tier of service) and VoD programming. UPC Austria offers its broadband internet
service over cable and over DSL.

_Central and Eastern Europe. We also operate cable networks under the UPC brand in Poland (UPC Poland),_

Hungary (UPC Hungary), the Czech Republic (UPC Czech), Romania (UPC Romania) and Slovakia (UPC
Slovakia). VoD service, including catch-up television, is available to our subscribers in Hungary and in major
metropolitan areas in Poland. UPC Hungary, UPC Poland and UPC Romania have each launched apps for no
charge to subscribers that permit them to view the digital channel programming guide, schedule DVR recordings
from any location, and use their smartphones as a television remote control. We also have DTH operations in
most of these countries, which we provide through UPC DTH.

Poland. UPC Poland’s operations are located in regional clusters encompassing nine of the 10 largest cities

in Poland, including the capital city of Warsaw and the cities of Cracow and Katowice. Customers with the
necessary equipment and who have a monthly subscription to UPC Poland’s analog service are also able to
access its basic digital service, which is unencrypted. UPC Poland also offers a catch-up television service and
Horizon Go. UPC Poland launched Horizon TV using the cloud in select areas in November 2014 with a full
commercial launch in January 2015. At December 31, 2014, UPC Poland had over 1,800 connected Horizon TV

96

subscribing to download speeds of at least 30 Mbps.

Hungary. UPC Hungary’s operations are located in 23 major Hungarian towns and cities, including the

capital city of Budapest and the cities of Debrecen, Miskolc, Pécs and Székesfehérvár. For its digital video
subscribers, UPC Hungary offers a CI+ module, which in combination with a smart card, allows the subscriber to
view the digital service without the need for a set-top box. In each of its digital cable packages, UPC Hungary
includes the functionality for transaction-based VoD services. UPC Hungary offers to its subscribers with HD
set-top boxes apps for various online services (such as YouTube, Picasa, Flickr and others). It also offers the
video service MyPrime and the online streaming service HBO Go. HBO Go is available at no additional charge
to UPC Hungary customers who subscribe to the HBO channels. Following an offer of mobile services in select
areas, UPC Hungary undertook a full commercial launch of mobile services as an MVNO in March 2015 and
Community WiFi, which has approximately 280,000 access points in Hungary. UPC Hungary offers its fixed-line
telephony services through circuit-switched fixed-line telephony to subscribers on its twisted copper pair network
and through VoIP over its two-way capable cable network.

The Czech Republic. UPC Czech’s operations are located in cities and towns throughout the Czech

Republic, including Prague, Brno, Ostrava and Plzen. Over 40% of the subscribers to UPC Czech’s digital video
service receive such service through a set-top box with HD or HD DVR functionality. In November 2014, UPC
Czech launched the online video service Horizon Go. It plans to launch Horizon TV based on the cloud in 2015.
UPC Czech offers a lifeline tier and basic tier of digital programming, as well as extended tiers and premium
packages. Approximately 48% of UPC Czech’s digital cable subscribers receive the basic and extended tier
services. UPC Czech’s analog service is offered only in areas where its digital service is not available and
includes a lifeline tier of services.

Romania. UPC Romania’s operations are located primarily in three regional clusters, which include nine of

the 12 largest cities (each with more than 150,000 inhabitants) in Romania, including the capital city of
Bucharest and the cities of Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, Iasi and Constanta. UPC Romania’s video service includes
Romanian terrestrial broadcast channels, selected European satellite programming and other programming. In
November 2014, UPC Romania launched the online video service Horizon Go. In addition to its standard
broadband internet service offerings, UPC Romania also offers a 256 Kbps service at no incremental charge as an
inducement for customers to subscribe to certain services. Its Community WiFi service has approximately
240,000 access points in Romania.

Slovakia. UPC Slovakia’s operations are located in seven regions in Slovakia, including the five largest

cities of Bratislava, Kosice, Presov, Banská Bystrica and Zilina. Besides its video cable services, UPC Slovakia
offers video services in certain areas over its MMDS network. UPC Slovakia offers almost all of the Slovakian
terrestrial, cable and local channels available, selected European satellite and other programming, and audio
channels. The online streaming service HBO Go is available to HBO channel subscribers. Subscribers to UPC
Slovakia’s digital video services may receive such service through a CI+ module in combination with a smart
card without the need for a set-top box. UPC Slovakia’s analog service, which is not available to its MMDS
subscribers, includes a lifeline tier of service.

UPC DTH. UPC DTH, based in Luxembourg, provides DTH services in the countries of the Czech

Republic, Hungary and Slovakia and manages the Romania DTH provider FocusSat. UPC DTH and FocusSat
together provide DTH services to over 780,000 customers. UPC DTH offers a lifeline tier and either directly or
through FocusSat a basic tier, an extended tier and premium channel options, as well as 25 free-to-air (FTA)
television and audio channels. A subscriber to its basic tier may receive 50 to 70 digital video channels
depending on the subscriber’s location. Its premium channel offerings cover a range of interests (such as movies,
adventure, sports, adult and comedy). In 2013, UPC DTH launched a CI+ module offer in the Czech Republic
and Slovakia. The CI+ module will enable its subscribers in the Czech Republic and Slovakia to receive its
signals without a set-top box. DVRs are also available and a subscriber to the extended tier receives 10 to 14 HD
channels depending on the subscriber’s location. In 2014, UPC DTH added HBO Go for its HBO customers in
Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia. For no additional charge, such customers may access their HBO
channels anytime, anywhere on multiple devices.

Subscribers to the DTH services may pay either an annual fee and receive an activation card for the lifeline

tier of video service or pay a monthly fee for a basic or extended tier of service. UPC DTH provides DTH

services to 20% of our total video subscribers in the Czech Republic, 30% of our total video subscribers in
Hungary, 27% of our total video subscribers in Slovakia and, through FocusSat, 28% of our total video
subscribers in Romania.

UPC DTH and FocusSat have agreements with Telenor Satellite Broadcasting for the lease of transponder

space, including expansion capacity, on the Thor satellites. These agreements will expire on December 31, 2017,
unless extended as provided in such agreements. All of UPC DTH’s services are on the Thor satellite system.
UPC DTH offers both standard definition (SD) and HD services to all of its customers in Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia and, through FocusSat, in Romania.

**Competition**

The markets for video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services are highly competitive

and rapidly evolving. In addition, technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely
to continue to increase the number of alternative providers available to our customers. Consequently, our
businesses have faced and are expected to continue to face significant competition in these markets in the
countries in which they operate, including as a result of deregulation. The percentage information in this section
reflects the data for each country regardless of the extent of our footprint in such country and is based on
information from the subscription based website DataXis for the third quarter of 2014. The competition in certain
countries in which we operate is described more specifically after the respective competition overview on video,
broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services.

**_Video Distribution_**

Our businesses compete directly with a wide range of providers of communication and entertainment

services to consumers. Depending upon the country and market, these may include:

    - traditional FTA broadcast television services;

    - DTH satellite service providers;

    - other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including the incumbent
telephony operators, offering (a) DTH satellite services, (b) IPTV over broadband internet connections
using asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) or very high-speed DSL technology (VDSL) or an
enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (c) IPTV over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the
home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is
referred to herein as FTTx), or (d) long-term evolution wireless service, the next generation of ultra
high-speed mobile data, also called “4G” (referred to herein as LTE) services;

    - digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasters, which transmit digital signals over the air providing a
greater number of channels and better quality than traditional analog broadcasting;

    - other cable operators in the same communities that we serve;

    - over-the-top video content aggregators utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet
connections;

    - satellite master antenna television systems, commonly known as “SMATVs”, which generally serve
condominiums, apartment and office complexes and residential developments;

    - MMDS operators; and

    - movie theaters, video stores, video websites and home video products.

Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such

as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events.

We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages in the areas served

by our network. For instance, our cable network allows us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with
real-time television and VoD content at higher speeds and with less data loss than comparable services of other
providers. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide “triple-play” bundled services of broadband
internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network.
Our capacity is dimensioned to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects of
the network can be leveraged at very low incremental cost given that business demand peaks at a time when
consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand.

98


-----

In the countries in which we operate, over 90% of the households have a television. Our principal

competition in the provision of video services in our markets has historically been from traditional FTA
broadcasters; DTH satellite providers in many markets, such as Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where
we compete with long-established satellite platforms; incumbent telecommunications providers using fiber
technology; and cable operators in various markets where portions of our systems have been overbuilt. Mobile
broadband has gained a noticeable share of subscribers, and competition from SMATV or MMDS could also be a
factor. In addition, as accessibility to video content on the internet increases, over-the-top viewing is a
competitive factor. Overall, we are experiencing more and more convergence as customers are increasingly
looking to receive all their media and communication services from one provider at attractive prices. As a result,
our ability to offer triple-play or quadruple-play bundles is a key marketing concept to continue to attract and
retain customers.

Over the last several years, competition has increased significantly from both new entrants and established

competitors using advanced technologies, aggressively priced services and exclusive channel offerings. Our
competitors are also improving their video platforms with next generation set-top boxes. DTT is a significant part
of the competitive market in Europe as a result of a number of different business models that range from full
blown encrypted pay television to FTA television. Similarly, VDSL, which is either provided directly by the
owner of the network or by a third party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of our
markets as are FTTx networks. In all of our markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent
telecommunications operator, whose video strategies include DTH, DTT and IPTV over VDSL and FTTx
networks. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of video, broadband internet and fixed-line
telephony services and, in some countries, a quadruple-play with mobile services, is exerting growing
competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. The providers
of DTH satellite services, particularly in the Central and Eastern European markets, are also significant
competitors. In addition, over-the-top video aggregators are becoming more active in all our markets with their
VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and linear channels from broadcasters. In some
cases, these over-the-top services are provided free-of-charge, or the content library of such services is offered on
an unlimited basis for a monthly fee.

Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers will depend on our continued ability to acquire

appealing program content and third-party programming services on acceptable financial or other terms. Some
competitors, such as Swisscom AG (Swisscom) in Switzerland, have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for
certain popular programs, which limits the opportunities for other providers, including our operations, to offer
such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our
operations have access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies. If
exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for
subscribers on selecting a video service.

Portions of our systems have been overbuilt by FTTx networks, primarily in the Czech Republic, Romania

and Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, in Hungary and Switzerland. Based on research of various
telecommunication publications, including by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and
internal estimates, approximately 65%, 92%, and 73% of our cable networks in the Czech Republic, Romania
and Slovakia, respectively, have been overbuilt by FTTx networks. Also, 12% of our footprint in Hungary and
37% of our footprint in Switzerland are overbuilt by FTTx networks. Although we have extensive FTTx
overbuild in Switzerland, connectivity to the FTTx network is not available at all locations. In addition,
government and quasi-government entities in certain of the countries in which we operate continue to invest in
FTTx networks, creating another source of competition. In order to achieve download speeds of up to 100 Mbps
or greater for customers, incumbent telecommunications operators are increasingly adopting VDSL with
vectoring and bonding technologies as a more cost efficient solution compared to FTTx initiatives.

Our Central and Eastern European markets are also experiencing significant competition from other cable

operators. These cable operators have significantly overbuilt our operations in Poland, Hungary, Romania and
Slovakia. Based on research of various telecommunication publications, including the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, and internal estimates, approximately 42%, 52%, 95% and 47% of our
operations in Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, respectively, are overbuilt by other cable providers.

In most of our Central and Eastern European markets, we also face intense competition from DTH services.

Digi TV, the DTH platform of RCS & RDS S.A. (Digi TV), a Romanian cable, telephony and internet service
provider is targeting our analog cable, MMDS and DTH customers with aggressively priced DTH packages, in
addition to overbuilding portions of our cable network in Hungary and Romania. In the Czech Republic and

99


-----

Slovakia, SkyLink, the brand name of M7 Group SA, a European provider of DTH services, is a DTH competitor
providing aggressively priced packages of video content. The incumbent telecommunications operator in
Romania also operates a competing DTH platform. UPC DTH offers advanced services and functionality,
including DVR and premium content, to most of our Central and Eastern European markets. UPC DTH’s share
of the subscription-based television market is 8% for Hungary, 4% for the Czech Republic, 4% for Slovakia and,
through FocusSat, 5% for Romania.

In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number

of our larger markets have been pricing their DTT, VDSL or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price
of the comparable digital cable service and, in some cases, including DVRs as a standard feature.

To meet the challenges in this competitive environment, we compete on value by offering advanced digital

services, such as DVR functionality, HD, VoD, catch-up television and multi-media gateways. We seek to
compete by accelerating the migration of our customers from analog to digital services, using such advanced
digital features and offering attractive content packages and bundles of services at reasonable prices. HD and
DVRs are an integral part of our digital services in all of our markets and VoD and catch-up television are an
integral part of our digital services in most of our markets. In each of our countries we also tailor our packages to
include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts.
Discounts for bundled services are available in all of our operations. In addition, from time to time, digital
channel offerings are modified by our operations to improve the quality of our programming. We also use the
triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be
leveraged across the portfolio of services. In several of our markets, we have expanded our services to include
mobile voice and data. We also continue to explore new technologies that will enhance our customer’s television
experience. In this regard, to further enhance our digital video services, we have expanded our markets in which
Horizon TV is available, including the recent launch of a cloud-based Horizon TV platform in Poland. We have
also launched our on-line Horizon Go and MyPrime in a number of markets.

_Switzerland. We are the largest cable television provider in Switzerland based on the number of video cable_

subscribers and the sole provider in substantially all of our network area. UPC Cablecom’s video cable services
are available to approximately 64% of the television households in Switzerland and it serves 42% of the total
television market. Our main competitor is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which
provides IPTV services over DSL and FTTx networks to approximately 33% of all television households in
Switzerland. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR functionality, and HD channels, as well as the functionality to
allow remote access to its video services, and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming.
Swisscom’s internet speeds available in its bundled offers, include up to 100 Mbps and up to 300 Mbps in areas
served by its FTTx network. Swisscom continues to aggressively expand its FTTx network to Switzerland
households in our footprint as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its fiber-to-the-home network
in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation agreement
has been reached, Swisscom is building its own fiber-to-the-home network. Outside of urban areas, Swisscom
has announced that it will extend its fiber-to-the-node network by introducing vectoring, which allows Swisscom
to offer speeds comparable to those offered by UPC Cablecom. Due to a small program offering, competition
from terrestrial television in Switzerland is limited, with DTT available primarily along the borders with France
and Italy. DTH satellite services are also limited due to various legal restrictions such as construction and zoning
regulations or rental agreements that prohibit or impede installation of satellite dishes. With respect to
subscribers on partner networks, UPC Cablecom competes with other service providers for the contracts to serve
these subscribers. To compete effectively, UPC Cablecom offers Horizon TV, which combines television,
internet and fixed-line telephony on one device, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming.
As a complement to this service, UPC Cablecom introduced the video service Horizon Go. It also offers
promotional discounts and launched MyPrime in 2014 as an enhancement to its mid-to high-end bundles.

_Austria. In Austria, we are the largest cable television provider based on the number of video cable_

subscribers. UPC Austria’s video cable service is available to approximately 37% of the television households in
Austria and it serves 14% of the total television market. UPC Austria’s primary competition is from FTA
television received via satellite and DTT services by the public broadcaster. Competition from the VDSL
services provided by the incumbent telecommunications operator, Telekom Austria AG (A1) (Telekom Austria),
and from DTH satellite services offered by Sky Deutschland also continue to increase. At various times, Telekom
Austria offers promotional discounts for its VDSL service, which includes advanced features, such as VoD, when
taken as part of either a double- or triple-play bundle. To compete effectively, UPC Austria offers its basic digital
service unencrypted. It also offers promotional discounts for new customers and in 2014, realigned its bundle
offers. In addition, it launched Horizon Go and increased internet speeds for its core triple-play bundle to a top
speed of up to 250 Mbps.

_Central and Eastern Europe. We are the largest cable television provider in Poland based on the number of_

video cable subscribers. UPC Poland’s video cable services are available to approximately 20% of the television
households in Poland and it serves 9% of the total television market. In providing video services, UPC Poland
competes primarily with DTH service providers, including the largest DTH providers, Cyfrowy Polsat SA and
NC+ platform (owned by the Vivendi Group). Cyfrowy Polsat SA and NC+ serve 27% and 16%, respectively, of
the television households in Poland. The DTH service provider Orange Poland, a subsidiary of France Telecom
S.A., is another significant competitor. In addition, UPC Poland competes with other cable operators with tripleplay services, who have overbuilt portions of UPC Poland’s operations. One of these companies is Vectra SA,
which offers aggressively priced double- and triple-play bundles. To enhance its competitive position, UPC
Poland launched MyPrime as an additional service in its extended tier video services. It also realigned its video
offers with additional HD channels and launched Horizon Go. Then in January 2015, after a limited offer in
select markets, it launched the Horizon TV cloud platform throughout its footprint.

UPC Hungary’s video cable service is available to approximately 42% of the television households in

Hungary and it serves 17% of the total television market in Hungary. Our subsidiary, UPC DTH, also provides
satellite services in Hungary, in competition with other DTH providers. One of these, Digi TV, is an aggressive
competitor. Digi TV’s DTH services can reach all of UPC Hungary’s cable service area, as well as UPC DTH’s
service area, and it has overbuilt portions of UPC Hungary’s cable service areas with its own cable network. As a
DTH provider, Digi TV offers more HD channels, including key sports channels, than UPC DTH. UPC Hungary
also faces competition from the incumbent telecommunications company Magyar Telekom, a subsidiary of
Deutsche Telekom. Magyar Telekom offers a VDSL service, including a VoD service, to its internet subscribers.
With its ability to offer bundled triple-play and quadruple-play services, including its DTH video content,
Magyar Telekom is a significant competitor. To meet such competition, UPC Hungary emphasizes its
competitively priced bundles, which have been enhanced with increased broadband speeds of up to 500 Mbps
with up to 120 Mbps or 240 Mbps included in its core bundle offers. In 2014, it launched the video service
MyPrime and for its HBO customers the on-line streaming service HBO Go. Of the television households in
Hungary, 8% subscribe to Digi TV’s DTH service, 14% subscribe to Digi TV’s cable service and 20% subscribe
to Magyar Telekom’s DTH or VDSL service. UPC DTH serves 7% of the television households in Hungary with
its DTH service.

With the discontinuation of FTA analog services in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, DTH services have

increased significantly in popularity, with M7 Group SA (SkyLink) being the main provider. This company
provides DTH services to approximately 30% and 26% of the television households in the Czech Republic and
Slovakia, respectively. As in Hungary, Digi TV is also an aggressive competitor in the Czech Republic and
Romania. Digi TV provides DTH services to 5% and 17% of the television households in the Czech Republic
and Romania, respectively. In Slovakia, we compete with the DTH service provider, Slovak Telekom a.s., a
subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, which offers exclusive sports channels and is expanding its DTH network to
cover not only Slovakia but other Central and Eastern European countries as well. In Slovakia, it serves 20% of
the television households. UPC DTH provides DTH services to 2%, 4% and 3% of the television households in
the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, respectively. To stay competitive, UPC DTH offers prepaid DTH
services in the Czech Republic, as well as a prepaid product through FocusSat in Romania. Also, FocusSat has
enhanced the channel offering in Romania, including the addition of non-exclusive broadcasting rights for
domestic football league. In Romania, competition also comes from DTH services offered by Rom Telecom SA,
the incumbent telecommunications company, with 11% of the total television households.

Of the television households in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, 10%, 12% and 8%,

respectively, subscribe to our video cable service. Our cable services are available to the television households in
each of these countries as follows: 30% in the Czech Republic, 33% in Romania and 22% in Slovakia. In
addition to its DTH services in Romania, Digi TV continues to overbuild portions of our cable network with its
own cable network. UPC Czech competes with the incumbent telephone company’s VDSL service and several
other operators that provide DTH services and a number of local ISPs that provide IPTV services over FTTx
networks. Providers of IPTV services over FTTx networks can reach approximately 65% of the households
passed by our cable network in the Czech Republic. Of the television households in Romania, 30% subscribe to
Digi TV’s cable service. In Slovakia, a number of ISPs make video services available to a majority of the homes
passed by our cable networks. In particular, Slovak Telekom and Orange Slovensko a.s., a subsidiary of France
Telecom S.A., have overbuilt homes passed by our cable network with their FTTx networks and offer triple-play
packages through these networks.

FTA broadcasters are also significant competitors in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia. Subscribers in

these countries tend to be more price sensitive than in other European markets. In particular, almost 100% of the

101


-----

Czech Republic can receive DTT for free or a comprehensive satellite service for a minimal recurring monthly
fee. To address such sensitivity and meet competition, our operations in Central and Eastern Europe offer
enhanced digital services, such as HD channel offerings and, in certain markets, MyPrime, Horizon Go and
expanded VoD services. In addition, all of these operations have realigned their bundle offers to include
increased broadband internet speeds in their triple-play bundles ranging from up to 240 Mbps in the Czech
Republic to 500 Mbps in Hungary and Romania. Promotional discounts are available, particularly on bundled
options. Also, CI+ cards for DTH only products are available in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia.

**_Internet_**

With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly

evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and
cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors
include both fixed-line broadband internet services using DSL or FTTx and wireless broadband internet services,
in a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive computer-based services,
data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With technological developments,
competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies has become significant. Recently,
competitors have started offering high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks in certain of our markets. In
addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are becoming more prevalent. We are also seeing intense
competition from mobile carriers that offer mobile data cards allowing a laptop user to access the carrier’s
broadband wireless data network with varying speeds and pricing.

Our strategy is speed leadership, including increasing the maximum speed of our connections, offering

varying tiers of service and varying prices and offering a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of
value added services. In most of our operations we have launched new bundling strategies, including speeds of
120 Mbps or more at mass market price points and ultra high-speed internet with speeds of generally up to 250
Mbps (240 Mbps in the Czech Republic) and in select markets up to 500 Mbps to compete with VDSL and FTTx
initiatives. The focus continues to be on high-end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and
allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the
technical capabilities of Euro DOCSIS 3.0 technology, we can compete with local FTTx initiatives and create a
competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures on a national level and LTE initiatives as they expand to
a national level.

Our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using

various DSL-based technologies both by the incumbent phone companies and third parties. The introduction of
cheaper and ever faster fixed-line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this
market. Wireless broadband services, such as LTE, are also taking a foothold in a number of countries using
high-speed mobile networks and high-speed downlink packet access systems.

_Switzerland and Austria. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services,_

with an estimated market share of 54% of all broadband internet customers, and is our primary competitor.
Swisscom internet customers have access to its video content free of charge through its internet portal. It is also
expanding its FTTx network, through which it can offer download speeds of up to 300 Mbps and recently
launched its 1 Gbps offer to customers on its new FTTx network. Swisscom FTTx network reaches over
1.0 million homes and it plans to reach over 2.3 million homes by the end of 2015. The next significant
competitor is Sunrise Communications AG with 9% of broadband internet customers. Sunrise Communications
AG offers download speeds of up to 100 Mbps. UPC Cablecom serves 21% of broadband internet subscribers in
Switzerland. UPC Cablecom increased its download speeds to 250 Mbps in early 2014 and seeks to distinguish
itself through competitively priced bundled offerings, including digital video, fixed-line telephony services and
its ultra high-speed internet services. It is also expanding its Community WiFi network and offers ultra highspeed internet with download speeds of up to 500 Mbps in select markets.

UPC Austria’s largest competitor with respect to broadband internet services is the incumbent

telecommunications company, Telekom Austria, with approximately 60% of the broadband internet subscribers
in Austria. In addition, Telekom Austria is expanding its DSL network and planning to use VDSL technology
with vectoring to increase its download speeds to up to 70 Mbps. Currently, it offers download speeds of up to 30
Mbps and up to 100 Mbps in select areas. UPC Austria’s share of such market is 19%. The mobile broadband
services of Telekom Austria are also a competitive factor. Telekom Austria is the largest mobile broadband
provider serving 42% of the mobile broadband subscribers that use LTE services. In addition, UPC Austria faces
competition from LLU and other mobile broadband operators. As a result, the competition in the broadband
internet market is intense. Competitors in the Austrian broadband internet market are focusing on speed and

102


-----

pricing to attract customers. UPC Austria uses its ultra high-speed internet services with competitively priced
bundles and promotional discounts to encourage customers from other providers to switch to UPC Austria’s
services.

_Central and Eastern Europe. In Central and Eastern Europe, our principal competitors are DSL operators_

and cable companies that are overbuilding our cable network. In Poland, our principal competitors are Orange
Poland and Vectra SA, both of which offer download speeds of up to 300 Mbps in parts of UPC Poland’s
footprint. In Hungary, the primary competitors are the incumbent telecommunications company, Magyar
Telekom and Digi TV. In addition, in all of our Central and Eastern European operations we face increased
competition from mobile broadband operators. Download speeds are also a competitive factor, with competitors
enhancing their networks to increase their available download speeds. In all of our Central and Eastern European
markets, we are using our ultra high-speed internet service to attract and retain customers. In addition,
promotional discounts are a big part of our internet service offerings, as well as with our competitors.

**_Fixed-Line Telephony and Mobile Services_**

The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature. Changes in market share are driven by the

combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled
offerings. With respect to fixed-line telephony services, our businesses compete against the incumbent
telecommunications operator in each country. These operators have substantially more experience in providing
fixed-line telephony and mobile services, greater resources to devote to the provision of fixed-line telephony
services and long-standing customer relationships. In addition, we compete with other VoIP operators offering
service across broadband lines and with mobile telephony providers. Over-the-top telephony is also becoming a
competitive factor. In many countries, our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers,
FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers.

Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is increasing due to market

trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile
telephony, and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and other
regulatory action, such as general price competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice
services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. We seek to compete on
pricing as well as product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to make and receive calls
from their fixed-line call packages on smartphones. We also offer varying plans to meet customer needs and
various bundle options with our digital video and internet services. In addition, we offer mobile voice and data
services in Switzerland, Austria and in select markets in Hungary. With consumers increasingly moving towards
mobile services, we continue to explore opportunities to offer mobile services in our other operations and
mobility applications to our other services.

Our fixed-line and mobile telephony businesses are generally small compared to the existing business of the

incumbent telephone company. The incumbent telephone companies remain our key competitors but mobile
operators and other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines are also significant competitors in
these markets. Generally, we expect telephony markets to remain extremely competitive.

Our fixed-line telephony strategy in Europe is focused around value leadership, and we position our services

as “anytime” or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans includes a variety of options designed to meet
the needs of our subscribers. Such options include unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited
off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also use our bundled
offerings to help promote our telephony services.

In Switzerland, we are the largest VoIP service provider, but Swisscom is the dominant fixed-line telephony

service provider. Sunrise Communications AG, which offers carrier pre-select services, is also a strong
competitor. Each of these competitors also operate their own mobile telephony service and include their mobile
products in bundles with fixed-line services. In Austria, we serve our subscribers with VoIP over our cable
network, circuit-switched telephony services and DSL technology service over LLU. To meet the competition for
fixed-line services, UPC Cablecom enhanced its portfolio with attractive bundle options as well as standalone
plans with free minutes either nationally or internationally and offers mobile services, including a phone app that
allows smartphone users make calls on their fixed network plan. The market share of the fixed-line telephony
market for UPC Cablecom is 13%.

103


-----

In our other European markets, the incumbent telephone companies dominate the telephony market. Most of

the fixed-line competition to the incumbent telephone operators in these countries is from entities that provide
carrier pre-select or wholesale line rental services. We also compete with ISPs that offer VoIP services and
mobile operators. Given the increased relevance of the mobile market, we have launched mobile services as an
MVNO in Austria and plan to expand these services to our other markets. To gain market share, we promote our
VoIP telephony service offerings in almost all of our European markets and in some markets we have enhanced
our telephony services through unlimited calling options.

**Regulatory Matters**

**_Overview_**

Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of

the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some
significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the EU.

Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including

conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or
dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could lead to
increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our
operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other
access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to
comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,

Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland,
Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the U.K. are the Member States of the EU. As such,
these countries are required to harmonize certain of their laws with certain EU rules. In addition, other EU rules
are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at the national level. Certain EU rules are
also applicable across the European Economic Area, whose Member States are the EU Member States (excluding
Croatia) as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

In the broadcasting and communications sectors, there has been extensive EU-level legislative action. As a

result, most of the markets in which our businesses operate have been significantly affected by the regulatory
framework that has been developed by the EU. Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the EU
and is not part of the European Economic Area, is discussed separately below, as well as regulation in certain
Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may have a material impact on our business.

**_EU Communications Regulation_**

The body of EU law that deals with communications regulation consists of a variety of legal instruments and

policies (collectively referred to as the Regulatory Framework). The key elements of the Regulatory Framework
are various legal measures, which we refer to as the Directives, that require Member States to harmonize their
laws, as well as certain regulations that have direct effect without any specific adoption at the national level.

The Regulatory Framework primarily seeks open communications services markets within Europe. It

harmonizes the rules within the EU for the establishment and operation of electronic communications networks,
including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communications
services, such as telephony, internet and, to some degree, television services.

On December 18, 2009, the Official Journal of the EU published revisions to the Regulatory Framework.

These revisions should have been transposed into the laws of the Member States before May 25, 2011, although
in practice, this process is still ongoing in certain Member States. Despite their limited nature, certain changes to
the Regulatory Framework will affect us. For example, some new powers have been given to national regulators,
such as the right to mandate access to ducts without finding operators or service providers to have “Significant
Market Power” (defined below). This power, in particular, could require us to open our ducts to competitors and
not allow us to make use of all capacity in our ducts for our own needs, or could mean we get access to ducts of
third parties instead of building our own ducts. Additionally, the revisions to the Regulatory Framework grant
enhanced powers to Member States to impose transparency obligations and quality of service requirements on
ISPs, which may restrict our flexibility in respect of our broadband services.

-----

Certain key provisions included in the current Regulatory Framework are set forth below. This description is

not intended to be a comprehensive description of all regulation in this area.

_Licensing and Exclusivity. The Regulatory Framework requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on_

communication networks and services in their territory and allow operators into their markets based on a simple
registration. The Regulatory Framework sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on
communication networks and services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for
universal service or for the costs of regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer
protection rules, “must carry” obligations, provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and
access obligations.

_Significant Market Power. Certain of the obligations allowed by the Regulatory Framework apply only to_

operators or service providers with “Significant Market Power” in a relevant market. For example, the provisions
of the Access Directive allow EU Member States to mandate certain access obligations only for those operators
and service providers that are deemed to have Significant Market Power. For purposes of the Regulatory
Framework, an operator or service provider will be deemed to have Significant Market Power where, either
individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position of significant economic strength affording it the power to
behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, customers and consumers.

As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Regulatory Framework, each Member State’s

National Regulatory Authority (NRA) is required to analyze certain markets predefined by the EU Commission
to determine if any operator or service provider has Significant Market Power. Until November 2007, there were
18 such markets but then the EU Commission adopted a new recommendation reducing the list of predefined
markets to seven, subject to periodic review. This adjusted recommendation led to a reduction in regulation.
Some NRAs, however, continue to maintain their analysis of some of the markets from the original list or
perform analysis of markets not listed in the recommendation which requires the NRA to prove that additional
requirements, the so called three-criteria test, are met. In October 2014, the EU adjusted the recommendation by
removing the telephony markets and combining the wholesale broadband access markets.

NRAs might seek to define us as having Significant Market Power in any of these predefined markets or

they may define and analyze additional markets. In the event that we are found to have Significant Market Power
in any particular market, an NRA could impose certain conditions on us. Under the Regulatory Framework, the
EU Commission has the power to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence
thereof), which power also applies with respect to market definition, in any market, regardless of whether it is a
market predefined by the EU Commission or an additional market defined by an NRA. We have been found to
have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market
Power are possible. In particular, we have been found to have Significant Market Power in the termination of
calls on our network.

_Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is_

harmonized by the Regulatory Framework. Member States are allowed to impose on certain operators under their
jurisdiction reasonable must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast
channels. Such obligations are required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be
proportionate and transparent and be subject to periodic review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all
European markets in which we operate. In some cases, these obligations go beyond what we believe is allowable
under the Regulatory Framework. To date, however, the EU Commission has taken very limited steps to enforce
EU law in this area, leaving intact must carry obligations in certain Member States that are in excess of what we
believe to be allowed, and we do not expect the EU Commission or the Member States to curtail such obligations
in the foreseeable future.

_Net Neutrality/Traffic Management. Other current regulatory debates at the EU and national level include net_

neutrality/traffic management, as well as responsibilities for ISPs on illegal content or activities on the internet.
With respect to net neutrality/traffic management, the EU Commission confirmed in April 2011 that no additional
EU regulation is needed to preserve net neutrality. The EU Commission made this decision after concluding that the
existing provisions of the Regulatory Framework on consumer transparency and the ability of regulators to impose a
minimum quality of service on an operator should be given time to be tested by Member States. In December 2011,
the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), the joint body of European
telecommunications regulators, published non-binding guidelines on net neutrality and transparency. BEREC
believes that transparency and the ability for end-users to easily switch providers is vital and recommends that
operators should provide clear end-user information about service limitations and actual speeds.

105


-----

While the EU has not imposed net neutrality regulation to date, it does require operators to provide clear and

transparent information to customers on traffic management practices and service quality. In addition, new
measures have been proposed as part of the EU’s Telecoms Single Market proposal, which would prohibit
blocking and throttling of internet traffic, with the exception of congestion management. The proposals also
support development of specialized, managed services delivering enhanced Quality of Service levels by ISPs, in
addition to the continued delivery of best-effort internet services for all. There is significant pressure, however, to
restrict the use of specialized services, which could compromise our ability to manage the content streams on our
network. Negotiations between Member States are in their infancy and we currently expect these negotiations to
be completed in the first half of 2015. The final outcome of this debate and its impact on our businesses is
difficult to predict.

On September 11, 2013, the EU Commission proposed a partial reform to the Regulatory Framework in its

proposed regulation on the European single market for electronic communications. Under EU law, a regulation,
unlike a Directive, is required to be implemented into national law without interpretation by the respective
national government. This proposal is a substantial reform to the 2009 Regulatory Framework, notably in how
regulatory powers for licensing, spectrum and consumer protection are divided between NRAs, BEREC and the
EU Commission. The proposal does not, however, modify the Regulatory Framework for mandating access
obligations on operators with Significant Market Power. With respect to broadband services, the proposal permits
ISPs to charge content or application service providers for carriage in return for new prohibitions to the use of
traffic management to block, slow down or degrade services or applications. There are also modifications to the
rules on consumer protection that extend the circumstances under which subscribers can terminate their contracts
without cost, which may restrict our flexibility in respect of our bundled service offerings. The proposed
regulation is subject to approval by the European Parliament and by Member States in the European Council.
While most of the proposals have not obtained the support of Member States in Council, as of January 2015,
Member States have indicated they are willing to reach an agreement on reform of the roaming proposals and on
a pan-European wide approach to net neutrality. A formal position among the 28 Member States may be reached
by the end of February 2015, after which Member States in Council must negotiate their final position with the
European Parliament before the measures can become EU law. Final adoption of these measures, if any, is not
likely to occur before the second half of 2015.

**_EU Broadcasting Law_**

Although the distribution of video channels by a cable operator is within the scope of the Regulatory

Framework, the activities of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of EU law, in particular the
Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS). Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception
within an EU Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to AVMS, however, EU
Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another EU Member State to
be freely transmitted within their territory so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state.
This is referred to as the country of origin principle. Under AVMS, the country of origin principle applies also to
non-linear services, such as VoD. Accordingly, we should be able, if we so elect, to offer our own VoD services
across the European Economic Area based on the regulation of the country of origin. As a result, we could
structure our business to have a single regulatory regime for all of our VoD services offered in Europe. In
addition, when we offer third party VoD services on our network, it should be the business of the third party, in
its capacity as provider of the services, and not us as the local distributor, that is regulated in respect of these
services.

Although Member States were obligated to transpose the requirements of AVMS into national law, and this

has generally been completed, the practical effect is still not clear. Uncertainty still remains about the proper
treatment of VoD from a practical perspective. Thus, there can be no assurance that the requirements on VoD
will, in fact, operate in the manner described above in any individual Member State. As a result, we may face
inconsistent and uncertain regulation of our VoD service in Europe.

AVMS also establishes quotas for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made

by European producers who are independent of broadcasters.

**_Other European Level Regulation_**

In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with

both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data protection, data retention and
electronic commerce. Many of these regimes are, or will be, reviewed at the EU level.

106


-----

Our operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition

and on consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the EU level. For example, while our operating
companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted
to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service,
such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products
included in the bundled packages.

The EU Commission is imposing more mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions

regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been
participating in discussions and studies regarding energy consumption with the EU Commission and with experts
working on their behalf. In addition, we are working with suppliers of our digital set-top boxes to lower power
consumption, as well as looking at possibilities through software to lower the power consumption of the existing
fleet of digital set-top boxes. We also worked with a large group of companies to create a voluntary agreement on
set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation. The EU Commission formally recognized this
voluntary agreement as a valid alternative to regulation on November 22, 2012. Nevertheless, legislation in this
area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy in
customer homes.

Pursuant to an EU regulation on standby power effective January 7, 2010 (the Standby Regulation), many

devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode unless it is inappropriate to have either
such mode on the device. For this purpose, our set-top boxes and certain other equipment are equipped with an
off switch. Beginning in January 2013, the Standby Regulation imposed further requirements on power
management on certain devices we purchase and/or develop, which devices, namely the Horizon TV set-top box
and any future set-top boxes, must comply with such requirements, unless it can be argued such further
requirements are inappropriate. These additional requirements have necessitated additional software

developments for our equipment and reduce the functionality of our equipment assuming the equipment’s default
setting is maintained.

Furthermore in August 2013, the EU Commission issued an amendment to the Standby Regulation called

Networked Standby (No 801/2013), which became effective as of January 1, 2015, with the aim of regulating,
among others, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called
Networked Standby mode. As is the case with the Standby Regulation, these additional requirements may have
an impact on our costs and the customer experience.

As part of the EU’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of

analog television has been approved for mobile broadband use beginning January 1, 2013. This spectrum, known
as the “digital dividend”, is in the 700 – 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum will become
available will vary among the European countries in which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may
interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to: (1) avoid using certain
frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks, or
(3) change the equipment which we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum
Policy Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT,
to avoid harmful interference. As a result, we are in on-going discussions with relevant Member States and the
EU Commission to be included in LTE mobile trials in order to develop mitigation techniques and to engage
NRAs to launch regulatory dialogs with equipment manufacturers and mobile operators to develop co-existing
networks. We have also requested Member States and the EU Commission to prepare comprehensive national
impact assessments when spectrum conditions are changed to ensure that the costs to prevent interference
between the various services are balanced.

**_Switzerland_**

Switzerland has a regulatory system which partially reflects the principles of the EU, but otherwise is

distinct from the European regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act

(Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and
television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television, however, are regulated under the
Radio and Television Act (Radio und Fernsehgesetz). In addition, the Competition Act and the Act on Price
Surveillance are potentially relevant to our business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home
devices, the Energy Act and the revised Energy Ordinance have been applicable since January 2010 to television
set-top boxes as described below.

107


-----

Under the Telecommunications Act, any provider of telecommunications services needs to register with the

Federal Office of Communications. Dominant providers have to grant access to third parties, including LLU
access. But this access regulation is restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore,
such unbundling obligations do not apply to UPC Cablecom and other cable operators. Also, any dominant
provider has to grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this
time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard. All operators are obliged to provide
interconnection and have to ensure interoperability of services.

The Federal Council has suggested that the current Telecommunications Act be revised in two steps. First,

the Federal Council plans to introduce measures to allow for easier access to the incumbent’s network, better
consumer protection and some measures to decrease roaming fees. Second, the Federal Council plans to
introduce an efficient access regime to the Swisscom network by introducing ex officio rights for the Federal
Communications Commission and an ex-ante regime, regulate the roaming prices and improve the consumer and
youth protection rules. This second step is not expected to start before 2018. In addition, it is expected that the
conditions for a national broadband rollout will be improved by introducing access obligations to the ducts of
local utilities.

Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, cable network operators are obliged

to distribute certain programs that contribute in a particular manner to media diversity. The Federal Government
and the Federal Office of Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed in analog
without the cable operator being entitled to compensation. A new Radio and Television ordinance became
effective August 1, 2012, which allows cable operators to decrease the number of obligatory channels to be
broadcasted in analog. A departmental ordinance was published which eliminates this regime for all foreign
broadcasters as of June 1, 2013, and all other such regulation as of January 1, 2015. Additionally, there is no
legal obligation to broadcast digital and analog in parallel as long as the digital offer is comparable to analog and
does not force customers to incur additional costs.

UPC Cablecom’s retail customer prices are subject to review by the Swiss Price Regulator. In October 2012,

UPC Cablecom announced an agreement with the Swiss Price Regulator pursuant to which UPC Cablecom will
make certain changes to its service offerings in exchange for progressive increases in the price of its basic cable
connection. In this regard, (1) effective November 1, 2012, UPC Cablecom began offering a basic tier of digital
television channels on an unencrypted basis in its footprint and (2) effective January 3, 2013, for video
subscribers who pay the required upfront activation fee, UPC Cablecom has made available, at no additional
monthly charge, a 2 Mbps internet connection, which was an increase from the previously-offered 300 Kbps
internet connection. In addition, the monthly price for a cable connection increased by CHF 0.90 ($0.91)
effective January 1, 2013 and a further increase of CHF 0.60 ($0.60) took effect on January 1, 2014. UPC
Cablecom is currently disputing whether or not such price regulation is still applicable.

Effective October 1, 2014, the Federal Council proposed a new regulation imposing power thresholds for

set-top boxes. There are some exemptions and transition periods which apply in the short term to the set-top
boxes we import into Switzerland. The Swiss regulation may not be in line with EU regulation, and it may be
reconsidered as Switzerland tries to align itself with EU norms. If, however, such regulation remains in force, it
may have an adverse effect on the business of UPC Cablecom as UPC Cablecom may face restrictions regarding
the import of set-top boxes.

**Real Property**

We lease the facilities necessary for the operation of our business, including office space, technical support

and engineering space, customer service space, network center space and other property necessary for our
operations. We believe that our facilities meet our present needs and that our properties are generally well
maintained and suitable for their intended use. We believe that we have sufficient space to satisfy the demand for
our products in the foreseeable future, but we maintain flexibility to move certain operations to alternative
premises.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2014, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately

12,108 full-time equivalent employees, certain of whom belong to organized unions and works councils. Certain
of our subsidiaries also use contract and temporary employees, which are not included in this number, for various
projects. We believe that our employee relations are good.

**THE ISSUER**

The Issuer is an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability. The Issuer

was incorporated on February 1, 2011 under the Companies Law (2010 Revision) of the Cayman Islands with
company registration number 251438. The registered office of the Issuer is at PO Box 1093, Queensgate House,
Grand Cayman, KY1-1102, Cayman Islands.

The authorized share capital of the Issuer is $50,000 divided into 50,000 shares of a par value of $1.00 each,

250 of which have been issued. All of the issued shares of the Issuer (the “Shares”) are fully-paid and are held by
the Share Trustee under the Declaration of Trust. The Shares are subject to the Share Charge. Pursuant to the
Declaration of Trust, the Share Trustee holds the Shares in trust until the Termination Date (as defined in the
Declaration of Trust) and may only dispose or otherwise deal with the Shares with the approval of the Trustee or
the Security Agent for so long as there are any Notes outstanding or the Share Charge is subsisting. Prior to the
Termination Date, the trust is an accumulation trust, but the Share Trustee has power, with the consent of the
Trustee or the Security Agent, to benefit the holders of the Notes or Qualified Charities (as defined in the
Declaration of Trust) or the Trustee or the Security Agent. It is not anticipated that any distribution will be made
while any Note is outstanding. Following the Termination Date, the Share Trustee will wind up the trust and
make a final distribution to charity. The Share Trustee has no beneficial interest in, and derives no benefit (other
than its fee for acting as share trustee) from, its holding of the Shares. The Notes are the obligations of the Issuer
alone and not the Share Trustee.

The Issuer has been formed as a special purpose financing company for the primary purpose of facilitating

the offering of the Notes and the proceeds from the Notes will be loaned by the Issuer to UPC Financing pursuant
to the Finco Loans. Prior to the offering of the Notes, the Issuer did not engage in any business. Upon completion
of this offering of Notes, the Issuer’s only material assets will be the Finco Loans advanced in connection with
the offering of the Notes and its rights under certain related agreements. The Issuer is wholly dependent on
payments by UPC Financing on the Finco Loans in order to service its obligations under the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Holders of the Notes have limited recourse to the Issuer, as payments under the Notes are limited to the_
_amount of certain payments received by the Issuer under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the_
_related agreements”. The Issuer’s only material liabilities will be under the Notes, although it may issue_
additional notes under the Indenture in the future. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants”. The Issuer
has no material business operations, no direct subsidiaries and no employees.

Although UPC Holding and its subsidiaries have no equity or voting interest in the Issuer, the Finco Loans

creates a variable interest in the Issuer for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by
U.S. GAAP. As such, UPC Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding, will be required by the
provisions of U.S. GAAP to consolidate the Issuer following the issuance of the Notes. Accordingly, following
the issuance of the Notes, the Finco Loans will be eliminated through the consolidation of the Issuer within UPC
Holding’s consolidated financial statements. See “Risk Factors—Holders of the Notes have limited recourse to
_the Issuer, as payments under the Notes are limited to the amount of certain payments received by the Issuer_
_under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the related agreements”._

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OF UPC HOLDING**

**General**

UPC Holding has various related-party transactions with certain of Liberty Global’s subsidiaries. These

related-party transactions are reflected in the related-party revenue, operating expenses, SG&A expenses,
allocated share based compensation expense, fees and allocations, net, interest income and interest expense in the
December 31, 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements.

In connection with the Corporate Entities Transfer and Liberty Global’s internal reorganizations of its

broadband and wireless communications businesses in Europe, Liberty Global will be changing the processes it
uses to charge fees and allocate costs and expenses from one subsidiary to another, which, as further described
below, will impact the calculation of the “consolidated EBITDA” metric specified by UPC Holding’s debt
agreements. This new methodology (the “2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology”), which will be
implemented during the first quarter of 2015, is intended to ensure that Liberty Global continues to allocate its
central and administrative costs to its borrowing groups on a fair and rational basis. The implementation of the
2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology will be effected through the Corporate Entities Transfer and will
result in future decreases to UPC Holding’s operating and SG&A expenses and increases to related-party fees
and allocations. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, Liberty Global Services II and Liberty Global
Operations, along with certain other subsidiaries of Liberty Global, will charge fees and allocate costs and
expenses to UPC Holding and other Liberty Global subsidiaries, as appropriate. Subject to the specific terms
contained in the UPC Holding debt agreements, the implementation of the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation
Methodology will impact the calculation of UPC Holding’s EBITDA metric as the amount of related-party fees
and allocations that is included in UPC Holding’s EBITDA metric will change. In this regard, the components of
related-party fees and allocations that are deducted to arrive at UPC Holding’s EBITDA metric in 2015 and
future periods will be based on (i) the amount and nature of costs incurred by the allocating Liberty Global
subsidiaries during the period, (ii) the allocation methodologies in effect during the period and (iii) the size of the
overall pool of entities that are charged fees and allocated costs, such that changes in any of these factors would
likely result in changes to the amount of related-party fees and allocations that will be deducted to arrive at UPC
Holding’s EBITDA metric in future periods. For example, to the extent that another of Liberty Global’s
subsidiary borrowing groups were to acquire (sell) an operating entity, and assuming no change in the total costs
incurred by the allocating entities, the fees charged and the costs allocated to UPC Holding would decrease
(increase).

**Related Party Transactions Impacting UPC Holding’s Operating Results**

**_General_**

UPC Holding charges fees and allocates costs and expenses to Liberty Global and certain other Liberty

Global subsidiaries and Liberty Global and certain Liberty Global subsidiaries outside of the UPC Holding
borrowing group charge fees and allocate costs and expenses to UPC Holding. Depending on the nature of these
related-party transactions, the amount of the charges or allocations may be based on (i) UPC Holding’s estimated
share of the underlying costs, (ii) UPC Holding’s estimated share of the underlying costs plus a mark-up or
(iii) commercially-negotiated rates. Through June 30, 2014, UPC Holding’s related-party operating and SG&A
expenses and UPC Holding’s related-party fees and allocations generally were based on its estimated share of the
applicable estimated costs (including personnel-related and other costs associated with the services provided)
incurred by UPC Holding, Liberty Global and the other Liberty Global subsidiaries. The estimated amounts
charged were reviewed and revised on an annual basis, with any differences between the revised and estimated
amounts recorded in the period identified, generally the first quarter of the following year. The revisions to
reflect the actual costs underlying UPC Holding’s related-party fees and allocations for 2013, 2012 and 2011
amounted to increases (decreases) of €15.3 million, €2.2 million and (€0.7 million), respectively, in UPC
Holding’s net billings to Liberty Global and certain other Liberty Global subsidiaries, which amounts were
recorded during the first half of 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The revisions to reflect actual costs for UPC
Holding’s related-party operating and SG&A expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 were not material. During the
third quarter of 2014, Liberty Global and its subsidiaries began basing the fees charged and amounts allocated
among Liberty Global and its subsidiaries on actual costs incurred. As a result, during the third quarter of 2014,
UPC Holding recorded a €4.3 million increase to the net fees and allocations charged by UPC Holding to Liberty
Global and certain other Liberty Global subsidiaries to reflect the impact of this change in methodology as of
January 1, 2014. The impact of this change in methodology on UPC Holding’s related-party operating and
SG&A expenses was not material. Although UPC Holding believes that the related-party charges and allocations
described below are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the related-party costs and expenses reflected in
its consolidated statements of operations are reflective of the costs that it would incur on a standalone basis.
Except as noted below, UPC Holding’s related-party transactions are generally cash settled.

111


-----

**_Revenue_**

Related-party revenue consists primarily of (i) interconnect and other network access charges to Virgin

Media Inc. (“Virgin Media”), (ii) construction and programming services provided to certain non-consolidated
affiliates and (iii) programming services provided to Chellomedia B.V. (“Chellomedia”) until the sale of
substantially all of Chellomedia’s assets by Liberty Global on January 31, 2014. Virgin Media is a subsidiary of
Liberty Global that is outside of the UPC Holding borrowing group. Total related-party revenue was
€6.9 million, €12.1 million and €11.4 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Related-party operating expenses consist primarily of (i) programming and digital interactive services

provided by Chellomedia until the sale of substantially all of Chellomedia’s assets by Liberty Global on
January 31, 2014 and programming services provided by another subsidiary of Liberty Global that is outside of
the UPC Holding borrowing group in the aggregate amounts of €18.3 million, €51.9 million and €57.6 million
during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively and (ii) programming and interconnect
fees charged by certain of Liberty Global’s affiliates of €7.7 million, €6.3 million and €10.0 million during 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, amounts reflect (a) €12.7 million, €9.9 million and €7.4 million during
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of encryption and other operating expenses charged to Unitymedia KabelBW
GmbH (“Unitymedia KabelBW”), (b) €7.7 million, €0.2 million and nil during 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, of information technology-related expenses charged by Virgin Media and (c) aggregate recharges of
network-related and other items to (from) LG Europe and Liberty Global Europe Ltd. (“LGE Ltd.”), each a
subsidiary of Liberty Global that is outside of the UPC Holding borrowing group, of (€0.7 million), €2.1 million
and €1.4 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

**_SG&A Expenses_**

UPC Holding’s recorded aggregate net SG&A expenses, consist primarily of net cash settled administrative

and information technology-related expenses, primarily between UPC Holding, LG Europe, Virgin Media,
Unitymedia KabelBW, LGE Ltd. and other subsidiaries of Liberty Global that are outside of the UPC Holding
borrowing group that resulted in net charges (credits) of (€10.6 million), €6.8 million and €1.9 million during
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

**_Allocated Share-Based Compensation_**

Liberty Global allocates share-based compensation to UPC Holding associated with the Liberty Global

share-based incentive awards held by certain employees of UPC Holding’s subsidiaries. UPC Holding recorded
allocated share-based compensation of €28.0 million, €23.8 million and €16.5 million during 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively.

**_Fees and Allocations, Net_**

Fees and allocations, net, represent the aggregate net effect of charges between subsidiaries of UPC Holding

and various Liberty Global subsidiaries that are outside of the UPC Holding borrowing group, including
(i) charges to Unitymedia KabelBW of €106.1 million, €76.4 million and €53.7 million during 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively, which were partially loan settled, (ii) net charges to (from) Liberty Global and certain other
Liberty Global subsidiaries of (€41.6 million), (€11.0 million) and €10.3 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, which were partially loan settled, (iii) aggregate net charges from LG Europe and LGE Ltd. of
€40.0 million, €68.7 million and €61.6 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively and (iv) charges to VTR
Finance B.V. of €2.8 million, nil and nil during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These charges generally
relate to management, finance, legal, technology and other corporate and administrative services provided to or
by UPC Holding’s subsidiaries and, in the case of charges to Unitymedia KabelBW, also include charges related
to marketing and other services that support Unitymedia KabelBW’s broadband communications operations,
including the use of the UPC trademark.

During the first three quarters of 2014, UPC Holding allocated technology-based costs from UPC Holding

to other Liberty Global subsidiaries based on each subsidiary’s estimated proportionate share of these costs.
During the fourth quarter of 2014, UPC Holding changed the approach used to determine the amounts to be
charged by UPC Holding for technology services to other Liberty Global subsidiaries to a royalty-based method
that was made retroactively effective to January 1, 2014. During 2014, the €41.0 million proportional share of the
technology-based costs UPC Holding charged to other subsidiaries was €24.4 million more than the royaltybased technology fees UPC Holding charged under the new approach. Accordingly, the €24.4 million portion of

112


-----

UPC Holding’s related-party receivables that was attributable to this excess amount is reflected as a deemed
distribution of technology-related services. These technology-based charges are payable quarterly and are cash
settled unless otherwise determined by UPC Germany and Unitymedia KabelBW. Subsequent to the Corporate
Entities Transfer and the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology, UPC Holding will begin to receive
technology-based charges from other Liberty Global subsidiaries. The charges under the new royalty-based fees
are expected to escalate in future periods. Any excess of these charges over UPC Holding’s estimated
proportionate share of the underlying technology-based costs will be classified as management fees and added
back to arrive at the consolidated EBITDA figure used in its leverage covenant calculations.

**_Interest Expense_**

Related-party interest expense represents interest accrued on the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder

Loans, as discussed below. The interest expense is not paid in cash, but accrued and included in other long-term
liabilities during the year and then added to the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans balance at the end
of the year. UPC Holding recorded related-party interest expense of €884.3 million, €863.6 million and
€848.5 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

**_Interest Income_**

Related-party interest income relates to (i) a loan receivable (the UPC Broadband France Loan Receivable)

from VTR GlobalCom SpA (“VTR”), a subsidiary of Liberty Global that is outside of the UPC Holding
borrowing group, to a subsidiary of UPC Holding, UPC Broadband France SAS and (ii) during the 2013 and
2012 periods, a loan receivable from Unitymedia Hessen GmbH & Co. KG (“Unitymedia Hessen”), a subsidiary
of Liberty Global that is outside of the UPC Holding borrowing group, which was repaid during the second
quarter of 2013. The UPC Broadband France Loan Receivable was effectively repaid in January 2014. UPC
Holding recorded related-party interest income of €0.2 million, €8.9 million and €10.6 million during 2014, 2013
and 2012, respectively.

**_UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans_**

UPC Holding and LGE Financing are parties to a master (loan) agreement under which LGE Financing from

time to time provides unsecured shareholder loans. The UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans are
scheduled to be repaid in 2030 and are subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the UPCH
Notes in the event of (i) a total or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding up of UPC Holding, (ii) a
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to UPC Holding or its
property, (iii) an assignment for the benefit of creditors or (iv) any marshaling of UPC Holding’s assets or
liabilities. Accrued interest is included in other long-term liabilities until the end of each fiscal year and then it is
transferred to the loan balance. The interest rate on the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans is a fixed
rate of 9.79%. The net increase in the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans balance during 2014
includes (a) cash borrowings of €4,185.0 million, (b) cash payments of €3,522.4 million, (c) a €2,450.0 million
non-cash decrease related to the consideration received associated with the extraction of VTR, certain of its
parent entities and all of its subsidiary entities, (d) a €1,005.3 million non-cash increase related to the repayment
of outstanding indebtedness under UPC Holding’s Facilities R, S and AE, (e) additions of €878.2 million in noncash accrued interest and (f) a €38.8 million non-cash decrease related to the settlement of related-party charges
and allocations. The net increase in the Shareholder Loan balance during 2013 includes (1) cash borrowings of
€2,435.9 million, (2) cash payments of €2,309.3 million, (3) additions of €861.0 million in non-cash accrued
interest, (4) a €40.0 million non-cash decrease related to the settlement of related-party charges and allocations
and (5) an increase of €35.5 million in non-cash settlement of related-party capital additions. The net increase in
the Shareholder Loan balance during 2012 includes (I) cash payments of €2,272.6 million, (II) cash borrowings
of €1,265.0 million, (III) additions of €847.8 million in non-cash accrued interest, (IV) an increase of
€110.3 million in non-cash settlement of related-party capital additions and (V) a €68.0 million non-cash increase
related to the settlement of related-party charges and allocations. During the three-year period ended
December 31, 2014, none of the debt repayments were payments of interest.

**_UPC Equipment Related-Party Loan_**

At December 31, 2014, UPC Holding owed €78.4 million under a loan agreement (the “UPC Equipment

**Note”) between a subsidiary of Liberty Global and UPC Equipment B.V. (“UPC Equipment”), an unrestricted**
subsidiary of UPC Broadband Holding, as contemplated by the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. The
interest rate on this loan was 9.29% at December 31, 2014. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, certain leasing
transactions related to the UPC Equipment Note were unwound, which resulted in an early termination fee of
€87.0 million payable by UPC Equipment. This early termination fee was funded through the UPC Equipment

113


-----

Note and paid to Unitymedia International GmbH (“UMI”) and, in turn, UMI repaid in full the UMI Loan, as
discussed below, and loaned the remaining cash amount to Unitymedia Hessen.

**UMI Related-Party Loan**

At December 31, 2014, UPC Holding owed €27.5 million under a loan agreement (the “UMI Loan”)

between Unitymedia Hessen and UMI. The interest rate on this loan was 2.47% at December 31, 2014.
Subsequent to December 31, 2014, as discussed above, UMI used an €87.0 million early termination fee it
received from UPC Equipment to repay in full the UMI Loan, and loan the remaining cash amount to Unitymedia
Hessen. UMI was formed for the purpose of acquiring and legally owning certain customer premises equipment
assets to be leased to certain UPC Holding subsidiaries, including certain purchase and leaseback transactions
that were initiated in December 2011. Although UPC Holding has no equity or voting interest in UMI, the
transactions between UMI and certain of UPC Holding subsidiaries creates a variable interest in UMI for which
UPC Holding and certain of its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As
such, UPC Holding is required by the provisions of U.S. GAAP to consolidate UMI.

**Tax Losses of Dutch Entities**

UPC Holding and its Dutch subsidiaries are part of a Dutch tax fiscal unity with its ultimate Dutch parent

company Liberty Global Holding and certain other non-UPC Holding subsidiaries. The Dutch fiscal unity
combines individual tax-paying Dutch entities and their ultimate Dutch parent company as one taxpayer for
Dutch tax purposes. Intercompany tax allocations between members of the Dutch Fiscal Unity are not subject to
tax-sharing agreements and no cash payments are made between the companies related to the Dutch tax
attributes. Furthermore, UMI has entered into a tax integration agreement and a profit-sharing agreement with its
immediate parent, Unitymedia Hessen, who is primarily liable for the related tax obligations. As a result, UMI’s
income is fully attributed to Unitymedia Hessen and no provision for income taxes has been made in UPC
Holding’s consolidated financial statements for UMI on a separate return basis. The income taxes of subsidiaries
other than UMI that are not included within the Dutch fiscal unity are included in UPC Holding’s consolidated
financial statements on a separate return basis for each tax-paying entity or group based on the local tax law.

For tax purposes, UPC Holding’s net operating losses for the year can be offset with taxable income of non
UPC Holding subsidiaries within the Dutch Fiscal unity. UPC Holding and Liberty Global Holding do not
operate under a tax sharing agreement and no cash payments are made between the companies related to Dutch
tax liabilities.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE UPC BROADBAND HOLDING BANK FACILITY**

The following contains a summary of the material provisions of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

It does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying
documents. Some of the terms used herein are defined in these agreements, and the Issuer has not included all of
such definitions herein. In the following text, the terms, “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the
context requires, to UPC Holding or collectively to UPC Holding and its subsidiaries.

**Introduction**

The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is a senior secured credit facility agreement entered into on

January 16, 2004, as amended and restated from time to time, including pursuant to a deed of amendment and
restatement dated May 10, 2006 and further amended pursuant to amendment letters dated December 11, 2006,
April 16, 2007, April 30, 2009, June 9, 2009, and October 15, 2013, between, among others, UPC Broadband
Holding, as borrower, The Bank of Nova Scotia as facility agent and security agent, and certain banks and
financial institutions as lenders, also referred to in this Offering Memorandum as the “UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility”. A copy of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is set forth as Annex A to this Offering
Memorandum.

Pursuant to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, The Bank of Nova Scotia as facility agent, and a

number of banks and financial institutions, agreed to make available to the Borrowers (as defined below) certain
term loans and additional facilities, from time to time, by procuring additional lenders to accede to the UPC

certain of its subsidiaries, is a guarantor under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

Each of the Finco Accession Agreements contains the advance consent of the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, to

certain amendments to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility that UPC Broadband Holding may request in

(c) The carrying value of Facilities AG and AH include the impact of discounts.

(d) The UPCB Notes were issued by certain special purpose entities (the UPCB SPEs) that were created for the
primary purpose of facilitating the offering of UPCB Notes. The proceeds from the UPCB Notes were used
to fund additional Facilities V, Y, Z, AC and AD (each a UPCB SPE Funded Facility), with UPC Financing,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC Holding, as the borrower. Each UPCB SPE is dependent on payments
from UPC Financing under the applicable UPCB SPE Funded Facility in order to service its payment
obligations under each respective UPCB SPE Note. Although UPC Financing has no equity or voting
interest in any of the UPCB SPEs, each of the UPCB SPE Funded Facility loans creates a variable interest in
the respective UPCB SPE for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S.
GAAP. As such, UPC Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding and Liberty Global, are
required by the provisions of U.S. GAAP to consolidate the UPCB SPEs. As a result, the amounts
outstanding under Facilities V, Y, Z, AC and AD are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.

(e) Facility AH has a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.

For a description of recent changes to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility since December 31, 2014,

see “General Description of UPC Holding’s Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Recent Developments of
_UPC Holding”._

**_Interest Rates_**

Under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the rate of interest for each interest period in respect of

each facility under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is the percentage rate per annum equal to the
aggregate of an applicable margin, EURIBOR (in relation to any loan drawn under any facility in euros) or
LIBOR (in relation to any loan drawn under any facility in U.S. dollars or any currency of a country in which a
member of the Borrower Group is incorporated and/or carries out its business and whose functional currency is
other than euros) and any mandatory cost (calculated in accordance with the historic standard LMA calculations
and formulae). Interest accrues daily from and including the first day of an interest period and is payable on the
last day of each interest period (unless the interest period is longer than six months) and is calculated on the basis
of a 360-day year.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

UPC Holding and certain of its subsidiaries act as guarantors in guaranteeing the obligations of the

borrowers under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility to the extent permitted by law. In addition, the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility requires, under certain circumstances, that additional members of the Borrower
Group, as defined therein, become guarantors under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in order to
ensure that the guarantors and their subsidiaries account for 95% of the Borrower Group’s, as defined therein,
consolidated EBITDA.

The indebtedness under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is primarily secured by way of a pledge

over the shares in the holding company in each of the main jurisdictions in which the Borrower Group, as defined
therein, operates. In addition pledges over certain intercompany receivables and Subordinated Shareholder Loans
have also been granted.

**_Prepayment_**

In addition to scheduled repayments of principal, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility must be

prepaid (each facility to the extent and in such proportion as described therein) on the occurrence of any of the
following events: (i) change of control; (ii) issuance of Relevant Convertible Preference Shares; (iii) receipt of
Excess Cash Flow; or (iv) receipt of net proceeds of asset sales, each as defined therein.

Further, the indebtedness under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in

whole or in part, on giving at least five business days’ prior written notice and in a minimum amount of
€10,000,000 (or its equivalent in U.S. dollars or other currency), without premium or penalty and subject to break
funding costs if any such prepayment is not made on an interest payment date. Any such voluntary prepayment is
to be applied against the facilities in such proportions as stipulated by UPC Broadband Holding in the notice of
prepayment.

The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility contains detailed provisions in relation to voluntary and

mandatory prepayment. Such prepayments are described as being subject to certain conditions and exceptions
such as the application of prepayment proceeds and the order of such application.

116


-----

**_Undertakings_**

The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility contains certain negative undertakings that, subject to certain

customary and other agreed exceptions, limit the ability of the Borrower Group, as defined therein, and, in
certain cases, UPC Holding to, amongst other things:

    - incur, create or otherwise permit to be outstanding, any financial indebtedness;

    - reduce its capital or purchase or redeem any class of its shares or any other ownership interest in it;

    - create or permit to subsist any security interest on or over the whole or any part of its assets, rights or
remedies or prefer any future indebtedness of any member of the Borrower Group;

    - sell, transfer, lease out, lend, cease to exercise direct control over or otherwise dispose of any part of its
assets, rights, revenue or shareholdings;

    - grant or permit to subsist any guarantees, indemnities or any loan or grant any credit;

    - amend its constitutional documents;

    - declare, make or pay any dividend on or make any distribution or pay any other amounts in respect of,
or redeem its share capital, capital stock or other securities;

    - make any payment of principal of, or interest on, any loans, transfer assets or other payments to LGE
Financing, UPC Holding, LG Europe and certain associated companies of LG Europe;

    - enter into any interest rate or currency swaps or other hedging arrangements other than as permitted
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility; and

    - issue any shares of any class to any person other than to a member of the Borrower Group, provided
that the shares are charged.

In addition, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility also requires UPC Broadband Holding and each

obligor to observe certain affirmative undertakings subject to materiality and other customary and agreed
exceptions.

A summary of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is set forth below. This summary is qualified in

its entirety by reference to the text of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A to this Offering Memorandum and incorporated herein by reference.

**Borrowers:** UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing together with any member of the
Borrower Group (as defined below) which becomes an “Additional Borrower”.

**Guarantors:** UPC Financing, UPC Broadband Holding, UPC Holding II B.V., UPC Holding, UPC
France Holding B.V., UPC Luxembourg Holding B.V., UPC Western Europe

such other company which is the immediate holding company of UPC
Broadband Holding from time to time) and UPC Holding II B.V.) and their
respective subsidiaries; and

2.2 such additional subsidiaries of UPC Broadband Holding which have become

Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries,

is equal to or greater than 95% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower Group
(as defined below). If necessary UPC Broadband Holding shall ensure additional of
its subsidiaries become guarantors to comply with this guarantor coverage test.

The Borrowers and Guarantors are together referred to as the “Obligors”.

117


-----

**Borrower Group:** Borrower Group means:

(a) UPC Broadband Holding and its subsidiaries from time to time excluding
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries”; and

(b) UPC Financing.

An “Unrestricted Subsidiary” means each subsidiary of UPC Broadband Holding, the
acquisition cost of which and whose on-going funding requirements are not funded
directly or indirectly by any member of the Borrower Group by way of drawings
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

**Facility Agent and**

**Security Agent:** The Bank of Nova Scotia.

**Majority Lenders:** Lenders whose undrawn commitments and participations in outstanding advances
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility exceed 66[2]/3% of the aggregate
undrawn commitments and outstanding advances.

If such commitments or participations in advances are denominated in a currency
other than euro they are translated into euros.


**Material Adverse**

**Effect:**


Any event or circumstance which has a material adverse effect on the ability of the
Obligors (as a whole) to perform their payment or other material obligations under
any of the finance documents (a “MAE”).


**Additional Facilities:** There have been numerous accessions of “Additional Facilities” under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility previously and there are currently 6 Additional
Facilities outstanding. Such Additional Facilities are the only facilities outstanding
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. For further details, please refer to
“—Structure”.

Any person may become a Lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
by delivering to the Facility Agent an accession agreement (an “Additional Facility
Accession Agreement”) which must be duly executed by that person, the Facility
Agent and UPC Broadband Holding. That person shall become a Lender on the date
specified in the Additional Facility Accession Agreement.

Each Lender will grant to the relevant Borrower a term loan facility (the “Additional
Facility”) in the amount specified in the Additional Facility Accession Agreement in
euros, U.S. dollars or any of the lawful currencies in countries in which a member of
the Borrower Group is incorporated or does business.

Upon the relevant person becoming a Lender, the total commitments under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility shall be increased by the amount in the Additional
Facility Accession Agreement.

Execution of the Additional Facility Accession Agreement by UPC Broadband
Holding and the relevant Borrower constitutes confirmation by each Guarantor that its
guarantee obligations shall extend to the increased total commitments but otherwise
continue unaffected.

**Purpose:** Each advance will be applied to finance the general corporate and working capital
purposes of the Borrower Group, including, to finance capital expenditure and the
making of acquisitions by the Borrower Group and the repayment or prepayment of
any additional facilities.

**Final Maturity Date:** Maturity dates are set out in each relevant Additional Facility Accession Agreement.
There are currently Additional Facilities with maturities extending until January 15,
2022.

118


-----

**Interest:** Under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility the rate of interest for each advance
(for an interest period of one, two or three months at the relevant Borrower’s option,
or such other period not exceeding six months as agreed with all the Lenders) is
expressed to be the rate per annum determined by the Facility Agent to be the
aggregate of:

(a) the applicable margin;

(b) LIBOR (in the case of an advance denominated in U.S. dollars or other currency)
or EURIBOR (in the case of an advance denominated in euros); and

(c) mandatory costs (calculated in accordance with the historic standard LMA
calculations and formulae).

The margin for each Additional Facility is set out in the relevant Additional Facility
Accession Agreement.

There is nothing in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility which restricts an
Additional Facility from having a fixed interest rate. Additional Facility AK and
Additional Faclity AL which are the Additional Facilities to be lent by the Issuer, will
have a fixed interest rate.

Interest is payable on the last day of each interest period but not less than semiannually.

Default margin for unpaid amounts shall be 2% above the standard margin level.

**Repayment:** The repayment profile of each Additional Facility is set out in the relevant Additional
Facility Accession Agreement.


**Mandatory**

**Prepayment:**


Mandatory prepayment and cancellation of all Additional Facilities is required in the
circumstances set out in greater detail in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility,
including in the circumstances and in the amounts described below:

(a) at the option of the Majority Lenders, all Additional Facilities will be cancelled
and all amounts outstanding will be prepaid, on the occurrence of:

(i) UGC ceasing to directly or indirectly own more than 50% of the issued
share capital of UGC Europe Inc. (currently known as Liberty Global
Europe, LLC) (“UGCE Inc.”) and ceasing to exercise management control
over UGCE Inc.; or

(ii) UGCE Inc. ceasing to be the direct or indirect legal and beneficial owner of

more than 50% of the voting and economic rights attaching to the issued

immediate holding company of UPC Broadband Holding from time to time)
(“UPC Broadband Holdco”); or

(iii) UPC Broadband Holdco ceasing, either directly or indirectly through one or

more of its subsidiaries or other persons it controls, to be the legal and

Holding and UPC Holding II B.V., or otherwise ceasing to have the power
to exercise management control over each of UPC Broadband Holding and
UPC Holding II B.V.; or

(iv) UPC Broadband Holding ceasing, either directly or indirectly through one

or more of its subsidiaries or other persons it controls, to be the legal and
beneficial owner of at least 75% of the issued share capital of any Obligor
or otherwise ceasing to have the power to exercise management control
over such Obligor (other than UPC Broadband Holdco, UPC Holding
II B.V., UPC Financing and UPC Broadband Holding); or

(v) UPC Broadband Holdco and UPC Holding II B.V. ceasing to be the legal
and beneficial owners of 100% of the partnership interests in and economic
rights attaching to the partnership interests of, or otherwise ceasing to have

119


-----

(b) an amount of all Additional Facilities equal to 50% of excess cashflow for any
financial year is required to be prepaid, provided that such a prepayments of
excess cashflow will not be required:

(i) after the date that the Facility Agent receives accounts which show that, for
the two most recent six month test periods (each covering two consecutive
quarter end dates) the ratio of senior debt (which shall be reduced by the
aggregate amount of all cash and cash equivalent investments held by any
member of the Borrower Group as stated in the relevant accounts) to
annualized EBITDA is less than or equal to 4:1;

(ii) if the excess cash flow in respect of the relevant financial year is less than

€5,000,000; or

(iii) if the Facility Agent acting on behalf of the Majority Lenders agrees

otherwise; and

(c) an amount of all the Additional Facilities equal to 40% of the proceeds of an
issue of convertible preference shares by a member of the UGCE Borrower
Group (defined as UGCE Inc.; any other company of which UPC Broadband
Holding is a subsidiary and which is a subsidiary of UGCE Inc.; and UPC
Holding II B.V.) is required to be prepaid (and such prepayment shall be applied
pro rata against all outstanding advances), provided that such prepayment will
not be required after the date the Facility Agent receives accounts which show
that for the two most recent six month test periods (each covering two
consecutive quarter end dates) the ratio of senior debt to annualized EBITDA is
less than or equal to 3.5:1; and

(d) an amount of all the Additional Facilities equal to four times annualized
EBITDA of any person or asset that is disposed of in accordance with the
disposals clause (other than certain permitted disposals) is required to be
prepaid, provided that such prepayment will not be required:

(i) where the amount required to be prepaid would be less than €100,000,000;

(ii) where the amount required to be prepaid is instead deposited into a blocked

account on terms that such amount may only be released to make a
prepayment in relation to a disposal or to reinvest in assets (including
permitted acquisitions and capital expenditure). Any amount not reinvested
within 12 months will be applied in prepayment of the Additional Facilities;
or

(iii) where the Majority Lenders waive the requirement to prepay, provided that

prepayment will still be required to ensure that the financial ratios for the
most recent six month test period (covering two consecutive quarter end
dates) in respect of the disposal would not be breached if such ratios were
tested for that test period taking into account the disposals made since the
last day of that test period and any prepayment.

Any prepayment of the Additional Facilities from excess cash flow or an issue of
convertible preference shares will be applied pro rata against outstanding advances,
first against advances other than advances that can be prepaid and re-borrowed (and,
if applicable, against the repayment installments for the relevant Additional Facility
or Additional Facilities in such order as may be specified by UPC Broadband
Holding) and second against advances that can be repaid or voluntarily prepaid and
reborrowed.

Any prepayment of the Additional Facilities from disposal proceeds will be applied
against the Additional Facilities at UPC Broadband Holding’s election and against
outstanding advances under the relevant Additional Facility, pro rata (and, if
applicable, against the repayment installments for the relevant Additional Facility or
Additional Facilities in such order as may be specified by UPC Broadband Holding).

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF UPC HOLDING**

The following contains a summary of the material provisions of the intercreditor deed with respect to the

UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the UPCH Notes, the UPC Holding Facility and certain intercompany
loans. It does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the
underlying documents. Some of the terms used herein are defined in these agreements, and the Issuer has not
included all of such definitions herein. In the following text, the terms, “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us”
may refer, as the context requires, to UPC Holding or collectively to UPC Holding and its subsidiaries.

**Security Deeds**

A security deed executed in October 2000 (the “October Security Deed”), and a security deed executed in

January 2004, (the “January Security Deed”), which together with the October Security Deed, are referred to as
(the “Security Deeds”), were entered into in connection with a senior credit agreement between UPC Broadband
Holding B.V. as borrower, TD Bank Europe Limited (subsequently replaced by The Bank of Nova Scotia), as
facility agent and certain other banks and financial institutions and was executed on October 26, 2000 (the
“October Facility”) and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, respectively. The October Security Deed
regulates the sharing and enforcement of the security as between the lenders, their agent, and the relevant hedge
providers and is still in force notwithstanding the fact that the October Facility has now been repaid in full. The
January Security Deed, which is substantially in the same form as the October Security Deed, regulates the
sharing and enforcement of the security as between the lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility,
their agent and the relevant hedge providers. The main difference between the two Security Deeds is that the
senior hedging banks and senior hedging counterparties are not party to the January Security Deed since their
interests are already secured and are covered in the October Security Deed. However, the high yield hedging
counterparties and high yield hedging banks under the October Security Deed are party to the January Security
Deed, which provides that the high yield hedging banks shall share, pro rata with the lenders and the senior
hedging banks, up to €200,000,000 on any enforcement (as opposed to €100,000,000 under the October Security
Deed). High yield hedging covers any agreement that hedges interest rate or currency exposure in relation to high
yield notes or any other form of subordinated debt raised outside of the Borrower Group and on-lent to the
Borrower Group for application (in whole or in part) in prepayment of the facilities.

Any sums advanced as an additional facility (under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility) will benefit

from the security granted in connection with the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the lenders of any
such additional facility will accede to the January Security Deed.

**€600 million 6[3]/8% Senior Notes**

On September 21, 2012, we issued the 6[3]/8% Notes. The 6[3]/8% Notes mature on September 15, 2022. The

6[3]/8% Notes benefit from the intercreditor arrangements described below. The 6[3]/8% Notes are senior obligations
that rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our existing and future
subordinated debt. The 6[3]/8% Notes are secured by a fourth ranking pledge over the shares of UPC Holding. In
addition, the 6[3]/8% Notes provide that any failure to pay principal prior to expiration of any applicable grace
period, or any acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of €50.0 million or more in the aggregate of UPC
Holding or its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture), including UPC Broadband Holding and UPC
Financing, is an event of default under the 6[3]/8% Notes.

At any time prior to September 17, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the 6[3]/8% Notes by paying a

specified “make-whole” premium.

On or after September 15, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the 6[3]/8% Notes at certain redemption prices

(expressed as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued interest and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during a specified 12 month period. In addition,
at any time prior to September 15, 2015, we may redeem up to 40% of the 6[3]/8% Notes (at a redemption price of
106.375% of the principal amount) with the net proceeds from one or more specified equity offerings.

We may redeem all of the 6[3]/8% Notes at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid

interest upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law. If we or certain of our subsidiaries sell certain assets
or experience specific changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the 6[3]/8% Notes at a redemption price of
101%.

127


-----

**€450 million 6[3]/4% Senior Notes and CHF 350 million 6[3]/4% Senior Notes**

On March 26, 2013, we issued the 6[3]/4% Notes. The 6[3]/4% Notes mature on March 15, 2023. The 6[3]/4%

Notes benefit from the intercreditor arrangements described below. The 6[3]/4% Notes are senior obligations that
rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of our existing and future
subordinated debt. The 6[3]/4% Notes are secured by a fifth ranking pledge over the shares of UPC Holding. In
addition, the 6[3]/4% Notes provide that any failure to pay principal prior to expiration of any applicable grace
period, or any acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of €50.0 million or more in the aggregate of UPC
Holding or its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture), including UPC Broadband Holding and UPC
Financing, is an event of default under the 6[3]/4% Notes.

At any time prior to March 15, 2018, we may redeem some or all of the 6[3]/4% Notes by paying a specified

“make-whole” premium.

On or after March 15, 2018, we may redeem some or all of the 6[3]/4% Notes at certain redemption prices

(expressed as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued interest and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during a specified 12 month period. In addition,
at any time prior to March 15, 2016, we may redeem up to 40% of the 6[3]/4% Notes (at a redemption price of
106.750% of the principal amount) with the net proceeds from one or more specified equity offerings.

We may redeem all of the 6[3]/4% Notes at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid

interest upon the occurrence of certain changes in tax law. If we or certain of our subsidiaries sell certain assets
or experience specific changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the 6[3]/4% Notes at a redemption price of
101%.

**UPCB II Senior Secured Notes and Facility Y under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility**

On January 31, 2011, UPCB Finance II Limited, a special purpose financing company created for the

primary purpose of issuing senior notes and owned 100% by a charitable trust, issued €750.0 million principal
amount of 6[3]/8% senior secured notes (the “UPCB II Senior Secured Notes”) resulting in gross proceeds of
€750.0 million. UPCB Finance II Limited used the proceeds from the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes to fund a
new Facility Y under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, with UPC Financing, an indirectly
wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC Holding, as the borrower. UPC Financing used the proceeds from Facility Y to
reduce outstanding amounts under Facilities M and U under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

UPCB Finance II Limited is dependent on payments from UPC Financing under Facility Y in order to

service its payment obligations under the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes. Although UPC Financing has no equity
or voting interest in UPCB Finance II Limited, the Facility Y loan creates a variable interest in UPCB Finance II
Limited for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As such, UPC
Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding, are required by the provisions of U.S. GAAP to
consolidate UPCB Finance II Limited following the issuance of the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes. Accordingly,
the amounts outstanding under Facility Y are eliminated within UPC Holding’s consolidated financial
statements.

The UPCB II Senior Secured Notes have been issued pursuant to an indenture, dated January 31, 2011.

Facility Y is made pursuant to an Additional Facility Y Accession Agreement (the “Facility Y Accession
Agreement”). Pursuant to the Facility Y Accession Agreement, the call provisions, maturity and applicable
interest rate for Facility Y are the same as those of the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes. UPCB Finance II Limited,
as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, will be treated the same as the other lenders under
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to those
benefits, rights and protections afforded to the other lenders. Through the covenants in the indenture governing
the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes and the security interests over (i) all of the issued shares of UPCB Finance II
Limited and (ii) Facility Y, granted to secure UPCB Finance II Limited’s obligations under the UPCB II Senior
Secured Notes, the holders of the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes are provided indirectly with the benefits, rights,
protections and covenants, granted to UPCB Finance II Limited as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding
Bank Facility.

UPCB Finance II Limited is prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, subject to certain

exceptions under the indenture governing the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes.

The UPCB II Senior Secured Notes will be redeemed as part of the Refinancing. See “General Description

_of UPC Holdings Business, the Issuer and the Offering—Recent Developments of UPC Holding”._

128


-----

The UPCB II Senior Secured Notes are non-callable until July 1, 2015. At any time prior to July 1, 2015,

upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event (being a voluntary prepayment of all or a portion of Facility
Y), UPCB Finance II Limited will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes
equal to the amount of Facility Y prepaid, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal
amount thereof, (ii) the excess of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price on
July 1, 2015, plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due through July 1, 2015, computed
using the discount rate specified in the indenture, over (b) the principal amount of the UPCB II Senior Secured
Notes on the redemption date and (iii) accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
applicable redemption date. On or after July 1, 2015, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event (as
defined in the indenture), UPCB Finance II Limited will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the UPCB II
Senior Secured Notes equal to the principal amount of Facility Y prepaid at the redemption prices set forth in the
indenture governing the UPCB II Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to the applicable redemption date.

**UPCB III Senior Secured Notes and Facility Z under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility**

On February 16, 2011, UPCB Finance III Limited, a special purpose financing company created for the

primary purpose of issuing senior notes and owned 100% by a charitable trust, issued $1.0 billion (€826.5 million
equivalent) principal amount of 6[5]/8% senior secured notes (the “UPCB III Senior Secured Notes”) resulting in
gross proceeds of $1.0 billion. UPCB Finance III Limited used the proceeds from the UPCB III Senior Secured
Notes to fund a new Facility Z under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, with UPC Financing, an
indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC Holding, as the borrower. UPC Financing used the proceeds from
Facility Z to reduce outstanding amounts under Facilities P and T under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility.

UPCB Finance III Limited is dependent on payments from UPC Financing under Facility Z in order to

service its payment obligations under the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes. Although UPC Financing has no
equity or voting interest in UPCB Finance III Limited, the Facility Z loan creates a variable interest in UPCB
Finance III Limited for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As
such, UPC Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding, are required by the provisions of
U.S. GAAP to consolidate UPCB Finance III Limited following the issuance of the UPCB III Senior Secured
Notes. Accordingly, the amounts outstanding under Facility Z are eliminated within UPC Holding’s consolidated
financial statements.

The UPCB III Senior Secured Notes have been issued pursuant to an indenture, dated February 16, 2011.

Facility Z is made pursuant to an Additional Facility Z Accession Agreement (the “Facility Z Accession
Agreement”). Pursuant to the Facility Z Accession Agreement, the call provisions, maturity and applicable
interest rate for Facility Z are the same as those of the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes. UPCB Finance III
Limited, as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, will be treated the same as the other
lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are
similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to the other lenders. Through the covenants in the
indenture governing the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes and the security interests over (i) all of the issued shares
of UPCB Finance III Limited and (ii) Facility Z, granted to secure UPCB Finance III’s obligations under the
UPCB III Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes are provided indirectly with
the benefits, rights, protections and covenants, granted to UPCB Finance III Limited as a lender under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

UPCB Finance III Limited is prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, subject to certain

exceptions under the indenture governing the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes.

The UPCB III Senior Secured Notes are non-callable until July 1, 2015. At any time prior to July 1, 2015,

upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event (being a voluntary prepayment of all or a portion of Facility
Z), UPCB Finance III Limited will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes
equal to the amount of Facility Z prepaid, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) 100% of the principal
amount thereof, (ii) the excess of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price on
July 1, 2015, plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due through July 1, 2015, computed
using the discount rate specified in the indenture, over (b) the principal amount of the UPCB III Senior Secured
Notes on the redemption date and (iii) accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the
applicable redemption date. On or after July 1, 2015, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event (as
defined in the indenture), UPCB Finance III Limited will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the UPCB III

129


-----

Senior Secured Notes equal to the principal amount of Facility Z prepaid at the redemption prices set forth in the
indenture governing the UPCB III Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date.

The UPCB III Senior Secured Notes will be redeemed as part of the Refinancing. See “General Description

**UPCB V Senior Secured Notes and Facility AC under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility**

On November 16, 2011, UPCB Finance V Limited, a special purpose financing company created for the

primary purpose of issuing senior notes and owned 100% by a charitable trust, issued $750.0 million
(€619.8 million equivalent) principal amount of 7[1]/4% senior secured notes (the “UPCB V Senior Secured
Notes”) resulting in gross proceeds of $750.0 million. UPCB Finance V Limited used the proceeds from the
UPCB V Senior Secured Notes to fund a new Facility AC under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, with
UPC Financing, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC Holding, as the borrower. UPC Financing used
part of the proceeds from Facility AC to reduce outstanding amounts under Facility AA under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility with the remainder being used for general corporate purposes.

UPCB Finance V Limited is dependent on payments from UPC Financing under Facility AC in order to

service its payment obligations under the UPCB V Senior Secured Notes. Although UPC Financing has no equity
or voting interest in UPCB Finance V Limited, the Facility AC loan creates a variable interest in UPCB Finance
V Limited for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As such, UPC
Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding, are required by the provisions of U.S. GAAP to

statements.

The UPCB V Senior Secured Notes have been issued pursuant to an indenture, dated November 16, 2011.

Facility AC is made pursuant to an Additional Facility AC Accession Agreement (the “Facility AC Accession
Agreement”). Pursuant to the Facility AC Accession Agreement, the call provisions, maturity and applicable

Limited, as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, will be treated the same as the other
lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are
similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to the other lenders. Through the covenants in the
indenture governing the UPCB V Senior Secured Notes and the security interests over (i) all of the issued shares
of UPCB Finance V Limited and (ii) Facility AC, granted to secure UPCB Finance V’s obligations under the
UPCB V Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the UPCB V Senior Secured Notes are provided indirectly with
the benefits, rights, protections and covenants, granted to UPCB Finance V Limited as a lender under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

UPCB Finance V Limited is prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, subject to certain

exceptions under the indenture governing the UPCB V Senior Secured Notes.

The UPCB V Senior Secured Notes are non-callable until November 15, 2016. At any time prior to

November 15, 2016, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event (being a voluntary prepayment of all or
a portion of Facility AC), UPCB Finance V Limited will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the UPCB V
Senior Secured Notes equal to the amount of Facility AC prepaid, at a redemption price equal to the sum of
(i) 100% of the principal amount thereof, (ii) the excess of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the
redemption price on November 15, 2016, plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due
through November 15, 2016, computed using the discount rate specified in the indenture, over (b) the principal
amount of the UPCB V Senior Secured Notes on the redemption date and (iii) accrued but unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date. On or after November 15, 2016, upon the
occurrence of an Early Redemption Event (as defined in the indenture), UPCB Finance V Limited will redeem an
aggregate principal amount of the UPCB V Senior Secured Notes equal to the principal amount of Facility AC
prepaid at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the UPCB V Senior Secured Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date.

**UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes and Facility AD under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility**

On February 7, 2012, UPCB Finance VI Limited, a special purpose financing company created for the

primary purpose of issuing senior notes and owned 100% by a charitable trust, issued $750.0 million (€619.8
million equivalent) principal amount of 6[7]/8% senior secured notes (the “UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes”)
resulting in gross proceeds of $750.0 million. UPCB Finance VI Limited used the proceeds from the UPCB VI
Senior Secured Notes to fund a new Facility AD under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, with UPC
Financing, an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of UPC Holding, as the borrower. UPC Financing used the
proceeds from Facility AD to reduce outstanding amounts under Facilities M, N and O under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

UPCB Finance VI Limited is dependent on payments from UPC Financing under Facility AD in order to

service its payment obligations under the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes. Although UPC Financing has no
equity or voting interest in UPCB Finance VI Limited, the Facility AD loan creates a variable interest in UPCB
Finance VI Limited for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As
such, UPC Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding, are required by the provisions of
U.S. GAAP to consolidate UPCB Finance VI Limited following the issuance of the UPCB VI Senior Secured
Notes. Accordingly, the amounts outstanding under Facility AD are eliminated within UPC Holding’s
consolidated financial statements.

The UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes have been issued pursuant to an indenture, dated February 7, 2012.

Facility AD is made pursuant to an Additional Facility AD Accession Agreement (the “Facility AD Accession
Agreement”). Pursuant to the Facility AD Accession Agreement, the call provisions, maturity and applicable
interest rate for Facility AD are the same as those of the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes. UPCB Finance VI
Limited, as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, will be treated the same as the other
lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are
similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to the other lenders. Through the covenants in the
indenture governing the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes and the security interests over (i) all of the issued shares
of UPCB Finance VI Limited and (ii) Facility AD, granted to secure UPCB Finance VI’s obligations under the
UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes are provided indirectly with
the benefits, rights, protections and covenants, granted to UPCB Finance VI Limited as a lender under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

UPCB Finance VI Limited is prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, subject to certain

exceptions under the indenture governing the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes.

The UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes are non-callable until January 15, 2017. At any time prior to

January 15, 2017, upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event (being a voluntary prepayment of all or a
portion of Facility AD), UPCB Finance VI Limited will redeem an aggregate principal amount of the UPCB VI
Senior Secured Notes equal to the amount of Facility AD prepaid, at a redemption price equal to the sum of
(i) 100% of the principal amount thereof, (ii) the excess of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the
redemption price on January 15, 2017, plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due through
January 15, 2017, computed using the discount rate specified in the indenture, over (b) the principal amount of
the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes on the redemption date and (iii) accrued but unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date. On or after January 15, 2017, upon the occurrence of an Early
Redemption Event (as defined in the indenture), UPCB Finance VI Limited will redeem an aggregate principal
amount of the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes equal to the principal amount of Facility AD prepaid at the
redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the UPCB VI Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date.

**Euro Notes offered in the Concurrent Euro Notes Offering and Facility AK under the UPC Broadband**
**Holding Bank Facility**

For a description of the Euro Notes (which will be governed by the same Indenture governing the Dollar

Notes) and Facility AK under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see “Description of the Notes”.

**UPC Holding Facility**

The UPC Holding Facility is a loan facility agreement entered into between us as borrower, Toronto

Dominion (Texas) LLC as facility agent, certain banks and other financial institutions, that was executed in June
2007 and first amended on July 9, 2007. Currently, no amounts are outstanding under the UPC Holding Facility.

131


-----

Pursuant to the UPC Holding Facility, the facility agent and other banks and financial institutions, from time

to time, have agreed to make available to us a term loan and additional facilities, from time to time, by procuring
additional lenders to accede to the UPC Holding Facility.

Prior to May 16, 2008, the UPC Holding Facility consisted of a € 250 million term loan facility (the “UPCH

Loan”). Effective May 16, 2008, the fully drawn commitments of the lenders under the €250.0 million UPC
Holding Facility were rolled into Facility M under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (the
“Conversion”).

The applicable margin for the UPCH Loan prior to the Conversion was 2.75% per annum and 2.00%

thereafter. The applicable margin for any additional facility provided under the UPC Holding Facility will be
prescribed in the relevant accession agreement.

**Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the UPCH Notes and the UPC Holding Facility**

The UPC Holding Facility (if applicable), the 9[7]/8% Notes, the 6[3]/8% Notes, and the 6[3]/4% Notes currently

benefit from a first, second, third, and fourth ranking pledges respectively over all the shares of UPC Holding.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the following order of priority shall apply to the satisfaction of

our obligations with respect to the security:

   - first, the UPC Holding Facility (if applicable), the 9[7]/8% Notes, the 6[3]/8% Notes, the 6 [3]⁄4% Notes, and
certain other future indebtedness of ours that ranks pari passu on a secured basis; and

   - second, certain other future indebtedness that ranks junior to the the UPC Holding Facility, the 9[7]/8%
Notes, the 6[3]/8% Notes, and the 6 [3]⁄4% Notes on a junior secured basis.

Please note that this contractual arrangement is subject to certain limitations under Dutch law.

We are also a guarantor of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility on a senior basis. We do not

anticipate that the lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility will become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**Intercreditor Deed with Respect to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility**

The obligors and finance parties under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility entered into an

intercreditor deed on January 16, 2004 with, among others, TD Bank Europe Limited and Toronto Dominion
(Texas) LLC as facility agents under the October Facility, TD Bank Europe Limited as facility agent under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and certain subsidiaries of UPC Broadband Holding, to regulate the
arrangements in respect of security created under the October Facility, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility and the relationships between the parties holding the benefit of such security.

The intercreditor deed stipulates that the security created under the January Security Documents will rank

_pari passu with the security created under the October Security Documents (regardless of, for example, the order_
in which any document is registered or executed, or the point at which any debt is incurred, or any fluctuations in
the outstanding amount of any debt incurred pursuant to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility). Please note
that this contractual arrangement is subject to certain limitations under Dutch law.

**UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans**

LGE Financing and UPC Holding are parties to a master (loan) agreement dated February 28, 2001 under

which LGE Financing from time to time provides loans to us. The interest rate was 9.79% for the year ended
December 31, 2014 and is reviewed on an annual basis.

As of December 31, 2014, €9.8 billion of UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans were outstanding.

The UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans, as amended on August 3, 2010, mature on March 1, 2030
and, subject to the terms of the indentures for the UPCH Notes, may be repaid by us at any time prior to maturity.
In addition, subject to the terms of the indentures of the UPCH Notes, interest on the UPC Holding Subordinated
Shareholder Loans, which may be set by the lender from time to time, is payable in cash or, at the option of UPC
Holding, in kind.

Subordination of the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans

Until the UPCH Notes are discharged, we will not be permitted to make any payment on the UPC Holding

Subordinated Shareholder Loans other than as provided under the indentures for the UPCH Notes. In addition,

132


-----

we will not be permitted to take any prohibited action that would cause the UPC Holding Subordinated
Shareholder Loans to not constitute Subordinated Shareholder Loans under the indenture for the UPCH Notes.
The UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans:

(1) are without prejudice to the ability of UPC Holding to make voluntary prepayments not prohibited by
the indentures for the UPCH Notes, do not mature or require any amortization, redemption or other
repayment of principal or any sinking fund payment prior to the first anniversary of the stated maturity
of the UPCH Notes;

(2) are without prejudice to the ability of UPC Holding to make payments of interest not prohibited by the
indentures for the UPCH Notes, do not require, prior to the first anniversary of the stated maturity of
the UPCH Notes, any mandatory payment of cash interest, cash withholding amounts or other grossups, or any similar mandatory cash payments;

(3) contain no change of control or similar provisions that are effective, and do not accelerate and have no
right to declare a default or event of default or take any enforcement action or otherwise require any
mandatory payment prior to the first anniversary of the stated maturity of the UPCH Notes; and

(4) do not provide for or require any security interest or encumbrance over any asset of UPC Holding or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined under “Description of the Notes”).

In addition, we may not make any payment or distribution of any kind of character with respect to any

obligations on, or relating to, any of the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans if (i) a payment default
on the UPCH Notes occurs and is continuing or (ii) any other default under the indentures for the UPCH Notes
occurs and is continuing on the UPCH Notes that permits the holders of the UPCH Notes to accelerate their
maturity and we receive notice of such default from the requisite holders of the UPCH Notes, until in each case
the earliest of (a) the date on which such default is cured or waived or (b) 180 days from the date such default
occurs (and only one such notice may be given during any 360 day period).

LGE Financing, as lender of the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans, will also agree under the

UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans not to take any prohibited action with respect to the UPC Holding
Subordinated Shareholder Loans, including actions that would cause the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder
Loans not to constitute Subordinated Shareholder Loans under the indentures for the UPCH Notes. The
provisions of the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans will result in the UPC Holding Subordinated
Shareholder Loans constituting Subordinated Shareholder Loans for purposes of the indentures for the UPCH
Notes.

If at any time on or before the UPCH Notes are paid in full, LGE Financing, as lender of the UPC Holding

Subordinated Shareholder Loans, or any other subordinated creditor of UPC Broadband receives in respect or on
account of any liabilities under the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans or any other indebtedness
subordinated pursuant to the terms of the UPC Holding Subordinated Shareholder Loans a payment or
distribution other than in accordance with the terms of the indentures for the UPCH Notes, including any
payment or distribution by UPC Holding upon its winding-up, LGE Financing or such other subordinated
creditor, as the case may be, will promptly turn over to the trustee all such amounts received in violation of the
indentures for the UPCH Notes for application in accordance with the applicable provisions of the security
documents and the indentures for the UPCH Notes. UPC Holding is permitted under the terms of the indentures
for the UPCH Notes to incur debt which ranks pari passu with the UPCH Notes on a secured or unsecured basis.

**_UPC Broadband Holding Intercompany Loans_**

UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding are parties to a framework agreement dated October 31, 2000

under which UPC Holding from time to time provides intercompany loans to UPC Broadband Holding, each of
which are pledged on a first ranking basis to the lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.
Pursuant to the terms of the pledge agreement, upon an Insolvency Event (as defined therein) occurring in respect
of a member of the Borrower Group (as defined therein), the claims of UPC Holding under the framework
agreement shall be subordinated in all respects to the secured obligations owed by the borrower and other
obligors, to the lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. As of December 31, 2014, UPC
Broadband Holding had outstanding intercompany loans payable to UPC Holding of €6.7 billion. The UPC

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

UPCB Finance IV Limited (the “Issuer”) will issue $800 million of its 5.375% senior secured notes due

2025 (the “Dollar Notes”) and will concurrently issue €416.5 million (or more) of its senior secured notes due
2027 (the “Euro Notes”, together with the Dollar Note (as the context may require), the “Notes”) under an
indenture (the “Indenture”) to be entered into between, among others, the Issuer, The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and security agent, in a private transaction that is not subject
to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”). The
terms of the Notes will include those stated in the Indenture. The Notes Security Documents referred to below
under the caption “—Security” define the terms of the mortgages, charges and/or assignments that will secure the
Notes.

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading “Certain

Definitions”. In this description:

(1) the term “UPC Broadband Holding” refers only to UPC Broadband Holding B.V. and not to any of
its subsidiaries;

(2) the term “UPC Holding” refers only to UPC Holding B.V., the direct parent of UPC Broadband

Certain additional defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and refers to the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Finco Accession Agreements, the Deed of Covenant and the Notes
Security Documents. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Finco Accession Agreements, the Deed of Covenant and the Notes
Security Documents because they, and not this description, define your direct and indirect rights as holders of the
Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Finco Accession Agreements, the
Deed of Covenant and the Notes Security Documents are available as described below under “—Additional
_Information”. The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is attached as Annex A to this Offering Memorandum._
Forms of each Finco Accession Agreement and the Deed of Covenant are attached as Annex B and Annex C to
this Offering Memorandum, respectively.

The Notes will initially not be held in definitive form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated as

the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Structure of the Offering of the Dollar Notes hereby and the Concurrent Euro**
**Notes Offering**

In connection with the offering of the Dollar Notes hereby and the Concurrent Euro Notes Offering, the Issuer

will enter into two Finco Accession Agreements with UPC Financing and the facility agent under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility pursuant to which the Issuer will make available to UPC Financing (i) an additional facility
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the
Euro Notes issued in the offering and (ii) an additional facility under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility in a
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes issued in the offering. On the Issue Date,
the Issuer will advance the net proceeds of the issuance of the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes, together with the fees
payable to it by UPC Financing under the Fee Letter (as defined herein), to UPC Financing pursuant to the relevant
Finco Accession Agreement.

The Issuer, as a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (a “UPCB Lender”), will be

treated the same as all other lenders under that facility and will have benefits, rights and protections that are
similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other UPCB Lenders. Through the covenants in the
Indenture and the security interests over all of the issued shares of the Issuer and each Finco Loan granted to the
Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes, the holders of Notes will be provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and protections granted to the
Issuer as a UPCB Lender, including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained in the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility and the security granted for the benefit of the UPCB Lenders. See “Description of the
_UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”. Thus, in the case of the ongoing obligations of the UPCB Group under_

134


-----

the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Issuer will be treated in the same way as the other UPCB Lenders,
with the right to vote as part of the lending group on the basis described in this Description of the Notes and to receive
principal and interest on the Finco Loans, which it will in turn use to make payments on the Notes. For a description of
procedures under the Indenture and the Finco Accession Agreements regarding voting rights of holders of the Notes
with respect to decisions under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see below under “—Amendment,
_Supplement and Waiver—To the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or the Finco Accession Agreements”._

Under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, to the extent the UPCB Group is in compliance with

certain financial ratios, the borrowers under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, at their discretion and
without the consent of the UPCB Lenders, are permitted to incur additional pari passu indebtedness pursuant to
additional facilities under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, which benefit from the protections
provided to all UPCB Lenders, including the representations and warranties, covenants, guarantees and security
provided thereunder. For a further description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see “Description of
_the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”. The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is attached as Annex A_
to this Offering Memorandum.

However, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility limits the ability of the UPCB Group to directly issue

the Notes. As a result, we have implemented the structure for this offering pursuant to which the Issuer will loan
the proceeds of this offering of the Notes to UPC Financing, thus indirectly affording holders of Notes the ability
to participate in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

On the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes (together with the fees payable to the Issuer

from UPC Financing under the Fee Letter) will be used by the Issuer to fund (i) a loan (the “Finco Loan AK”)
borrowed under an additional facility (the “Finco Facility AK”) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility,
and (ii) a loan (the “Finco Loan AL”, together with the Finco Loan AK, the “Finco Loans”) borrowed under an
additional facility (the “Finco Facility AL”, together with the Finco Facility AK, the “Finco Facilities”) under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, and the Issuer will become a UPCB Lender. In addition to indirect benefits
arising from the protections and security afforded to the Issuer as a UPCB Lender, holders of Notes will also benefit
directly from the first ranking security interests in the Collateral, as described below under “—Security”.

The principal amount of the Euro Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and

currency, among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan AK. The
principal amount of the Dollar Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and currency,
among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the Finco Loan AL.

Further, if an Event of Default is continuing under the Indenture or the Notes, holders of Notes will be

entitled to direct the Trustee and/or the Security Agent to enforce their rights under the Notes, the Indenture and
the Note Security Documents, in which case the holders of Notes will have multiple available remedies (through
the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, where relevant), including:

   - declaring the Notes due and payable (other than an Event of Default arising from a UPCB Event of
Default (as defined below under “—Events of Default and Remedies—Events of Default”));

   - enforcing all rights available to the Issuer as a UPCB Lender, subject to any limitations set forth in the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility;

   - enforcing the security over the shares of the Issuer and directing performance by the Issuer of its
obligations under certain agreements and other documents to which it is a party;

   - requiring the Issuer to sell one or both Finco Loans to third parties; and/or

   - exchanging their Notes for UPCB Loans.

For more information on Events of Default and Remedies, see “—Events of Default and Remedies”.

**_The Finco Loans_**

The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes (together with the fees payable to the Issuer by UPC

Financing under the Fee Letter) will be used by the Issuer to fund the Finco Loans pursuant to the Finco
Facilities under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. As of December 31, 2014, as adjusted to give effect
to (i) the borrowing of the Finco Loans and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of
_Proceeds”, (ii) the Early 2015 Refinancings, and (iii) the Refinancing, €3,736.0 million carrying amount of_
indebtedness would have been outstanding under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility on a non-eliminated
basis, which includes amounts outstanding under Facilities AC, AD and the Finco Loans that are eliminated

135


-----

through the consolidation of the lenders thereof within UPC Holding’s consolidated financial statements. See
“Capitalization”. This amount also includes €1.2 billion, or 32% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding
under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility on a non-eliminated basis, representing the Finco Loans, which
is eliminated through the consolidation of the Issuer within UPC Holding’s consolidated financial statements.

**_Certain Transaction Documents_**

_Finco Accession Agreements. In connection with the Finco Loan AK, the Issuer and UPC Financing will enter_

into an accession agreement (the “Finco Accession Agreement AK”) and connection with the Finco Loan AL, the
Issuer and UPC Financing will enter into an accession agreement (the “Finco Accession Agreement AL”, together
with the Finco Accession Agreement AK, the “Finco Accession Agreements”), pursuant to each of which the
Issuer will accede to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility as a UPCB Lender. The Finco Accession
Agreement AK will set out the principal economic terms of the Finco Facility AK and the Finco Accession
Agreement AL will set out the principal economic terms of the Finco Facility AL. The form of the Facility AL
Finco Accession Agreement to be entered into on the Issue Date is attached as Annex B to this Offering
Memorandum.

Upon acceding to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility pursuant to the Finco Accession Agreements,

the Issuer will benefit from all the rights of a lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, including
the protections of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default set out in the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility. In addition, the Finco Loans will be secured by the assets of the UPCB Group
granted to the UPCB Security Agent to secure the UPCB Loans.

Each Finco Accession Agreement will be similar in form to the accession agreement entered into by other

UPCB Lenders and will include additional rights that are specific to the relevant Finco Loan, including the maturity
date of, the rate of interest accruing on, and the interest periods applicable to the relevant Finco Loan. In addition,
each Finco Accession Agreement will provide for the payment of certain premiums in connection with certain
voluntary and mandatory prepayments of the relevant Finco Loan that will enable the Issuer to pay the premiums
applicable to redemptions of the Notes, as described below under “—Redemption and Repurchase”. Each Finco
Accession Agreement will also include the consent of the Issuer to certain amendments under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility if the borrowers seek a consent to those amendments from the UPCB Lenders, as described
below under “—Finco Accession Agreement and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility”. Each Finco Accession
Agreement will constitute a “Finance Document” for purposes of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

_Fee Letter. The Issuer and UPC Financing will enter into a fee letter (the “Fee Letter”) relating to the_

payment of certain fees to the Issuer. The Issuer will allocate a portion of such fees equal to the original issue
discount on the Notes (if any) to UPC Financing under the Finco Loans so that the principal amount of the Finco
Loan AK equals the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes issued in this offering and the principal
amount of the Finco Loan AK equals the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes issued in this offering.

_Deed of Covenant. Under a deed of covenant between the Issuer, UPC Financing and UPC Broadband_

Holding (the “Deed of Covenant”), UPC Broadband Holding will contractually agree to ensure the compliance
by the Issuer with certain covenants included in the Indenture. The form of the Deed of Covenant is attached as
Annex C to this Offering Memorandum.

_UPC Expenses Agreement. Under an amended and restated expenses agreement (the “UPC Expenses_

**Agreement”), Liberty Global B.V. (formerly known as Liberty Global Europe B.V.) (“LGE”), an affiliate of UPC**
Holding and an entity not subject to the covenants of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, has agreed to pay
certain obligations of the Issuer, including in respect of the maintenance of the Issuer’s existence, the payment of
certain tax liabilities of the Issuer, the payment of Additional Amounts pursuant to the Indenture following certain tax
events and the payment of additional interest required to be paid under the Notes on overdue principal and interest.

The Finco Accession Agreements, the Fee Letter, the Deed of Covenant and the UPC Expenses Agreement

are collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction Documents”.

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes:

   - will be general obligations of the Issuer;

   - will be secured by the Collateral; and

   - will rank pari passu in right of payment to all Financial Indebtedness of the Issuer that is not
subordinated to the Notes.

136

The Issuer will not be entitled to incur any additional Financial Indebtedness (other than Additional Notes).

See “—Certain Covenants—Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the Issuer”.

**The Issuer**

The Issuer has been formed as a special purpose financing company for the primary purpose of facilitating the

offering of the Notes. All of the Issuer’s issued shares are held by the Share Trustee as share trustee pursuant to the
Shareholder Trust, which is a trust established under the laws of the Cayman Islands in respect of the issued shares of the
Issuer. The Issuer has no material business operations and upon completion of this offering will have no material assets

(4) rights under the UPC Expenses Agreement, pursuant to which LGE will agree to pay or procure the
payment of (i) the fees and expenses of the Issuer incurred from time to time in connection with or related to

(ii) certain tax liabilities of the Issuer, (iii) any Additional Amounts, if any, payable under the Indenture and
(iv) any additional interest required to be paid under the Notes on overdue principal and interest.

In the event the Euro Notes are issued at a price less than par, the Finco Loan AK will be advanced at its

face amount and in the event the Dollar Notes are issued at a price less than par, the Finco Loan AL will be
advanced at its face amount. The difference between the cash proceeds received by the Issuer in respect of the
issue of the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes, as applicable, and the face amount of the relevant loan to UPC
Financing will be accounted for as an upfront fee under the Fee Letter.

Under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, UPCB Lenders are not allowed to split or divide their

votes with respect to matters arising thereunder requiring the vote (or other consent) of UPCB Lenders. For a
description of procedures under the Indenture regarding voting rights of holders of the Euro Notes and the Dollar
Notes with respect to decisions under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see below under “—
_Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or the Finco Accession_

The above description is intended to summarise certain material amendments included in each Finco

Accession Agreement but is not complete and exhaustive and does not restate the proposed amendments listed in
schedule 3 of each Finco Accession Agreement in their entirety. Given the significant nature of these
amendment, you should read the full list of amendments set out in schedule 3 of the Facility AL Finco Accession
Agreement listed in Annex B of this Offering Memorandum in their entirety before investing in the Notes. See
“Risk Factors—By investing in the Dollar Notes you will have provided advanced consent to the UPC Broadband
_Holding Bank Facility Amendments which will automatically become effective without any further consent from_
_holders of the Dollar Notes upon UPC Broadband Holding obtaining the consent of either the Majority Lenders_
_(as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility) or, with respect to certain amendments, all UPCB_
_Lenders”._

As a result, the Issuer will not solicit votes (or other consents) from the holders of Euro Notes and the Dollar

Notes with respect to these matters (the “Required Consent Provisions”). In addition, the Issuer will not be
entitled to receive, and will expressly waive under each Finco Accession Agreement any right it may have to, any
consent, waiver, amendment or other similar fee that may be paid to other UPCB Lenders in connection with
their approval of the Required Consent Provisions.

References in this Description of the Notes and the Indenture to numbered clauses or sections in the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility refer to such clauses or sections as numbered as of the date of the Indenture
and, in the event the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is amended or supplemented after the date of the
Indenture, to any substantially similar clause or section after such amendment or supplement whether numbered
the same or differently after such amendment or supplement.

For a further description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see “Description of the UPC

_Broadband Holding Bank Facility”._

**Security**

Each Finco Loan will be secured by the assets of the UPCB Group granted to the UPCB Security Agent to

secure the UPCB Loans. The UPCB Loans are primarily secured by way of a pledge over the shares in each holding
company subsidiary located in each of the main jurisdictions in which the UPCB Group operates. In addition, pledges
over certain intercompany receivables have also been granted. For a description of the security with respect to the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see “Description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility—Security”.

In addition, subject to limitations under Cayman Islands law described below, the holders of the relevant

series of Notes will benefit directly from first ranking security interests to be granted to the Security Agent on
behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the relevant series of Notes in the following rights, property and assets
(collectively, the “Collateral”):

(1) all of the issued shares of the Issuer (the “Issuer Share Collateral”);

(2) all of the assets of the Issuer (excluding the proceeds of the paid up share capital of the Issuer and any
transaction fees payable to the Issuer pursuant to the UPC Expenses Agreement and excluding as
provided below), including:

(a) the Issuer’s rights to and benefit in the relevant Finco Loan (including all rights of the Issuer as a
UPCB Lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the relevant Finco Accession
Agreement) (the “UPCB Loan Collateral”);

(b) the Issuer’s rights under the Deed of Covenant (the “Deed of Covenant Collateral”);

141


-----

(c) the Issuer’s rights under the Fee Letter (the “UPCB Fee Letter Collateral”);

(d) the Issuer’s rights under the UPC Expenses Agreement (excluding the Issuer’s rights to be
indemnified in respect of fees, costs, expenses and any other amounts payable to parties that do
not benefit from the security interests in the Collateral) (the “UPC Expenses Agreement
**Collateral”); and**

(e) sums of money held from time to time in all bank accounts of the Issuer (excluding the bank
account (the “Share Capital Account”) in which the Issuer has deposited the proceeds of its share
capital ($250.00) and the transaction fee ($250.00)) (the “Bank Account Collateral”).

The Security Agent will enter into the Notes Security Documents relating to the Collateral described above

with the other relevant parties thereto. The first ranking security interests in the Collateral will secure the
performance of the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes as provided in the relevant Notes
Security Document and to the extent specified therein, subject to the provisions, among others, described below
under “—Events of Default and Remedies” and “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”.

The Notes Security Documents provide for the Security Agent to release the security created thereby upon

discharge of the Indenture, in accordance with its terms, as described below under “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge”._

**Limited Recourse Obligations**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Security Documents to which it is

a party will be limited as set forth in the Indenture. All payments to be made by the Issuer under the Indenture
(including any Additional Amounts), the Notes and the Notes Security Documents to which it is a party will be
made only from and to the extent of such sums received or recovered by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Trustee or
the Security Agent under the Collateral, including the Issuer’s right under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility and the Transaction Documents and none of the Trustee, the Security Agent, any Paying Agent, any
Registrar or the holders of Notes will have any further recourse to the Issuer in respect thereof in the event that
the amount due and payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Security Documents
exceeds the amounts so received or recovered under the Collateral, including the Issuer’s right under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the Transaction Documents.

In addition, holders of the Notes will not have a direct claim on the cash flow or assets of any member of the

UPCB Group and no member of the UPCB Group will have any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay
amounts due under the Notes, or to make funds available to the Issuer for those payments, other than the
obligations of UPC Financing to make payments to UPCB Lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility and the Finco Accession Agreements.

Because the holders of Notes will benefit from the assignment of rights under certain agreements between

the Issuer and members of the UPCB Group, in certain circumstances described below under “—Events of
_Default and Remedies”, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, will be able to assert the_
contractual rights of the Issuer against members of the UPCB Group (and in an enforcement action holders of
Notes may instruct the Security Agent to demand such performance); however, these rights are limited to the
Issuer’s contractual rights against the UPCB Group and provide for no direct claims into the UPCB Group.

No member of the UPCB Group will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue in this offering $800 million in aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes, and will

concurrently issue €416.5 million (or more) in aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes in the Concurrent Euro
Notes Offering. The Issuer may issue Additional Euro Notes (the “Additional Euro Notes”) and Additional
Dollar Notes (the “Additional Dollar Notes”, together with the Additional Euro Notes, the “Additional Notes”)
under the Indenture from time to time after the Concurrent Euro Notes Offering and this offering, as applicable.
Any issuance of Additional Notes will be subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture. The Euro Notes and any
Additional Euro Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes
under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, consents, other determinations and
redemptions. The Dollar Notes and any Additional Dollar Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be
treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments,
consents, other determinations and redemptions. Any reference to Notes in this Description of the Notes shall be
deemed to include any Additional Notes. In connection with the issuance of Additional Notes, UPC Financing

142


-----

will enter into one or more accession agreements under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, each of
which will constitute a “Finco Accession Agreement” for purposes of the Indenture and related documents. The
proceeds of any such Additional Notes will be loaned to UPC Financing pursuant to a loan under such Finco
Accession Agreement, each such loan will constitute a “Finco Loan” for purposes of the Indenture and related
documents. Consideration for any Additional Notes may be paid in cash, in exchange for existing UPCB Loans
or otherwise.

The Issuer will issue Euro Notes in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in

excess thereof. The Euro Notes will mature on January 15, 2027. The Issuer will issue Dollar Notes in minimum
denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Dollar Notes will mature on
January 15, 2025.

Interest on the Euro Notes will accrue at the rate to be specified at the pricing of the Euro Notes and interest

on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of 5.375% per annum. Interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears
on each January 15 and July 15, commencing on January 15, 2016.

Interest on overdue principal and interest then due will accrue at a rate that is 1.0% higher than the then

applicable interest rate on the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the UPC Expenses Agreement described above,
LGE will make payments to the Issuer to enable it to pay the additional interest required to be paid under the
Notes on overdue principal and interest. The Issuer will make each interest payment for so long as the Notes are
Global Notes to the holders of Book-Entry Interests in the Notes at the close of business (in the relevant clearing
system) on the Clearing System Business Day immediately before the due date for such payment, where
“Clearing System Business Day” means a day on which each clearing system for which the Global Note is
being held is open for business, or to the extent Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, to the holders of
record of the Notes on the immediately preceding preceding January 1 and July 1. Interest will be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Principal, premium, if any, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes issued in certificated non
global form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the office of the Principal Paying Agent in
London, England, in respect of the Euro Notes, and at the office of the Paying Agent in New York, New York, in
respect of the Dollar Notes, except that, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest may be made by check
mailed to the address of the holders of Definitive Registered Notes as such address appears in the register for
Definitive Registered Notes. Such holders must surrender their Definitive Registered Notes to a Paying Agent to
collect principal payments.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such

payment is due to be paid, the holders thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a
result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes in each of

(a) London, England (the “Principal Paying Agent”) and (b) the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York. The
Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch will initially act as Paying Agent in London and The Bank of New
York Mellon will initially act as Paying Agent in New York.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) for so long as the Notes are listed on

the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on its Global Exchange Market and the rules
of the Irish Stock Exchange so require. The Issuer will also maintain a transfer agent. The initial Registrar for the
Euro Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon (Luxembourg) S.A. in Luxembourg and the initial Registrar for
the Dollar Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon. The initial transfer agents with respect to the Euro Notes
will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch and The Bank of New York Mellon (Luxembourg) S.A.
and the initial transfer agent with respect to the Dollar Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon. The Registrar
will maintain a register on behalf of the Issuer for so long as the Notes remain outstanding reflecting ownership of
Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time. The Paying Agents will make payments on, and the
transfer agents will facilitate transfer of, Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. In the event that the
Notes are no longer listed, the Issuer or its agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes. The
Issuer may change a Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes without prior notice to the holders of
Notes, and the Issuer may act as Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for the Notes.

143


-----

In addition, the Issuer undertakes that it will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a Member State of

the European Union that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive
2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the European Council of Economics and
Finance Ministers (“ECOFIN”) meeting of November 26-27, 2000 or any law implementing or complying with,
or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.

Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon

transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other

procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only (i) in the case of Euro Notes, in minimum

denominations of €100,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the
case of Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates,
opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based
upon directions received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will,
except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance with applicable
law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and
described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be

transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, (i) in the case of Euro Notes, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of Dollar
Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 principal amount, and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or
exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to
furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection
with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other
than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive Registered

Note in registered form:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any Interest Payment Date.

The Issuer, the Trustee and the Paying Agents will be entitled to treat the registered holder as the owner of it

for all purposes.

**Security Agent**

The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch will act as Security Agent under the Notes Security

Documents until such time, if any, that a new Security Agent is appointed under the relevant provisions of the
Indenture.

Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,

attorneys or agents will be responsible or liable for the existence, genuineness, value or protection of any property
securing the Notes, for the legality, enforceability, effectiveness or sufficiency of the Notes Security Documents,
for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any security interest under any Notes Security
Document, or for any defect or deficiency as to any such matters, or for any failure to demand, collect, foreclose
or realize upon or otherwise enforce any of the Notes Security Documents or any delay in doing so.

**Redemption and Repurchase**

**_Disposal Proceeds_**

Under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing are

required to prepay, or to procure that there is prepaid (in either case, unless otherwise waived in accordance with
the provisions of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility), the Additional Facilities under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility with certain proceeds of asset disposals (“Disposal Proceeds”), subject to
certain exceptions. See paragraph (d) under “Description of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility—
_Mandatory Prepayment”. UPC Broadband Holding may elect which Additional Facility or Additional Facilities_
are to be prepaid in connection with any mandatory prepayment with Disposal Proceeds. Under the Deed of
Covenant, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing will agree that, with respect to each Finco Loan and any
Disposal Proceeds that are required to be applied to prepay any Additional Facilities pursuant to Clause 7.6
(Mandatory prepayment from disposal proceeds) of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, an amount of

-----

such Disposal Proceeds that bears the same proportion to the total Disposal Proceeds as the aggregate principal
amount that such Finco Loan bears to the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding UPCB Loans (the
“Available Disposal Proceeds”) will be available for prepayment of such Finco Loan.

In respect of the Available Disposal Proceeds, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing will elect, at

their option:

(1) to offer to prepay (i) a principal amount of the Finco Loan AK equal to the lesser of (a) the amount of
the Available Disposal Proceeds and (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes tendered in
an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below) to be made by the Issuer following receipt of notice from UPC
Broadband Holding as set forth below and (ii) a principal amount of the Finco Loan AL equal to the
lesser of (a) the amount of the Available Disposal Proceeds and (b) the aggregate principal amount of
the Dollar Notes tendered in an Asset Sale Offer to be made by the Issuer following receipt of notice
from UPC Broadband Holding as set forth below; or

(2) prepay the Finco Loans pro rata in an amount equal to the Available Disposal Proceeds, in which case
the Issuer will redeem (i) an aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes equal to the amount of the
Finco Loan AK prepaid and (ii) an aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes equal to the amount
of the Finco Loan AL prepaid,

in each case, as described below.

**_Asset Sale Offer_**

Following receipt of notice of an asset disposal from UPC Broadband Holding delivered pursuant to

Clause 2.1(a)(i)(A) of the Deed of Covenant, the Issuer will, within five Business Days of receipt of such notice,
make an offer to all holders of Notes (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum principal amount of
Notes that may be purchased out of the Available Disposal Proceeds stated in such notice at an offer price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date, which offer price will be payable in cash.

Under the Deed of Covenant, UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Financing have agreed to pay (or procure

the payment of) an amount of the Finco Loans pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of the relevant
series of Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer equal to the lesser of (i) the Available Disposal Proceeds and
(ii) the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer, and the Issuer will accept for
purchase an equal aggregate principal amount of the Notes in such Asset Sale Offer. The Issuer will apply any
such prepayment of the Finco Loans, together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the relevant Finco Loan to
the date of prepayment, to pay the purchase price of all Notes accepted for purchase in such Asset Sale Offer.

The Issuer will promptly notify UPC Broadband Holding of the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered in

such Asset Sale Offer. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered in such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount
of the Available Disposal Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the
amounts tendered (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form, based on the procedures of the applicable depository).

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other

securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Redemption with Disposal Proceeds_**

Under the Deed of Covenant, if UPC Broadband and UPC Financing elect not to offer to prepay the Finco

Loans in an amount equal to the lesser of the Available Disposal Proceeds and the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes tendered in a related Asset Sale Offer, they are required to prepay (or procure the payment of) the
Finco Loans in an amount equal to the Available Disposal Proceeds, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the
Finco Loans at the applicable prepayment price for any voluntary prepayment to the date of prepayment. UPC
Broadband and UPC Financing are required to give not less than 10 Business Days’ notice of any such
prepayment. Any prepayments pursuant to this provision shall be pro rata across the Finco Loans.

146


-----

Following receipt of prepayment of the Finco Loan described in the preceding paragraph, the Issuer will

promptly redeem an aggregate principal amount of the relevant series of Notes equal to the redemption price that
would be payable if such Notes were redeemed on such date pursuant to the provisions described below under
“—Optional Redemption”, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date.

Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the relevant Finco Accession Agreement, the relevant Finco Accession

to the premiums payable to holders of the relevant series of Notes upon early redemption, as described below.

In each case below, any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to satisfaction

of one or more conditions precedent. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on
or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the Person in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date and no additional interest will be

**_Special Optional Redemption in connection with a UPC Exchange Transaction_**

At any time following the Issue Date and subject to its compliance with the UPC Broadband Holding Bank

Facility and the other agreements to which it is subject, UPC Broadband Holding or UPC Financing may at its
option initiate a UPC Exchange Transaction, pursuant to which it will make an offer to all holders of the Euro
Notes and/or Dollar Notes to exchange their Euro Notes and/or Dollar Notes, as applicable, for senior secured
notes issued by UPC Broadband Holding or UPC Financing.

If, among other requirements, holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding

Euro Notes and/or Dollar Notes elect to participate in such UPC Exchange Transaction and UPC Broadband
Holding or UPC Financing, as the case may be, accepts for exchange all Euro Notes and/or Dollar Notes, as
applicable, tendered in such UPC Exchange Transaction, UPC Broadband Holding or UPC Financing, as the case
may be, will be entitled to prepay all, but not less than all, of the remaining principal amount of the
corresponding Finco Loan AK and/or Finco Loan AL, as applicable, outstanding without the requirement to pay
the “make-whole” or other early prepayment amounts that it would otherwise be required to pay in the event of a
voluntary redemption of such corresponding Finco Loan. In order to effect any such prepayment, either UPC

149


-----

Broadband Holding or UPC Financing, as the case may be, is required to give notice of such prepayment to the
Issuer not later than three Business Days prior to the completion of such UPC Exchange Transaction and make
such prepayment on the completion date of such UPC Exchange Transaction. To the extent the Euro Notes and/
or Dollar Notes are exchanged as part of the UPC Exchange Transaction, redeemed through the special optional
redemption (as described below) or otherwise prepaid, UPC Financing’s obligation to repay the corresponding
amount of the Finco Loan AK and/or Finco Loan AL, as applicable, will be automatically discharged.

For a description of the requirements of any such exchange offer and certain required terms of such senior

secured notes, see “UPC Exchange Transaction” and “UPC Qualified Notes” under “—Certain Definitions”.

The Issuer will redeem all, but not less than all, of the Euro Notes and/or Dollar Notes issued under the

Indenture not exchanged in the UPC Exchange Transaction on the date of the prepayment of the corresponding Finco
Loan AK and/or Finco Loan AL, as applicable, described above, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

In the event that UPC Broadband Holding consummates a UPC Exchange Transaction, in connection therewith,

UPC Broadband Holding expects to enter into an intercreditor agreement with its senior creditors to regulate, among
other things, such creditors’ rights with respect to shared collateral, including with respect to enforcement of such
collateral. UPC Broadband Holding expects that any UPC Qualified Notes issued in such UPC Exchange Transaction
will be subject to the terms of that intercreditor agreement. While the terms of any intercreditor agreement will be
subject to negotiation among UPC Broadband Holding and its creditors, UPC Broadband Holding expects the principal
terms thereof to be consistent with those terms set forth in Annex D to this Offering Memorandum.

**_Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

Upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event effected at any time following the occurrence of an

Issuer Tax Event (as defined below) or an optional prepayment of the Finco Loans pursuant to Clause 7.9(a)(i)
(Right of prepayment and cancellation in relation to a single Lender) of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility (a “UPCB Tax Event”), the Issuer may redeem the relevant series of Notes, in whole but not in part, at
its discretion at any time, upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes
(which notice will be irrevocable and given in accordance with the procedures described in “—Selection and
_Notice”), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest_
then due on the Notes redeemed to the applicable redemption date (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the
rights of holders of the relevant series of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date), if, in the case of an Issuer Tax Event only, on the next date on which any amount would
be payable in respect of the Notes, the Issuer is or would be required to pay Additional Amounts as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction),

and the Issuer cannot avoid any such payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available. For this

purpose, reasonable measures shall not include the Issuer changing or moving jurisdictions.

In the case of an Issuer Tax Event, the Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than

90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if
a payment in respect of the relevant series of Notes were then due. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may
not redeem the Notes under this provision if the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction changes under the Indenture and the
Issuer is obligated to pay any Additional Amounts as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or
treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder), or any change in official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings, of the then current
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction which, at the time such Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became the applicable Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction under the Indenture, was publicly announced or formally proposed. Prior to the publication or, where
relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the relevant series of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer
will deliver to the Trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that there has been such change or amendment. In
addition, before the Issuer publishes or mails notice of redemption of such Notes as described above, it will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that it cannot avoid its obligation to pay Additional

150


-----

Amounts by the Issuer taking reasonable measures (for this purpose, reasonable measures shall not include the
Issuer changing or moving jurisdictions) available to it.

The Trustee is entitled to accept such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of

the satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding
on the holders of the relevant series of Notes.

The foregoing provisions regarding redemption for changes in withholding taxes will apply mutatis

_mutandis to any successor to the Issuer after such successor person becomes a party to the Indenture._

**Open Market Purchases of UPCB Loans**

In the event that any member of the UPCH Group makes any offer to purchase or otherwise acquire any

UPCB Loans (whether through a tender offer process or other process) at a price below the relevant prevailing
market price for such UPCB Loans, and such offer includes all or a portion of the Finco Loans held by the Issuer,
the Issuer shall make a contemporaneous offer to purchase the relevant series of Notes on substantially similar
terms as the offer to purchase UPCB Loans; provided that (1) in no event will holders of such Notes be required
to participate in any such offer, (2) the consideration offered to holders of such Notes will not be less than the
consideration they would have received as UPCB Lenders in connection with such offer to purchase UPCB
Loans and (3) UPC Broadband Holding and/or the Issuer shall have confirmed to the Trustee that such purchases
will not result in taxable income for the Issuer, including upon the extinguishment of Financial Indebtedness in
connection therewith, or that UPC Broadband Holding or LGE will have agreed to pay such income tax payable.
Prior to undertaking any such repurchases, one or more members of the UPCH Group will enter into
arrangements providing for the payment of any fees and expenses incurred in connection with any such offer.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes or any series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select

Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form, based on the procedures
of the applicable depository) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange requirements. The
Trustee will not be liable for selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

No Euro Notes of €100,000 can be redeemed in part and no Dollar Notes of $200,000 can be redeemed in

part. Notices of redemption will be delivered to holders through the applicable clearing systems in accordance
with the procedures specified above. Notices of redemption may not be conditional.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the

portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note, in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the Note, will be issued in the name of the holder of the Note upon cancellation of the
original Note, as applicable. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes which have been redeemed on
such redemption date.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as

applicable, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any
Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of the Irish Stock Exchange so require, any such notice
to the holders of the Notes will also be published by the Companies Announcement Office of the Irish Stock
Exchange and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer (or UPC Broadband Holding on behalf of the
Issuer) will notify the Irish Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer or any successor thereto (a “Payor”) on or with respect to the Notes will

be made without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, (including interest or
penalties to the extent resulting from a failure by the Issuer to timely pay amounts due) duties, assessments or
governmental charges of whatever nature (“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then
required by law or by the official interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or
on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

151


-----

(1) the Cayman Islands, The Netherlands or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes is made, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax
purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to the Notes (an “Issuer Tax
**Event”), including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, the Payor will make**
such deduction or withholding, make payment of the amount so withheld to the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction and pay such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in
order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each holder of the Notes, as the case
may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts) equals the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments
in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts
will be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner and the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes (other than the mere ownership or holding of such Note or enforcement of
rights thereunder or under the Indenture or the receipt of payments in respect thereof);

(b) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the failure of the holder or beneficial
owner of such Note to make a declaration of non-residence or any other claim or filing for
exemption to which it is entitled, provided that (x) such declaration of non-residence or other
claim or filing for exemption is required by the applicable law of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction as
a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold all or a part of any such
Taxes and (y) at least 30 days prior to the first payment date with respect to which such
declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing for exemption is required under the applicable
law of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, the relevant holder at that time has been notified (in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture) by the Payor or any other person
through whom payment may be made that a declaration of non-residence or other claim or filing
for exemption is required to be made;

(c) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented during such 30-day period);

(d) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

(e) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(f) any Taxes withheld or deducted imposed on a payment required to be withheld or deducted
pursuant to the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other directive implementing the
conclusions of the ECOFIN meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income
or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such directive;

(g) any Taxes which could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) of
the relevant Note to another paying agent in a member state of the European Union;

(h) all United States backup withholding taxes;

(i) any withholding or deduction imposed pursuant to (a) Sections 1471 through 1474 of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended), as of the date of the Indenture (or any
amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to
comply with) and any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, (b) any
treaty, law, regulation or other official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction, or relating to an
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and any other jurisdiction, which (in
either case) facilitates the implementation of (a) above, or (c) any agreement pursuant to the
implementation of (a) or (b) above with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. government
or any governmental or taxation authority in any other jurisdiction; and

152


-----

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the

holder of the Note, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of
clauses (a) to (j) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or

withheld to the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Tax Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies (or, if certified
copies are not available despite reasonable efforts of the Payor, other evidence of payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee) to each holder. The Payor will attach to each certified copy (or other evidence) a
certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of
such withholding Taxes paid per €1,000 or $1,000 principal amount of the Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as
applicable. Copies of such documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the
office of the Trustee by the holders of the Notes upon request and will be made available at the offices of the
Irish Listing Agent if the Notes are then listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and

payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to
such date, in which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts
with respect to such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
such Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information
necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date. Each such
Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officer’s Certificate addressing such matters.
The Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on each such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever mentioned in the Indenture, the Notes or this description of the Notes, in any context: (1) the

payment of principal, (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes, (3) interest, or (4) any other
amount payable on or with respect to the Notes, such reference will be deemed to include payment of Additional
Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or
would be payable in respect thereof.

In the event the Payor is required to pay Additional Amounts, pursuant to the terms of the UPC Expenses

Agreement, LGE will pay to the Payor an amount in cash equal to such Additional Amounts to enable the Payor
to make such payment.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property

taxes, charges or similar levies (including interest and penalties to the extent resulting from a failure by the Issuer
to timely pay amounts due) which arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any
Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt
of any payments with respect to the Notes, excluding any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any
jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or any jurisdiction in which a Paying Agent is located,
other than those resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, the
Collateral or any other such document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Notes.

The foregoing obligations regarding withholding taxes will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge

of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is
organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

corporate existence, in accordance with the its constitutional documents (as the same may be amended from time

154


-----

_Maintenance of Listing_

The Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to list and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Irish Stock

Exchange for so long as the Notes are outstanding; provided, however, that if at any time the Issuer is unable to
list the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange or if maintenance of such listing becomes unduly burdensome, it will,
prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Irish Stock Exchange, use its reasonable best efforts to list and
maintain a listing of the Notes on another internationally recognized stock exchange.

_Minimum Period for Consents under Loan Documents_

In the event that the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender under each Finco Loan, is eligible or required to vote (or

otherwise consent) with respect to any request by any member of the UPCB Group for any waiver, amendment or
supplement to any UPCB Loan Document or any other determination to be made by the UPCB Lenders, other
than with respect to the Required Consent Provisions, the Issuer will procure the agreement from the applicable
member of the UPCB Group that the period during which the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, will be eligible to
validly vote (or otherwise consent) with respect to any such waiver, amendment, supplement or determination
will not be less than 15 Business Days from the date when written request for such waiver, amendment or
supplement is first made to the UPCB Lenders. The Issuer will distribute, or cause to be distributed, to holders of
the relevant series of Notes and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note or otherwise make available
(including through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream) all documents related to any such waiver,

such waiver, amendment or supplement is first made to the UPCB Lenders.

_Payments for Consent_

_UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. Neither UPC Broadband Holding nor UPC Financing will, and_

UPC Broadband Holding will procure that no member of the UPCB Group will, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any UPCB Lender for or as an inducement to any
consent, waiver or amendment under any UPCB Loan Document which is subject to the consent of Majority
Lenders or all UPCB Lenders, other than the Required Consent Provisions, unless (i) such consideration is also
offered to be paid to the Issuer (as a UPCB Lender) and (ii) if the Issuer consents, waives or agrees to such
consent, waiver or amendment in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described below under “—
_Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or the Finco Accession_
_Agreements” in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating thereto (including any amendment_
or supplement thereto), the Issuer is paid such consideration. The Issuer will promptly pay any such
consideration received by it to all consenting holders of the relevant series of Notes on a pro rata basis.

_Indenture. The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the_

benefit of any holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver, amendment or supplement of any
of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid

frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver, amendment or supplement.

_Amendments to Loan Documents to be applied equally to all UPCB Lenders_

the then outstanding Euro Notes and/or Dollar Notes, as the case may be, in compliance with the provisions of

as if such amendment, waiver or supplement were subject to the majority consent provisions described
thereunder or (c) such amendment, waiver or supplement has been consented to by the requisite UPCB Lenders
(as determined in accordance with the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility), including the Issuer, but
irrespective of whether the Issuer, acting on the instructions of the holders of the relevant series of Notes in

_Information_

For so long as any Notes are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S.

Securities Act, the Issuer will, during any period in which it is neither subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S.
Exchange Act nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) thereunder, provide to any holder or
beneficial owner of such restricted securities or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted securities
designated by such holder or beneficial owner or to the Trustee for delivery to such holder, beneficial owner or
prospective purchaser, in each case upon the request of such holder, beneficial owner, prospective purchaser or
Trustee, the information satisfying the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Upon receipt from UPC Broadband Holding or the UPCB Facility Agent of any report or other information

pursuant to the terms of or in respect of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Issuer will promptly (and
in any event, within three Business Days of receipt) deliver any such report or other information to the holders of
Notes (provided, however, that to the extent any reports are filed on the SEC’s website, UPC Holding’s website
or UPC Broadband Holding’s website or Liberty Global’s website, such reports shall be deemed to be furnished
to the Trustee and the holders). In the event such reports or other information are furnished by or at the direction
of UPC Broadband Holding or the UPCB Facility Agent to “public” UPCB Lenders via an Internet website or an
electronic information provider, the Issuer shall procure that the Trustee, the holders of the Notes and BookEntry Interests are granted access to such website or electronic information supplier in order to receive such
reports or other information at the same time as other “public” UPCB Lenders.

The Issuer or UPC Broadband Holding will provide to the Trustee (provided, however, that to the extent any

reports are filed on the SEC’s website, UPC Holding’s website or UPC Broadband Holding’s or Liberty Global’s
website, such reports shall be deemed to be furnished to the Trustee and the holders), within 150 days after the
end of each fiscal year ending subsequent to the Issue Date, the audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer
as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years (or such shorter period as the Issuer has been in existence) and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of Issuer for the three most recent fiscal
years (or such shorter period as the Issuer has been in existence), in each case prepared in accordance with
GAAP, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements and a report of the independent auditors on
the financial statements.

The Issuer or UPC Broadband Holding is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding

compliance with the Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer or UPC
Broadband Holding is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default
and the action that is being taken in respect of such Default or Event of Default. The Issuer, UPC Broadband
Holding and LGE will promptly notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the holders of Notes and the holders of BookEntry Interests in the Notes upon becoming aware of any breach (or other event that would constitute or would be
reasonably likely to result in a default) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the relevant Finco
Accession Agreement, the Fee Letter, the Deed of Covenant or the UPC Expenses Agreement.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

**_Events of Default_**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any Note when due, which has continued
for 30 days;

(2) default for one Business Day in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of
the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer to comply with Clauses (4), (5), (7) or (11) under the captions “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations with Respect to Business Activities of the Issuer” or the provisions of “—_
_Certain Covenants—Maintenance of the Existence of the Issuer” or “—Certain Covenants—Minimum_
_Period for Consents under Loan Documents”;_

(4) failure by the Issuer for 60 days after notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or the holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding to comply with any of the agreements in the
Indenture (other than those described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above) or the Notes;

(5) breach by the Issuer or the Share Trustee of any material representation or warranty in any Notes
Security Document to which it is a party, the repudiation by the Issuer or the Share Trustee of any of its

156


-----

obligations under any Notes Security Document to which it is a party or the unenforceability for any
reason against the Issuer or the Share Trustee of any Notes Security Document to which it is a party;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Issuer;

(7) (a) failure by any party thereto for 60 days to comply with any of the agreements in the Deed of
Covenant, the UPC Expenses Agreement or the Fee Letter in any material respect or (b) the repudiation
by any party thereto of any of its obligations under any of the Deed of Covenant, the UPC Expenses
Agreement or the Fee Letter, the unenforceability for any reason against any party thereto of the Deed
of Covenant, the UPC Expenses Agreement or the Fee Letter or any breach by any party thereto of any
material representation or warranty in the Deed of Covenant, the UPC Expenses Agreement or the Fee
Letter; or

(8) (a) the occurrence of a UPCB Event of Default that is continuing or (b) any breach by UPC Broadband
Holding or UPC Financing of any material representation or warranty or any material agreement in the
Finco Accession Agreement AK or the Finco Accession Agreement AL.

For purposes of clause (8) above, “UPCB Event of Default” means an “Event of Default” as defined in the

UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility (including the Finco Accession Agreements) as then in effect.

**_Remedies_**

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to

the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If
any other Event of Default (other than any Event of Default described in Clause (8) above) occurs and is
continuing, (i) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Notes may
declare all the Euro Notes to be due and payable immediately and (ii) the holders of at least 25% in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Dollar Notes may declare all the Dollar Notes to be due and payable
immediately.

Whether or not the Notes are accelerated pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph,

if any Event of Default (other than any Event of Default described in Clause (8) above) occurs and is continuing,
any Lien over the Collateral granted under any Security Document will become enforceable; provided however,
if an Event of Default as described in Clause (8) above occurs and is continuing, any Lien over the (1) UPCB
Loan Collateral, (2) Deed of Covenant Collateral, and (3) Expenses Agreement Collateral granted under any
Security Document will become enforceable. If such Lien over the Collateral becomes enforceable, the Trustee
or Security Agent may at its discretion and shall if so requested in writing by holders representing at least 25% of
the principal amount of the Euro Notes and/or the Dollar Notes, as the case may be, then outstanding enforce
such Lien in any manner permitted by the Notes Security Documents, including taking possession of, appointing
a receiver in respect of and/or realizing all or any part of the Collateral. Pursuant to each Finco Accession
Agreement, UPC Broadband Holding has consented to any assignment, transfer or novation of rights and/or
obligations (in whole or in part) of the relevant Finco Loan following an Event of Default under the Indenture,
including any subsequent assignment, transfer or novation of the relevant Finco Loan, subject to minimum
transfer amount of €100,000 (in the case of Finco Loan AK) or $200,000 (in the case of Finco Loan AL) and
other requirements of a UPCB Lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Notes and/or Dollar Notes, as

the case may be, may direct the Trustee and/or the Security Agent in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee
and/or the Security Agent may withhold from holders of the relevant series of Notes notice of any continuing
Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of
Default relating to the payment of principal, interest, premium or Additional Amounts (if any).

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee and/or the Security Agent, in

case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee and/or the Security Agent will be under no
obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of
Euro Notes and or Dollar Notes, as the case may be, unless such holders have offered to the Trustee and/or the
Security Agent indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the
right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts (if any) when due, no
holder of a Note may pursue any remedy (other than the exchange of the relevant series of Notes for UPCB
Exchange Loans as described below) with respect to the Indenture or the relevant series of Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

157


-----

(2) holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Notes and/or Dollar
Notes, as applicable, have requested the Trustee and/or the Security Agent to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee and/or the Security Agent reasonable security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee and/or the Security Agent has not complied with such request within 60 days after the
receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Notes and/or Dollar
Notes, as applicable, have not given the Trustee and/or the Security Agent a direction inconsistent with
such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Notes and/or Dollar

Notes, as the case may be, by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the relevant series of
Notes, rescind an acceleration or an enforcement action or waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or
premium on, Additional Amounts with respect to, or the principal of, the relevant series of Notes.

Notwithstanding any provision in the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Security Documents or otherwise to the

contrary, the obligations of the Issuer to the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent,
the Registrar and the holders of the Notes under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Security Documents shall
be limited to the proceeds of the realization of the Collateral once the proceeds have been applied in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Security Documents. Having realized all the Collateral in
accordance with the Note Security Documents and distributed the net proceeds thereof in accordance with the
Indenture, none of the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and the holders of the
relevant series of Notes may take any further steps to recover any sum still unpaid in respect of such Notes, the
Indenture or any of the Note Security Documents or otherwise and all claims against the Issuer in respect of any
such sum due but still unpaid shall be extinguished.

**_Exchange of Notes for UPCB Loans_**

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture which is continuing (an “Exchange

**Triggering Event”), a holder of Notes may exchange all or part of its Notes (including in connection with a**
transfer to a third party) into a like aggregate principal amount of the relevant Finco Loan equal to the aggregate
principal amount of Notes so exchanged, in each case, plus accrued interest up to but not including the day of
exchange (each, a “UPCB Exchange Loan”), subject to the following procedures and conditions:

(1) the date specified for exchange (the “Exchange Date”) shall be a date to be agreed between the Issuer
and the exchanging holder of Notes, provided that the Issuer’s consent to any Exchange Date requested
by such exchanging holder will not be unreasonably withheld;

(2) on or prior to the Exchange Date, Notes to be exchanged will be delivered to the relevant Paying Agent
or Registrar for cancellation;

(3) the Issuer or the Trustee and/or Security Agent promptly will deliver to the UPCB Facility Agent an
executed Novation Certificate (as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility) designating
such holder (or any Person designated by such Holder) as the New Lender (as defined in the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility) in respect of such UPCB Exchange Loan;

(4) the UPCB Exchange Loan will be denominated in the same currency as the Notes exchanged;

(5) in consideration of the exchange of such Notes for the UPCB Exchange Loan, each of the Issuer, the
holder of Notes and the Trustee and/or Security Agent hereby agrees to assign any right that such
person may be entitled to pursuant to the terms of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility to PreTransfer Accrued Interest (as defined in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility) on such Finco
Loan transferred, and the Issuer will direct the UPCB Facility Agent to pay such Pre-Transfer Accrued
Interest to such holder on the next date on which interest is payable under such Finco Loan; and

(6) the aggregate principal amount of Notes being exchanged on any Exchange Date by a holder is at least
€100,000 (in the case of Euro Notes) or $200,000 (in the case of Dollar Notes).

UPC Broadband Holding has irrevocably consented to the transfer to any holder of Notes each UPCB

Exchange Loan exchanged for Notes pursuant to the terms of this section and each subsequent transfer of such

158


-----

UPCB Exchange Loan, subject to minimum transfer amounts as set forth in the relevant Finco Accession
Agreement and other requirements of a UPCB Lender under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

**_Non Petition_**

Each of the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent and the Registrar and each Noteholder will agree

that its rights against the Issuer under the Indenture and the relevant series of Notes will be limited to the extent
that it will not take any action or proceedings against the Issuer to recover any amounts due and payable by the
Issuer to it under the Indenture, such Notes or the Note Security Documents except as expressly permitted by the
provisions of the Indenture, the relevant series of Notes and the Note Security Documents. Each of the Trustee,
the Security Agent, the Paying Agent and the Registrar and each Noteholder will further agree that it will not,
and in the case of a Noteholder will not request that the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf, petition a
court for, or take any other action or commence any proceedings for, the liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer
or any other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer will have any liability for any

obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

**_To the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or the Finco Accession Agreements_**

In the event that the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent)

(including with respect to any enforcement decision) with respect to any matter, other than the Required Consent
Provisions, arising from time to time under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility or under the Finco
Accession Agreements in which all UPCB Lenders are eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent) (a
“UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Decision”), the Issuer will solicit votes (or other consents) from the
holders of Notes (each, a “Noteholder Consent”) with respect to such UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
Decision in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described above under “—Certain Covenants—
_Minimum Period for Consents under Loan Documents”. Upon the expiration of the applicable consent period, the_
Issuer or the Trustee will inform the UPCB Facility Agent promptly in writing (and in no event more than one
Business Day following such expiration) of the results of the Noteholder Consent.

Under the terms of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, UPCB Lenders are not entitled to split their

votes when voting on a proposed consent, waiver, amendment or other determination. The following voting
mechanic is designed to achieve the same practical effect as allowing a UPCB Lender to split its vote (subject to
the provisions set forth below) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

Under the terms of each Finco Accession Agreement, the UPCB Facility Agent will be authorized to apply

the Noteholder Consent to the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Decision, at the direction of the Issuer or
Trustee, as follows:

(OLC + BC + OBC)
Threshold Amount
OL

Where:

OLC = aggregate Commitments consenting (other than any Commitments of the Issuer and any other SPV

Issuer) to such UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Decision

BC = aggregate principal amount of Notes consenting; provided where at least a majority in aggregate

principal amount of Notes that respond to such solicitation provide consent, BC will be deemed to equal the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding (for purposes of the calculation of BC, the principal amount
of the Notes will be converted into Euro at the Agent’s Spot Rate of Exchange (as defined in the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility) as of the Issue Date)

159


-----

OBC = aggregate principal amount of SPV Notes issued by all SPV Issuers (other than any SPV Notes

issued by the Issuer) consenting; provided, with respect to each SPV Issuer (other than the Issuer), where at least
a majority in aggregate principal of SPV Notes issued by such SPV Issuer that respond to such solicitation
provide consent, OBC with respect to such SPV Issuer will be deemed to equal the aggregate principal amount of
the SPV Notes outstanding and issued by such SPV Issuer

OL = aggregate Commitments under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility

“Commitments” means the aggregate undrawn Additional Facility Commitments (as defined in the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility) and participations in outstanding Advances (as defined in the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

To the extent the Threshold Amount (expressed as a percentage) is greater than or equal to the required

percentage of UPCB Lender consents with respect to any UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Decision, the
entire amount of each Finco Loan will be voted in favor of the matter the subject of such UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility Decision. To the extent the Threshold Amount is less than the required percentage of
UPCB Lender consents with respect to any UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility Decision, the entire amount
of each Finco Loan will be voted against the matter the subject of such UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
Decision.

Except as provided in the next succeeding paragraph, any provision or term of the Finco Accession

Agreements and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility applicable only to the Finco Loans or to a several right
of the Issuer, as UPCB Lender, may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default or
event of default in respect of, or compliance with, any such provision or term may be waived with the consent of the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided,
_however, that any provision or term of a Finco Accession Agreement and the UPC Broadband Holding Bank_
Facility applicable only to Finco Loan AK or Finco Loan AL may be amended or supplemented with the consent of
the holders of at least a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes (and not
the consent of at least a majority in principal amount of all Notes outstanding), as the case may be.

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding

Euro Notes (in respect of the Finco Accession Agreement AK) or the Dollar Notes (in respect of the Finco
Accession Agreement AL) (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, the relevant series of Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver of the
Finco Accession Agreement AK or the Finco Accession Agreement AL, as applicable, may not (with respect to
any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

Loan;

(2) reduce any amounts payable in respect of any prepayment of the relevant Finco Loan;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of the relevant Finco Loan;

(4) make the relevant Finco Loan payable in currency other than that stated in the relevant Finco

offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Security Document, the Deed of Covenant, the Fee Letter and the
UPC Expenses Agreement may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided, however that if any amendment, waiver or
other modification will only affect the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes, only the consent of the holders of at least

160


-----

a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, (and not the consent of at
least a majority of all Notes then outstanding), as the case may be, will be required.

Unless consented to by the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding

Notes (provided, however, that if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect the Euro Notes or
the Dollar Notes, the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Euro Notes or Dollar Notes (and not the consent of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
all Notes then outstanding), as the case may be, shall be required) (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), an amendment,
supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security Document, the Deed of Covenant, the Fee
Letter and the UPC Expenses Agreement may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment waiver or other
determination;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts on any
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to

(6) make any change in these amendment or waiver provisions;

(7) impair the right of any holder of Notes to exchange its Notes for UPCB Exchange Loans in accordance
with “—Events of Default and Remedies—Exchange of Notes for UPCB Loans”; or

(8) to release any Lien on the Collateral except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes
Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the preceding two paragraphs, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer and

the Trustee and/or the Security Agent may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any Notes Security
Document, the Deed of Covenant, the Fee Letter and the UPC Expenses Agreement:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended));

(3) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or that
does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect,
to the extent such change would not violate the provisions of the Indenture;

(4) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or any Notes Security Document to any provision of this
Description of the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended
to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or any Notes Security Document;

(5) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the
Indenture as of the date of the Indenture (including with respect to Collateral);

(6) to the extent necessary to allow the Issuer to participate on the same terms as other UPCB Lenders in
an offer to purchase or otherwise acquire UPCB Loans by any member of the UPCH Group made in
compliance with the requirements set out under “Open Market Purchases of UPCB Loans”;

(7) to release any Lien on the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Notes
Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof; or

(9) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Notes
as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and administration

161


-----

of the Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result
in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and
(ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes.

In determining whether the holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any

direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer or UPC Broadband Holding, or by any Person directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or UPC
Broadband Holding will be considered as though not outstanding.

The Trustee will be entitled to require and rely conclusively on such evidence as is reasonably appropriate in

light of the nature of such amendment or supplement, including an Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s
Certificate in connection with any request of the Issuer to amend the Indenture, the Notes or any Notes Security
Document without the consent of any holder of Notes. In addition, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, and the
Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on, an Officer’s Certificate and/or an Opinion of Counsel, in each
case, reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to such amendment or
supplement have been satisfied.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, the Notes Security Document, the Deed of Covenant, the Fee Letter and the UPC Expenses

Agreement will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, or as to the
Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes (or all Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable) that have been authenticated, except
lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment
money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the
relevant Paying Agent or Registrar for cancellation; or

(b) (i) all Notes (or all Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable) that have not been delivered to the
relevant Paying Agent or Registrar for cancellation (A) have become due and payable by reason of
the mailing or delivery of a notice of redemption or otherwise or (B) will become due and payable
within one year and (ii) the Issuer or a third party acting on behalf of the Issuer has irrevocably
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of
the holders, with respect to the Euro Notes, cash, Cash Equivalents, European Government
Obligations or a combination thereof, in each case, denominated in euro and, with respect to the
Dollar Notes, cash, Cash Equivalents, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in
each case, denominated in U.S. dollars, in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of
any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not
delivered to a Paying Agent or Registrar for cancellation for principal, premium and Additional
Amounts (if any) and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) the Issuer or a third party acting on behalf of the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other amounts
payable by it under the Indenture with respect to the Notes; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes (or all Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable) at
maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be.

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euros (in the case of Euro Notes) and in dollars (in

the case of Dollar Notes) (the “Required Currency”), which is made to or for the account of any holder of the
Notes or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Judgment Currency”), will constitute a
discharge of the Issuer’s obligation under the Indenture and the Notes only to the extent of the amount of the
Required Currency, which such holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, could purchase in the London foreign
exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at
the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment
Currency. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the
Required Currency originally due to such Noteholder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Issuer will
indemnify and hold harmless the Noteholder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or

162


-----

damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity will constitute an obligation separate and
independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder or the Trustee from
time to time and will continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum
in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest

it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to

direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in
the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security
and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. It may not be possible for the Trustee to
take certain actions in relation to the Notes and accordingly in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to
take action, notwithstanding the provision of security or an indemnity to it.

Irish Stock Exchange shall so require, copies of the Indenture, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and the

securities laws. The Issuer will appoint an agent for service of process in New York in any such action or proceeding.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the assets of the Issuer are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States

against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional
Amounts and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable
within the United States.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S under the

U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes representing the Dollar
Notes (the “Dollar Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with The Bank of New York
Mellon as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Regulation S
Global Notes representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the
Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for
the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A

under the U.S. Securities Act, in a private transaction in reliance upon the exemption from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof will initially be represented by one or
more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes” and, together
with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes representing the Dollar Notes
(the “Dollar 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with The Bank of New York Mellon as
custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The 144A Global Notes
representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a
common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Dollar 144A Global Notes and the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein

as the “Dollar Global Notes”. The Euro 144A Global Notes and the Euro Regulation S Global Notes are
collectively referred to herein as the “Euro Global Notes”.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of

interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interest”, and together with the
144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry
Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry
form by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Euro Global
Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and
the Book-Entry Interests in the Dollar Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of $200,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as

applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, “holders” of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the
owners or “holders” of the Notes for any purpose. Only the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the
owner of such Note.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, (or their

respective nominees) will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As
such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own
Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee under the Indenture or any of the Issuer’s respective agents will have any

responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

171


-----

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the relevant Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in

registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes), or Euroclear and/or Clearstream (with respect to the
Euro Global Notes) notify the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository and a
successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to exchange in whole, but not in
part, the Global Note for Definitive Registered Notes;

(3) in whole, but not in part, if the Issuer or DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes), or Euroclear
and/or Clearstream (with respect to the Euro Global Notes) so request following an Event of Default
under the Indenture; or

(4) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or to the Issuer following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the

immediately preceding clause (3), its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or causes to be issued
the relevant Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and

issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or the
Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions”, unless that legend is not
required by the Indenture or applicable law.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrars shall treat the registered holder of any Global

Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office
of the Issuer or the Registrar on its behalf, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer shall not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book
Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as

applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of
the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such
Global Note, subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The redemption price payable in connection with the
redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream,
as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof), subject to any
applicable withholding taxes. The Issuer understands that under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will
credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or
by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of
less than €100,000, in the case of the Euro Global Notes, or $200,000, in the case of the Dollar Global Notes, in
principal amount at maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,

additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to the common depository for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in the case of the
Euro Global Notes) and to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes), which will distribute
such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

172


-----

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global

Notes (i.e., DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee or any of their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by
DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

   - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility

of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name”.

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro

Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (the “Euroclear/Clearstream Holders”) through
Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts
payable in respect of, the Dollar Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes (the “DTC
**Holders”) through DTC in dollars.**

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken

by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will
not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in

immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,
including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge
such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC and in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Indenture and will not be entitled to
Definitive Registered Notes except for as provided in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form of Notes—Issuance of
_Definitive Registered Notes”._

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-Entry Interests

in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions”.

144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Regulation S

Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act. Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Regulation S BookEntry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who
hold interests through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons
shall not be permitted during such periods unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A.
Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A BookEntry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the relevant
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

173


-----

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, Book-Entry Interests may be transferred

and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any Book-Entry Interest
in a Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Note of the same denomination and series will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in
the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly,
will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in such other Global Note for as long as that person retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note

only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes. See “Transfer
_Restrictions”._

This paragraph refers to transfers and exchanges with respect to Dollar Global Notes only. Transfers

involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for 144A Book-Entry Interest in a Dollar Global
Note will be done by DTC by means of an instruction through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal Custodian system.
Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in
the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of
unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after the
date of initial issuance of the Notes. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry interest in such
other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other
procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a BookEntry Interest.

**Information concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and

Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures
solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled
by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers are
responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking

Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a
“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and
provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and
money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade
settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through
electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly
owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company
for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are
registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system
is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance

and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

174


-----

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of

indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global
Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro and U.S. dollars. Book-Entry Interests owned through

DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional
Eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading, Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

Application will be made to the Irish Stock Exchange for the Notes represented by the Global Notes to be

listed on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and to be admitted for trading on the Global Exchange
Market thereof. The Global Notes are expected to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any
permitted secondary market trading activity in the Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds. We expect that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in
immediately available funds. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes,
cross-market transfers between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants,
on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or
Clearstream by the common depository; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of
instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
regulations and within the established deadlines of such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if
the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common depository to take action to
effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes from DTC, and
making and receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable
to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common
depository.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant

purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. Cash received by Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the
settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the
business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream and will

settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate

transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Registrar, the Trustee or any Paying Agent will have
any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or
indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Memorandum to the contrary, for purposes of this “Transfer

_Restrictions” section, any reference to “Notes” or “Note” shall be construed as a reference to “Dollar Notes” or_
“Dollar Note”, respectively.

The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws

and, unless so registered, the Notes may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the U.S. or
to or for the account of any U.S. person, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. The Notes are
being offered and sold and issued (1) in the United States, to “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, and (2) outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons”
as defined in Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities Act in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act.

By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows (terms used in this

paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act are used herein as defined
therein):

(1) You are not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) of the Issuer or UPC

under Rule 144A, in the United States to a person whom you reasonably believe is a qualified
institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; (ii) outside the United
States in a transaction complying with the provisions of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act; or
(iii) to the Issuer, in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws; and (B) you will, and

acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar that
the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(2) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of your
acknowledgments, representations and agreements set forth herein and you agree that, if any of

transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth hereunder.

**European Economic Area**

In relation to each member state of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a

“Relevant Member State”), the Initial Purchasers have represented and agreed that with effect from and
including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the
“Relevant Implementation Date”), it has not made and will not make an offer of the Notes which are the
subject of the offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to the public in that Relevant Member State
other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the
relevant Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

178


-----

(c) any other entity in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,
provided that no such offer of the Notes shall require the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers to publish a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to
Article 16 of the Prospective Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of the Notes to the public” in relation to the

Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase
or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing
the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State, the expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive
2003/71/EC as amended, including by Directive 2010/73/EU and includes any relevant implementing measure in
the Relevant Member State.

**ERISA Considerations**

By acquiring the Notes, or any interest therein, you will be deemed to have further represented, warranted

and agreed, at the time of the acquisition and throughout the period you hold the Notes or any interest therein, as
follows:

(1) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes, or any interest therein, (A) either
(i) you are not, and are not acting on behalf of (and for so long as you hold such Notes or any interest
therein will not be, and will not be acting on behalf of), (I) an employee benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)),
that is subject to the provisions of part 4 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (II) an individual retirement
account or other plan or arrangement to which Section 4975 of the Code, applies, or (III) any entity
whose underlying assets include “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3–101
(as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA)) by reason of any such plan’s investment in such entity (each
of (I), (II) and (III), a “Benefit Plan Investor”) or (IV) a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which
is subject to any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar
to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of
Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”), and no part of the assets to be used by you to acquire or
hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any Benefit Plan Investor or any such
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, or (ii) your acquisition, holding and disposition of such Note,
or any interest therein does not and will not constitute or otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (or, in the case of a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, a non-exempt violation of any Similar Laws); and (B) neither
the Issuer nor any of its affiliates is a “Fiduciary” (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or, with respect to a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any definition of
“fiduciary” under Similar Laws) with respect to you, as the purchaser or holder, in connection with
your purchase or holding of the Notes, or as a result of any exercise by the Issuer or any of its affiliates
of any rights in connection with the Notes, and no advice provided by the Issuer or any of its affiliates
has formed a primary basis for any investment decision by or on behalf of you, as the purchaser or
holder, in connection with the Notes and the transactions contemplated with respect to the Notes.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Cayman Islands Taxation**

The following is a discussion of certain Cayman Islands tax consequences of an investment in the Notes.

The discussion is a general summary of present law, which is subject to prospective and retroactive change. It is
not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s particular circumstances, and does not consider tax
consequences other than those arising under Cayman Islands law.

Under existing Cayman Islands laws:

   - Payments of interest and principal on the Notes will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands
and no withholding will be required on the payment of interest and principal to any holder of the Notes,
nor will gains derived from the disposal of the Notes be subject to Cayman Islands income or
corporation tax. The Cayman Islands currently have no income, corporation or capital gains tax and no
estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax.

   - No stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of the Notes. Ad valorem stamp duty will be payable,
however, within 45 days of an executed, completed and delivered original of the Notes being brought
into the Cayman Islands, for example, for enforcement. An instrument of transfer in respect of a Note
is stampable if executed in or brought into the Cayman Islands.

**The Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision)—Undertaking as to Tax Concessions**

The Issuer has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with

limited liability and, as such, has applied for and obtained an undertaking as to tax concessions from the
Governor in Cabinet of the Cayman Islands substantially in the following form:

In accordance with Section 6 of The Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) the Governor in Cabinet

undertakes with the Issuer:

(a) that no law which is hereafter enacted in the Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income,
gains or appreciations shall apply to the Issuer or its operations; and

(b) in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature
of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable

(i) on or in respect of the shares debentures or other obligations of the Issuer; or

(ii) by way of the withholding in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in Section 6(3) of

the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision).

These concessions shall be for a period of TWENTY years from the 8[th] day of February 2011.

**EU Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income**

Under the Council Directive 2003/48/EC (the “EU Savings Tax Directive”) each Member State of the EU (a

“Member State”) is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of interest
payments or other similar income paid by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an
individual resident in that other Member State. However, Austria may instead apply a withholding system for a
transitional period in relation to such payments, deducting tax at a current rate of 35%. The transitional period is
to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to the
exchange of information relating to such payments.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the EU adopted a Council Directive amending and broadening the scope

of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these new requirements from
January 1, 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the EU Savings Tax Directive, in
particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The directive will also expand the
circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member State must be
reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities or legal arrangements
(including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases apply where the person, entity or
arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the EU.

180


-----

A number of non-EU countries and certain dependent or associated territories of certain Member States have

adopted similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments
made by a person within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in a Member
State. In addition, the Member States have entered into reciprocal provision of information or transitional
withholding arrangements with certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made
by a person in a Member State to, or collected by such a person for, an individual resident in one of those
territories.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition,

ownership, and disposition of the Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below). This description only applies to
Notes held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and does not address, except as set forth
below, aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax
rules, such as:

   - banks or other financial institutions;

   - insurance companies;

   - real estate investment trusts, individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts;

   - regulated investment companies;

   - grantor trusts;

   - tax-exempt organizations;

   - persons that will own the Notes through partnerships or other pass-through entities;

   - dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

   - U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;

   - certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United States;

   - U.S. Holders that use a mark-to-market method of accounting; or

   - U.S. Holders that will hold a Note as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion
or integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Moreover, this description does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or alternative minimum tax

consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes and does not address the 3.8% Medicare
tax on net investment income that can also apply to certain U.S. holders’ capital gains and interest in respect of
the Notes. This description also does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not
acquire the Notes as part of the initial distribution at their initial issue price (generally, the first price to the public
at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money). Each prospective purchaser should consult its own
tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and
disposing of the Notes.

This description is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) (“Code”), U.S. Treasury

Regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), administrative pronouncements and judicial
decisions, each as available and in effect on the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change or
differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect), which could affect the tax considerations described
herein. No opinion of counsel or ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be given with
respect to any of the considerations discussed herein. No assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert,
or that a court would not sustain, a position different from any of the tax considerations discussed below.

For purposes of this description, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes who for U.S. federal

income tax purposes is:

   - a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, including the District of
Columbia;

181


-----

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust (1) that validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
(2)(a) the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the
substantial decisions of which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the

tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to
its consequences.

The discussion below assumes that the Notes are treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax

purposes, except as otherwise described.

Persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of Notes should consult their own tax advisors

concerning the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to their particular situations as well as any
considerations arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

**_Characterization of the Issuer_**

The Issuer will file IRS Form 8832, electing to be treated as an entity disregarded from its sole owner for

U.S. federal income tax purposes, to be effective on or prior to the issuance of the Notes.

**_Redemptions and Additional Amounts_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Redemption and Repurchase”, “Description of the

_Notes—Withholding Taxes”, and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Payments for Consent”), the_
Issuer may be obligated to make payments in excess of stated interest and the adjusted issue price of the Notes
(“Additional Amounts”) or redeem the Notes in advance of their expected maturity. The Issuer believes that the
Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of the possibility of such payments
or redemptions. This position is based in part on assumptions regarding the likelihood, as of the date of issuance
of the Notes, of such payments or redemptions. Assuming such position is respected, any amounts paid to a U.S.
Holder pursuant to such redemption would be taxable as described below in “—Sale, Exchange, Retirement or
_Taxable Disposition” and any payments of Additional Amounts should be taxable as additional ordinary income_
when received or accrued, in accordance with such holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The IRS, however, may take a position contrary to the position described above, which could affect the
amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Notes. A U.S. Holder that desires to
take the position that the Notes are subject to the contingent payment debt instrument rules should consult with
its tax advisor, including regarding the manner in which to disclose such position as required by applicable U.S.
Treasury Regulations; the IRS may disagree with such holder’s contrary position. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules
and the consequences thereof. This discussion assumes that the Notes are not treated as contingent payment debt
instruments.

**_Payments and Accruals of Stated Interest_**

Stated interest paid on the Notes generally will be treated as “qualified stated interest.” Payments of

qualified stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and
without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest
income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated
interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is
treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate.

In the case of the Euro Notes, stated interest paid in euros will be included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income

in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euros, including the amount of any withholding tax thereon,
regardless of whether the euros are converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash
method of tax accounting will determine such U.S. dollar value using the spot rate of exchange on the date of
receipt. A cash method U.S. Holder generally will not realize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of the
interest payment but may have foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros

182


-----

received. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will determine the U.S. dollar
value of accrued interest income using the average rate of exchange for the accrual period (or, with respect to an
accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year).
Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest
income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the
accrual period within each taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period) or the spot rate on the date of
receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. Holder that uses the
accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an
interest payment if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate used in
translating the accrual of that interest. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss to be recognized by such U.S.
Holder will be an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment
(determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual
period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined
above) regardless of whether the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss will be
ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Foreign
currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source provided that the residence of a taxpayer is considered to be
the United States for purposes of the rules regarding foreign currency gain or loss.

Interest including original issue discount (“OID”), if any, included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with

respect to the Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation
on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific
“baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income”, or in the
case of certain U.S. Holders, “general category income”. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at
the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

A Note may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An obligation generally is

treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if its “stated redemption price at
maturity” exceeds its issue price by at least the “OID de minimis amount”. The OID de minimis amount equals 1/
4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years
from its issue date to its maturity. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note is the sum of all payments
required to be made on the Note other than qualified stated interest payments.

If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income before the

receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. The
amount of OID a U.S. Holder should include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID for the Note
for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the Note is held by such U.S.
Holder. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the accrual
period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the
Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or
interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of
OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the difference between (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price”
of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed generally on a constant
yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular
accrual period) and (2) the amount of any qualified stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted
issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the
amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments received on the Note that were not
qualified stated interest.

Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of

OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount
payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the adjusted issue price at the
beginning of the final accrual period. Under the Treasury Regulations, a holder of a Note with OID may elect to
include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method. Once made with
respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an
election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor.

183


-----

U.S. Holders may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and

yield to maturity by contacting the Treasurer, UPC Holding B.V., Boeing Avenue 53, Schiphol-Rijk, 1119 PE,
The Netherlands, +31 (0)20 778 2964.

Any OID on a Euro Note generally will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated

into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. Upon receipt of
an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a sale or disposition of such a Note or otherwise), a
U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in the same manner
as stated interest received by an accrual basis holder, as described above. Holders are urged to consult their own
tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or
loss rules. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payments of stated interest payable
on the Note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered
made for the earlier accrual periods first; and, third, as receipts of principal.

The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding

the application of these rules to their particular situations.

**_Possible Effects of the UPC Exchange Transaction_**

In connection with the UPC Exchange Transaction, holders that elect to participate in the exchange will

receive UPC Qualified Notes with a new issuer. This change may be viewed as giving rise to a significant
modification of the Notes, though there may be arguments to the contrary. If the change in issuer is treated as a
significant modification, U.S. Holders will recognize gain or loss as described under “Sale, Exchange,
Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition.” The amount deemed to be realized in such a taxable exchange would
be the issue price of the UPC Qualified Notes, which would be the fair market value of the UPC Qualified Notes
as of the date of the deemed exchange if, as seems likely, the UPC Qualified Notes are treated as publicly traded
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, a U.S. Holder could be treated as acquiring the UPC Qualified
Notes with OID. This would occur if the issue price of the UPC Qualified Notes as of the date of the deemed
exchange (based on the fair market value of the UPC Qualified Notes if the UPC Qualified Notes are treated as
publicly traded for U.S. federal income tax purposes) was less than the stated principal amount of the UPC
Qualified Notes by at least the OID de minimis amount (as described above). If the UPC Qualified Notes are
issued with OID, a U.S. Holder may be required to include such excess in income as OID, as it accrues, in
accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of interest before the receipt of cash payments
attributable to this income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Except as noted above in this paragraph, the
U.S. federal income tax considerations related to owning a UPC Qualified Note should generally be the same as
the U.S. federal income tax considerations related to owning a Note.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition_**

A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable

disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition (other than any amount received in respect of accrued and unpaid interest
which will be subject to tax in the manner described above in “—Payments and Accruals of Stated Interest” to
the extent not previously included in income), and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost increased by the amount of

any OID previously included in income and decreased by payments other than stated interest made with respect
to the Note. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Euro Note with euros, the U.S. dollar cost of the Euro Note generally
will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange
on that date. The amount realized upon the disposition of a Euro Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of
the amount received on the date of the disposition calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However,
if the Euro Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so elects, an
accrual basis U.S. Holder) should determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of or amount received on the Euro
Note, as applicable, by translating the amount paid or received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date
of the purchase or disposition, as applicable. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in respect of the
purchase and disposition of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to
all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below in the case of a Euro Note, any gain or loss recognized

on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss, and will be

184


-----

long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year. Long-term capital gain of a noncorporate U.S. Holder generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital losses
against ordinary income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note generally will be treated as gain or loss from sources within the United States.

In the case of a Euro Note, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or

other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain
or loss is attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. Holder
held such Note. Such foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of
the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase
price for the Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase of the Note. If the Note is traded
on an established securities market, with respect to a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis
U.S. Holder), such foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (x) the U.S. dollar value of the
U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of
the disposition and (y) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note calculated at
the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase of the Note. The realization of any foreign
currency gain or loss, including foreign currency gain or loss with respect to amounts attributable to accrued and
unpaid stated interest and any OID, will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the
disposition of the Notes.

**_Exchange of Amounts in Other than U.S. Dollars_**

If a U.S. Holder receives euros as interest on a Euro Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement or other

taxable disposition of a Euro Note, such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the euros will equal the U.S. dollar value
when the euros are received. If a U.S. Holder purchased a Euro Note with previously owned non-U.S. currency,
gain or loss on such currency will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S.
Holder’s tax basis in such currency and the spot rate on the date of purchase of the Euro Note. Any such gain or
loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss from sources within the United States provided that the
residence of the U.S. Holder is considered to be the United States for purposes of the rule governing foreign
currency transactions.

**_Reportable Transaction Reporting_**

Under certain U.S. Treasury Regulations, U.S. Holders that participate in “reportable transactions” (as

defined in the regulations) must attach to their U.S. federal income tax returns a disclosure statement on IRS
Form 8886. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss
from the Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the regulations. U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible obligation to file IRS Form 8886 with respect to
the ownership or disposition of the Notes, or any related transaction, including without limitation, the disposition
of any non-U.S. currency received as interest or as proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Notes.

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue “Additional Notes” (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Principal, Maturity

_and Interest”). These Additional Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as_
the original Notes, in some cases may not be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the original
Notes.

**_Alternative Characterization of the Notes_**

The proper characterization of instruments such as the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes is

uncertain. It is possible that the Notes may not be treated as indebtedness of the Issuer, but even if an alternative
characterization were to apply, a U.S. Holder should, in general, be taxed in a manner similar to that described
above with respect to such holder’s share of interest and any disposition of the Notes. U.S. Holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors in this regard.

185


-----

**_U.S. Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting_**

Backup withholding and information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments of principal of,

and interest and accruals of OID, if any, on, an obligation and to proceeds of the sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of an obligation, to certain U.S. Holders. The payor will be required to withhold backup
withholding tax on payments made within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman or certain of
their affiliates, on a Note to, or from gross proceeds of the sale or disposition of a Note paid to, a U.S. Holder if
the U.S. Holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or
establish an exemption from, the backup withholding requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited

against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld
under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any
required information in a timely manner.

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain

exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in custodial accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions). U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this
requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_FATCA_**

Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued thereunder (“FATCA”)

generally may impose withholding at a rate of 30% on payments made to any foreign entity on debt obligations
generating U.S. source interest or certain other debt obligations generating non-U.S. source interest issued by a
foreign financial institution that (i) enters into certain agreements with the IRS or (ii) becomes subject to
provisions of local law intended to implement an intergovernmental agreement entered into pursuant to FATCA,
in each case to the extent such payments are attributable to U.S. source income, unless the foreign entity
receiving such payments complies with various U.S. information reporting and/or due diligence requirements
(generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts with such foreign entity) or otherwise
qualifies for an exemption. Withholding on payments on debt obligations issued by foreign financial institutions,
including on debt obligations generating non-U.S. source interest, will not occur before 2017. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, even if payments on the Notes are treated as or are paid from a foreign financial institution,
including in the event the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, and such payments are treated as
“foreign passthru payments,” the Notes will be grandfathered because no final regulations defining a “foreign
passthru payment” have been issued and therefore are not subject to the FATCA rules (including the withholding
rules) described above. If, however, the Notes are modified at a time when the grandfathering rules are no longer
available (i.e., more than six months after the date final regulations define a “foreign passthru payment”),
withholding can apply and holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will not be entitled to receive any
additional amounts to compensate them for such withholding. In addition, if Additional Notes are issued after the
expiration of the grandfathering period, have the same CUSIP or ISIN as the Notes issued hereby, and are subject
to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all notes, including the Notes issued hereby, as
subject to withholding under FATCA. The intergovernmental agreement between the Cayman Islands and the
United States (see below) modifies the requirements in this paragraph and an intergovernmental agreement
between the United States and a foreign country where a holder or intermediary is located may further modify
such requirements. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this
legislation on their investment in the Notes.

**The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating**

**to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should**
**consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations.**

**Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority Law**

The Cayman Islands have entered into a Model 1 intergovernmental agreement (the “US IGA”) with the

United States and have entered into a similar intergovernmental agreement (the “UK IGA”) with the United
Kingdom (together with the US IGA, the “IGAs”). The Issuer will be required to comply with the Cayman
Islands Tax Information Authority Law (2014 Revision)(as amended) together with regulations and guidance
notes made pursuant to such Law that give effect to the IGAs. To the extent the Issuer is classified as a Cayman
Islands Financial Institution and cannot be treated as a Non-Reporting Cayman Islands Financial Institution (as

186


-----

defined in the IGAs) by taking advantage of one of the categories set out in Annex II to the IGAs (for example by
being a Sponsored Investment Entity (as defined in the IGAs)), the Issuer will be a “Reporting Cayman Islands
Financial Institution” (as defined in the IGAs). Although the FATCA classification of the Issuer is not entirely
clear, the Issuer has registered with the IRS and obtained a Global Intermediary Identification Number (for the
purposes of the US IGA only) and intends to report to the Cayman Islands Tax Information Authority any
payments made to (i) Specified US Persons with respect to US Reportable Accounts and (ii) Specified UK
Persons with respect to UK Reportable Accounts (each such term as defined in the relevant IGA). The Cayman
Islands Tax Information Authority will exchange such information with the IRS or HMRC as the case may be
under the terms of the relevant IGA. Under the terms of the US IGA, withholding will not be imposed on
payments made to the Issuer unless the IRS has specifically listed the Issuer as a non-participating financial
institution, or on payments made by the Issuer to the holders of Notes unless the Issuer has otherwise assumed
responsibility for withholding under United States tax law.

**CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS**

Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Memorandum to the contrary, for purposes of this “Certain

_Employee Benefit Plan Considerations” section, any reference to “Notes” or “Note” shall be construed as a_
reference to “Dollar Notes” or “Dollar Note”, respectively.

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain

fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, including, without limitation, entities such as collective investment
funds, certain insurance company separate accounts, certain insurance company general accounts, and entities
whose underlying assets are treated as being subject to ERISA (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those
persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Any person who exercises any discretionary authority
or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is
generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan under ERISA. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject
to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification
and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the
ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws (as defined below).

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an

ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain
persons who are “parties in interest” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”,
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages
in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and
the transaction may have to be rescinded.

Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise

if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the
Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Even if none of the
Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee is a party in interest or a disqualified person, a prohibited transaction
may arise if the fiduciary authorizing the investment has an interest in or affiliation with any of the foregoing
parties that may affect his, her or its judgment as a fiduciary. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction
provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part
on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such
decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”)
91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14, as amended (relating to
transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to
investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance
company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23, as amended (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset
managers), (collectively, the “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be
available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a party in interest that is a
service provider to a Plan investing in the Notes for adequate consideration, provided such service provider is not
(i) the fiduciary with respect to the Plan’s assets used to acquire the Notes or an affiliate of such fiduciary or
(ii) an affiliate of the employer sponsoring the Plan (the “Service Provider Exemption”). Adequate
consideration means fair market as determined in good faith by the Plan fiduciary pursuant to regulations to be
promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor. However, there can be no assurance that any of these InvestorBased Exemptions or the Service Provider Exemption or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be
available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes.

“Governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in

Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in
Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions
of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal, state, local,
non-U.S. or other laws or regulations (such as the prohibited transaction rules of Section 503 of the Code) that
are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”).

The purchase of the Notes using the assets of a Plan might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited

transaction rules of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be

188


-----

available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be purchased using the assets of any Plan if the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee or their respective affiliates is the sponsor of, or Fiduciary to, such Plan in the absence of
an applicable exemption.

EACH ACQUIRER AND EACH TRANSFEREE OF A NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN WILL BE

DEEMED TO REPRESENT, WARRANT AND AGREE THAT AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION AND
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THAT IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN THAT
(1) EITHER (A) IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF (AND FOR SO LONG AS IT HOLDS
THIS NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN IT WILL NOT BE, AND WILL NOT BE ACTING ON BEHALF
OF) (I) AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF ERISA, THAT IS SUBJECT
TO THE PROVISIONS OF PART 4 OF SUBTITLE B OF TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) AN INDIVIDUAL
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT OR OTHER PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH SECTION 4975 OF THE
CODE APPLIES, OR (III) AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE “PLAN ASSETS”
(WITHIN THE MEANING OF 29 C.F.R. SECTION 2510.3-101 (AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 3(42) OF
ERISA)) BY REASON OF ANY SUCH PLAN’S INVESTMENT IN SUCH ENTITY (EACH OF (I), (II) AND
(III), A “BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR”) OR (IV) A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN
WHICH IS SUBJECT TO ANY SIMILAR LAWS, AND NO PART OF THE ASSETS TO BE USED BY IT TO
ACQUIRE OR HOLD SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN CONSTITUTES THE ASSETS OF ANY
BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR OR ANY SUCH GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, OR
(B) ITS ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND DISPOSITION OF SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN
DOES NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR OTHERWISE RESULT IN A NON-EXEMPT

PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA AND/OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE
(OR, IN THE CASE OF A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH, OR NON-U.S. PLAN, A NON-EXEMPT
VIOLATION OF ANY SIMILAR LAWS); AND (2) NEITHER THE ISSUER NOR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES IS A “FIDUCIARY” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 3(21) OF ERISA OR SECTION
4975 OF THE CODE OR, WITH RESPECT TO A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, ANY
DEFINITION OF “FIDUCIARY” UNDER SIMILAR LAWS) WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRER OR
TRANSFEREE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PURCHASE OR HOLDING OF THE NOTE, OR AS A
RESULT OF ANY EXERCISE BY THE ISSUER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OF ANY RIGHTS IN
CONNECTION WITH THE NOTE, AND NO ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE ISSUER OR ANY OF ITS
AFFILIATES HAS FORMED A PRIMARY BASIS FOR ANY INVESTMENT DECISION BY OR ON
BEHALF OF THE ACQUIRER OR TRANSFEREE IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTE AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTE.

THE ISSUER, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AND THE TRUSTEE, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE

AFFILIATES, SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONCLUSIVELY RELY UPON THE TRUTH AND ACCURACY
OF THE FOREGOING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS BY ACQUIRERS AND
TRANSFEREES OF ANY NOTES WITHOUT FURTHER INQUIRY.

The transfer of any Note or any interest therein to a Plan or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is

subject to any Similar Laws is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or
any of their respective affiliates, that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to
investments by such plans generally or any particular such plan; that the Investor-Based Exemptions or the
Service Provider Exemption described above, or any other prohibited transaction exemption, would apply to such
an investment by such plans in general or any particular such plan; or that such an investment is appropriate for
such plans generally or any particular such plan.

The discussion of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code contained in this Offering Memorandum, is, of

necessity, general, and does not purport to be complete. Moreover, the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of
the Code are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. Therefore,
the matters discussed above may be affected by future regulations, rulings and court decisions, some of which
may have retroactive application and effect.

Any Plan or employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and any fiduciary

thereof, proposing to participate in the offers and acquire the Notes or any interest therein should consult with its
legal advisors regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws, to such investment, and to confirm that such investment
will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of any applicable
requirement of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Notwithstanding anything in this Offering Memorandum to the contrary, for purposes of this “Plan of

_Distribution” section, (i) any reference to “Notes” or “Note” shall be construed as a reference to “Dollar Notes”_
or “Dollar Note”, respectively and (i) any reference to “Initial Purchasers” or “Initial Purchaser” shall be
construed as a reference to “Dollar Initial Purchasers” or “Dollar Initial Purchaser”, respectively.

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase

from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The sale will be made pursuant to a purchase agreement
dated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum (the “purchase agreement”).

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to

purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the
Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly,
to purchase from the Issuer, together with all other Initial Purchasers, Dollar Notes in an aggregate principal
amount of $800 million.

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer each of the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on

the cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering
price and any other selling terms. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their
affiliates.

In the purchase agreement, the Issuer, UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding have agreed that:

    - subject to certain exceptions, including but not limited to (i) one or more additional facilities or debt
securities, the proceeds of which are used to fund one or more additional facilities, under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility, (ii) the issuance of any debt securities by UPC Holding or (iii) any
issuance of Additional Notes (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuer, UPC Holding and UPC
Broadband Holding will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or
indirectly, or file with the Securities Exchange Commission a registration statement under the U.S.
Securities Act relating to any debt securities, which are substantially similar to the Notes offered
hereby, issued by the Issuer, having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue of the
Notes, without the prior consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC with respect to the Dollar Notes and
J.P. Morgan Securities plc with respect to the Euro Notes, for a period of 30 days after the Time of Sale
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement); and

    - the Issuer, UPC Holding and UPC Broadband Holding will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC, and therefore may not make

sales of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and
regulations. To the extent that any such Initial Purchaser intends to effect sales of the Notes in the United States,
it will do so only through one or more affiliated U.S. registered broker dealers, or otherwise as permitted by
applicable U.S. law.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_United States_**

Each purchaser of Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will be deemed to

have made the acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under “Transfer Restrictions”.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act and may not be offered or

sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except to qualified institutional
buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and to non U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale
or transfer of the Notes, see “Transfer Restrictions”.

The Notes may not be offered to the public within any jurisdiction. By accepting delivery of this Offering

Memorandum, you agree not to offer, sell, resell, transfer or deliver, directly or indirectly, any Note to the public.

**_United Kingdom_**

In the purchase agreement, each Initial Purchaser has also represented and agreed that:

(i) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

190


-----

section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to such Initial Purchaser.

Each Initial Purchaser has also agreed in the purchase agreement that it has complied with all applicable

securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers Notes or
possesses or distributes this Offering Memorandum, and will, subject to certain provisions in the purchase

**_European Economic Area_**

In relation to each member state of the EEA which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a

“Relevant Member State”), each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that with effect from and including
the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the “Relevant
Implementation Date”), it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes which are the subject of the offering
contemplated by this Offering Memorandum to the public in that Relevant Member State other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus
Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to obtaining the prior consent of the
relevant Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers nominated by the Issuer for any such offer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive,

provided that no such offer of Notes shall require the Issuer or any Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus

pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the
Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes

in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information
on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe
the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any measure implementing the
Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State, the expression “Prospectus Directive” means Directive
2003/71/EC as amended including by Directive 2010/73/EU and includes any relevant implementing measure in
the Relevant Member State and the expression “2010 PD Amending Directive” means Directive 2010/73/EU.

**_The Netherlands_**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Notes (including rights representing an interest in

each global note that represents the Notes) may only be offered or sold to qualified investors (gekwalificeerde
_beleggers) as defined in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht)._

**_Cayman Islands_**

No invitation whether directly or indirectly may be made to the public in the Cayman Islands to subscribe

for the Notes unless the Issuer is listed on the Cayman Islands Stock Exchange. The Issuer does not intend to be
so listed.

**General**

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In

addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions”. The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange and for the_

191


-----

admission for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer and
UPC Holding that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial
Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such
market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange
Act. Accordingly, the Issuer and UPC Holding cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the
Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell
will be favorable.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes

and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date

specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used
for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree
otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the
sixth business day will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisors.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Managers may engage in overallotment,

stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes
in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order
to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the
Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Managers
engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various

activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform,
various consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending and capital markets services for
UPC Holding and Liberty Global, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain
of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to subsidiaries of Liberty
Global or UPC Holding in the past. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending
relationship with, and/or own outstanding debt securities of, UPC Holding and/or its affiliates have hedged, and
are likely to hedge in the future, their credit exposure to UPC Holding and/or its affiliates consistent with their
risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by
entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates
provide UPC Holding and/or its affiliates, from time to time, with hedging services, and may act as
counterparties to certain hedging agreements entered into by UPC Holding and/or its affiliates and such parties
will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates

may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer.
The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under facilities of the UPC

Broadband Holding Bank Facility certain of which will be repaid with the proceeds from the offering of the
Notes and are parties to certain hedging arrangements with UPC Holding and/or its subsidiaries. See “Use of
_Proceeds”. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are party to certain hedging_
arrangements and may be counterparties to certain cross-currency swap contracts that we may enter into with
respect to the Dollar Notes.

**ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Most of the Issuer’s directors and officers

live outside the United States. Most of the assets of the Issuer’s directors and officers and all of the Issuer’s
assets are located outside the United States. As a result, although the Issuer has appointed an agent for service of
process under the Indenture, it may be difficult for you to serve process on those persons or on the Issuer in the
United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them or the Issuer based on civil liability
provisions of the securities laws of the United States. The Issuer will appoint Law Debenture Corporate Services
Inc. as its agent in New York for service of process.

The United States and the Cayman Islands do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal

recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Although there is no statutory
enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in New York or other states in the United States, a
judgment obtained in such jurisdictions will be recognized and enforced in the courts of the Cayman Islands at
common law, without any re-examination of the merits of the underlying dispute, by an action commenced on the
foreign judgment debt in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, provided such judgment (i) is given by a
foreign court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) imposes on the judgment debtor a liability to pay a liquidated sum for
which the judgment has been given, (iii) is final, (iv) is not in respect of taxes, a fine or a penalty and (v) was not
obtained in a manner and is not of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice or the public
policy of the Cayman Islands. A Cayman Islands court may also stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are
being brought elsewhere.

commits any breach of its obligations under the Administration Agreement and (i) such breach is not capable of
remedy; or (ii) such party fails, where such breach is capable of remedy, within thirty days of receipt of notice
served by the other party requiring it so to do, to remedy such breach; or (c) at any time by giving notice in writing
to the other party (with a copy to any applicable rating agencies at any time within twelve months of the date of

**GLOSSARY**

**Term** **Definition**

“ADSL” An asymmetric digital subscriber line is a system for high-speed data transmission over
existing telephone cables. The telephone cable is effectively divided into three bands: the
downstream band from the service provider to the end customer; the upstream band from the
end customer to the service provider; and a voice band through which (using a splitter)
telephone calls (analog or via ISDN) can be made.

“Analog” Comes from the word “analogous” which means “similar to” in telephone transmission, the
signal being transmitted (voice, video or image) is “analogous” to the original signal.

“Backbone” A backbone refers to the principal data routes, between large, interconnected networks or
within a large operator’s network.

“bandwidth” The width of a communications channel; in other words, the difference between the highest
and lowest frequencies available for network signals. Bandwidth also refers to the capacity
to move information.

“broadband” Any circuit that can transfer data significantly faster than a dial up phone line.


“Bundle/

bundling”


Bundling is a marketing strategy that involves offering several products for sale as one
combined product.


“Digital” The use of a binary code to represent information in telecommunications recording and
computing. Analog signals, such as voice or music, are encoded digitally by sampling the
voice or music analog signals many times a second and assigning a number to each sample.
Recording or transmitting information digitally has two major benefits: First, digital signals
can be reproduced more precisely so digital transmission is “cleaner” than analog
transmission and the electronic circuitry necessary to handle digital is becoming cheaper and
more powerful; and second, digital signals require less transmission capacity than analog
signals.

“DSL” Ditigal Subscriber Line is a generic name for a range of digital technologies relating to the
transmission of internet and data signals from the telecommunications service provider’s
central office to the end customer’s premises over the standard copper wire used for voice
services.

“DTH” Direct-to-home, which refers to satellite television broadcasts intended for home reception.

“DTT” Digital terrestrial television.

“DVR” Digital video recorder is a device that allows end users to digitally record television
programming for later playback.

“EuroDOCSIS” Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) is an international standard that
defines the communications and operation support interface requirements for a data over
cable system. It permits the addition of high-speed data transfer to an existing cable TV
system. Cable companies use the EuroDOCSIS standard to improve speeds they can offer.
The EuroDOCSIS 3.0 broadband technology allows speed levels of 200 Mbps and beyond.

“Free-to-air” Transmission of content for which television viewers are not required to pay a fee for
receiving transmissions.

“FTTx” Fiber to the x; FTTx is a generic term for any broadband network architecture that uses
optical fiber to replace all or part of the usual metal local loop used for last mile
telecommunications. The generic term originated as a generalization of several

configurations of fiber deployment (FTTN, FTTC, FTTB, FTTH...), all starting by FTT but
differentiated by the last letter, which is substituted by an x in the generalization.

G-1

**Term** **Definition**

“Internet” A collection of interconnected networks spanning the entire world, including university,
corporate, government and research networks. These networks all use the IP (Internet
Protocol) communications protocol.

“IP” Internet Protocol is a protocol used for communicating data across a packet-switched
network. It is used for transmitting data over the internet and other similar networks. The data
is broken down into data packets, each data packet is assigned an individual address, then the
data packets are transmitted independently and finally reassembled at the destination.

“IPTV” Internet Protocol Television is the transmission of television content using IP over a network
infrastructure, such as a broadband connection.


“Local loop

infrastructure”


The local loop is the physical link between the first demarcation point of the customer’s
premises and the delivery point into the network of the provider renting the local loop. The
local loop is referred to as the “last mile”.


“Mbps” Megabits per second; a unit of data transfer rate equal to 1,000,000 bits per second. The
bandwidths of broadband networks are often indicated in Mb/s.

“MHz” Megahertz (or one million hertz) is the basic measure of frequency and represents one million
cycles per second.

“network” An interconnected collection of components which would, in a telecommunications network,
consist of switches connected to each other and to customer equipment by real or virtual links.
Transmission links may be based on fiber optic or metallic cable or point to point radio
connections.


“Over-the-top

(OTT)”


Over-the-top video content providers, which deliver television signals as a video stream on
top of third parties’ broadband internet access services.


“RGU” Revenue Generating Unit.

“Triple Play” Offering of digital television, broadband internet and telephony services packaged in a
bundle.


“Unbundled

local loop”


The twisted-pair connection between the local exchange and the home.


“VDSL” Very high bit rate DSL, a DSL technology that provides a faster data transfer rate than
asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and ADSL2+ technologies. In most occasions
VDSL2 technology is used, which extends the capacity of the underlying VDSL system by
further utilizing the frequency spectrum and extending transfer speeds for the downstream
band to up to 50 Mbps.

“Vectoring” Also known as VDSL2 vectoring, a transmission method that employs the coordination of
line signals for reduction of crosstalk levels and improvement of performance, extending
transfer speeds for the downstream band to up to 100 Mbps.

“VoD” Video on demand; a service which provides subscribers with enhanced playback functionality
and gives subscribers access to a broad array of on demand programming, including movies,
live events, local drama, music videos, kids programming and adult programming.

“VoIP” Voice over Internet Protocol; a telephone service via internet, or via TCP/IP protocol, which
can be accessed using a computer, a sound card, adequate software and a modem.

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

The Board of Directors
UPCB Finance IV Limited:

**Report on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of UPCB Finance IV Limited, which
comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related notes to the financial statements
including the notes on the statement of operations and statement of cash flows.

**_Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditors’ Responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects,
the financial position of UPCB Finance IV Limited as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

**UPCB Finance IV Limited**

**Notes to Financial Statements**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

**(1)** **Basis of Presentation**

UPCB Finance IV Limited (the Company or UPCB Finance IV) was incorporated on February 1, 2011

under the laws of the Cayman Islands. The Company is a special purpose entity which engages in limited
activities, and is managed by its directors.

As permitted by its articles of incorporation, the business of the Company is the granting of loans or other

forms of financing directly or indirectly in whatever means to UPC Financing Partnership Limited (UPC
Financing), a subsidiary of UPC Holding B.V. (UPC Holding). This includes, but is not limited to, subscription
of bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, advances, the granting of pledges or the issuing of other guarantees
of any kind to secure the obligations of UPC Holding.

The Company may finance itself in whatever form including, without being limited to, through borrowing or

through issuance of listed or unlisted notes and other debt instruments (e.g. including but not limited to bonds,
notes, loan participation notes and subordinated notes) including under stand-alone issues, medium term note and
commercial paper programs.

In general, the Company may undertake any financial, commercial, industrial or real estate transactions

which it may deem useful in accomplishment and development of its business and, in such context, it may give
or receive guarantees, issue all types of securities and financial instruments and enter into any type of hedging,
trading, or derivative transactions.

These financial statements reflect our evaluation of the accounting treatment and disclosures of subsequent

events through March 19, 2015, the date the financial statements were issued.

**(2)** **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Estimates_**

The preparation of the financial statements, in accordance with generally accepted principles in the United

States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Functional Currency_**

The reporting currency of our Company is the United States dollar.

**_Cash_**

Cash and cash equivalents are stated in the balance sheet at nominal value, and consist of demand deposits

with banks or other financial institutions.

**_Statement of Operations_**

These financial statements do not include a statement of operations because the Company has not (i) earned

any revenue or income, or (ii) incurred any expenses through December 31, 2014. In this regard, general and
administrative costs associated with the formation and administration of the Company are the responsibility of
Liberty Global B.V., a subsidiary of Liberty Global plc, and, as such, are not presented in these financial
statements.

**_Statement of Cash Flows_**

These financial statements do not include a statement of cash flows because the Company has no cash flows

for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

**(3)** **Shareholder’s Equity**

The Company has authorized share capital of 50,000 ordinary shares with $1.00 par value. As of February 1,

2011 (incorporation date), one share was issued and outstanding, which was held by Mapcal Limited.

**UPCB Finance IV Limited**

**Notes to Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

On February 1, 2011, Mapcal Limited transferred its one share of common stock to MaplesFS Limited,

formerly known as Maples Finance Limited, making MaplesFS Limited the sole shareholder of the Company as
of February 1, 2011. MaplesFS Limited subsequently paid the outstanding $1 receivable to the Company on
February 3, 2011.

On February 2, 2011, the Company issued an additional 249 shares of common stock at par value to

MaplesFS Limited in exchange for cash.

Since February 2011, no other equity transactions have occurred.

**(4)** **Income Taxes**

There are no laws enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on the profits, income, gains

or appreciations of the Company and the Company has received an undertaking from the Governor in Cabinet in
the Cayman Islands exempting it from all local taxes on profits, income, gains or appreciations for twenty years
from February 8, 2011. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded by the Company, or
reflected in these financial statements.

**Independent Auditors’ Report**

The Board of Directors
UPC Holding B.V.:

**Report on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of UPC Holding B.V. (a B.V. registered in
the Netherlands) and its subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014
and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, owners’ deficit, and cash
flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

**_Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditors’ Responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly in all material respects, the
financial position of UPC Holding B.V. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

**_Emphasis of Matter_**

As disclosed in note 1 and note 4, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013, the consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive loss, owners’ deficit and cash flow for the years ended December 31,
2013, and 2012 and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to give
retrospective effect to a transaction accounted for as a common control transfer. Our conclusion is not modified
with respect to this matter.

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

**(1)** **Basis of Presentation**

UPC Holding B.V. (UPC Holding) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global), the

successor to Liberty Global, Inc. In these notes, the terms “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the
context requires, to UPC Holding or collectively to UPC Holding and its subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2014, we provided (i) video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services in

nine European countries and (ii) mobile services in five European countries. We also provide direct-to-home
satellite (DTH) services to customers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through a
Luxembourg-based organization that we refer to as “UPC DTH”.

During the first quarter of 2015, Liberty Global undertook various financing transactions in connection with

certain internal reorganizations of its broadband and wireless communications businesses in Europe. These
internal reorganizations include (i) the UPC Ireland Transfer, (ii) the UPC NL Transfer and (iii) the Corporate
Entities Transfer, each as defined and described in note 16. No effect has been given to these transactions in these
consolidated financial statements. Beginning with our quarterly report for the three months ending March 31,
2015, we will account for the UPC Ireland Transfer, the UPC NL Transfer and the Corporate Entities Transfer as
common control transfers at carryover basis and, accordingly, our consolidated financial statements will be
retrospectively revised to give effect to these transactions for all reported periods.

On January 26, 2014, Liberty Global’s board of directors approved a share split in the form of a share

dividend (the 2014 Share Dividend), which constitutes a bonus issue under Liberty Global’s articles of
association and English law, of one Liberty Global Class C ordinary share on each outstanding Liberty Global
Class A, Class B and Class C ordinary share as of the February 14, 2014 record date. The distribution date for the
2014 Share Dividend was March 3, 2014. All Liberty Global share and per share amounts presented herein have
been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 2014 Share Dividend.

During the first quarter of 2014, Liberty Global created a new credit pool consisting of both its Chilean

distribution and mobile assets. As a result, VTR GlobalCom SpA (VTR), certain of its parent entities and all of
its subsidiary entities (collectively, the VTR Entities) were extracted from UPC Holding in January 2014 (the
VTR Extraction). We have accounted for the VTR Extraction as a common control transfer at carryover basis
and, accordingly, our consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively revised to give effect to the
VTR Extraction for all periods presented. As such, all of the financial and operating data included in this report
exclude the VTR Entities for all periods presented.

Unless otherwise indicated, ownership percentages and convenience translations into euros are calculated as

of December 31, 2014.

These consolidated financial statements reflect our consideration of the accounting and disclosure

implications of subsequent events through March 20, 2015, the date of issuance.

**(2)** **Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,

_Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of_
revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 201409 will replace existing revenue recognition accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(U.S. GAAP) when it becomes effective, currently scheduled for January 1, 2017. Early application is not
permitted. This new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the
standard on our ongoing financial reporting.

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

**(3)** **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Estimates_**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make

estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and
assumptions are used in accounting for, among other things, the valuation of acquisition-related assets and
liabilities, allowances for uncollectible accounts, programming and copyright costs, deferred income taxes and
related valuation allowances, loss contingencies, fair value measurements, impairment assessments,

capitalization of internal costs associated with construction and installation activities, useful lives of long-lived
assets, share-based compensation and actuarial liabilities associated with certain benefit plans. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

**_Reclassifications_**

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

**_Principles of Consolidation_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all voting

interest entities where we exercise a controlling financial interest through the ownership of a direct or indirect
controlling voting interest and variable interest entities for which our company is the primary beneficiary. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash_**

Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and other investments that are readily convertible into cash

and have maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. We record money market funds at the net
asset value reported by the investment manager as there are no restrictions on our ability, contractual or
otherwise, to redeem our investments at the stated net asset value reported by the investment manager.

Restricted cash consists of cash held in restricted accounts, including cash held as collateral for debt and

other compensating balances. Restricted cash amounts that are required to be used to purchase long-term assets
or repay long-term debt are classified as long-term assets. All other cash that is restricted to a specific use is
classified as current or long-term based on the expected timing of the disbursement. Our restricted cash balances,
which are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets, aggregated €52.9 million and
€0.2 million, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Our significant non-cash investing and financing activities are disclosed in our consolidated statements of

owners’ deficit and in notes 4, 7 and 8.

**_Trade Receivables_**

Our trade receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Such allowance aggregated

€24.0 million and €29.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The allowance for doubtful
accounts is based upon our assessment of probable loss related to uncollectible accounts receivable. We use a
number of factors in determining the allowance, including, among other things, collection trends, prevailing and
anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk. The allowance is maintained until either
receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered to be remote.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number of customers

and their dispersion across many different countries worldwide. We also manage this risk by disconnecting
services to customers whose accounts are delinquent.

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

**_Financial Instruments_**

Due to the short maturities of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term liquid investments, trade

and other receivables, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, subscriber advance payments
and deposits and other current liabilities, their respective carrying values approximate their respective fair values.
For information concerning the fair values of our derivatives and debt, see notes 5 and 8, respectively. For
information concerning how we arrive at certain of our fair value measurements, see note 6.

**_Derivative Instruments_**

All derivative instruments, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the balance

sheet at fair value. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative instrument are recognized in earnings or loss. If the derivative instrument is designated as a fair value
hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in earnings or loss. If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in other comprehensive
earnings or loss and subsequently reclassified into our consolidated statements of operations when the hedged
forecasted transaction affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are
recognized in earnings or loss. We generally do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments. For
information regarding our derivative instruments, including our policy for classifying cash flows related to
derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of cash flows, see note 5.

**_Property and Equipment_**

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. We capitalize costs associated with

the construction of new cable transmission and distribution facilities and the installation of new cable services.
Capitalized construction and installation costs include materials, labor and other directly attributable costs.
Installation activities that are capitalized include (i) the initial connection (or drop) from our cable system to a
customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation of equipment for additional services,
such as digital cable, telephone or broadband internet service. The costs of other customer-facing activities, such
as reconnecting customer locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and repairing
or maintaining drops, are expensed as incurred. Interest capitalized with respect to construction activities was not
material during any of the periods presented.

Capitalized internal-use software is included as a component of property and equipment. We capitalize

internal and external costs directly associated with the development of internal-use software. We also capitalize
costs associated with the purchase of software licenses. Maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred
during the preliminary stage of an internal-use software development project, are expensed as incurred.

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the underlying

asset. Equipment under capital leases is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or
estimated useful life of the asset. Useful lives used to depreciate our property and equipment are assessed
periodically and are adjusted when warranted. The useful lives of cable distribution systems that are undergoing
a rebuild are adjusted such that property and equipment to be retired will be fully depreciated by the time the
rebuild is completed. For additional information regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment, see
note 7.

Additions, replacements and improvements that extend the asset life are capitalized. Repairs and

maintenance are charged to operations.

We recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which it is incurred if sufficient

information is available to make a reasonable estimate of fair values. Asset retirement obligations may arise from
the loss of rights of way that we obtain from local municipalities or other relevant authorities. Under certain
circumstances, the authorities could require us to remove our network equipment from an area if, for example,
we were to discontinue using the equipment for an extended period of time or the authorities were to decide not
to renew our access rights. However, because the rights of way are integral to our ability to deliver broadband

F-20

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

communications services to our customers, we expect to conduct our business in a manner that will allow us to
maintain these rights for the foreseeable future. In addition, we have no reason to believe that the authorities will
not renew our rights of way and, historically, renewals have been granted. We also have obligations in lease
agreements to restore the property to its original condition or remove our property at the end of the lease term.
Sufficient information is not available to estimate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations in certain of
our lease arrangements. This is the case for long-term lease arrangements in which the underlying leased
property is integral to our operations, there is not an acceptable alternative to the leased property and we have the
ability to indefinitely renew the lease. Accordingly, for most of our rights of way and certain lease agreements,
the possibility is remote that we will incur significant removal costs in the foreseeable future and, as such, we do
not have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of fair value for these asset retirement obligations.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the recorded value of our asset retirement obligations was €14.9 million

and €16.8 million, respectively.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Our primary intangible assets relate to goodwill, customer relationships and trade names. Goodwill

represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business
combination. Customer relationships and trade names were originally recorded at their fair values in connection
with business combinations.

Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with finite

lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual
values, and reviewed for impairment.

For additional information regarding the useful lives of our intangible assets, see note 7.

**_Impairment of Property and Equipment and Intangible Assets_**

We review, when circumstances warrant, the carrying amounts of our property and equipment and our

intangible assets (other than goodwill) to determine whether such carrying amounts continue to be recoverable.
Such changes in circumstance may include, among other items, (i) an expectation of a sale or disposal of a longlived asset or asset group, (ii) adverse changes in market or competitive conditions, (iii) an adverse change in
legal factors or business climate in the markets in which we operate and (iv) operating or cash flow losses. For
purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely
independent of other assets and liabilities, generally at or below the reporting unit level (see below). If the
carrying amount of the asset or asset group is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated
by such asset or asset group, an impairment adjustment is recognized. Such adjustment is measured by the
amount that the carrying value of such asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. We generally measure fair
value by considering (a) sale prices for similar assets, (b) discounted estimated future cash flows using an
appropriate discount rate and/or (c) estimated replacement cost. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower
of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on October 1 and whenever other facts and

circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations,
we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if goodwill may be impaired. If it is more-likely-than-not that
a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to
its respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment
(referred to as a “component”). In most cases, our operating segments are deemed to be a reporting unit either
because the operating segment is comprised of only a single component, or the components below the operating
segment are aggregated as they have similar economic characteristics. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
were to exceed its fair value, we would then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to its
carrying amount, and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an
impairment loss.

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and

liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the financial
statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits, that the position
will be sustained upon examination. Net deferred tax assets are then reduced by a valuation allowance if we
believe it is more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Certain of our valuation
allowances and tax uncertainties are associated with entities that we acquired in business combinations. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that
includes the enactment date. Deferred tax liabilities related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign
corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration are not recognized until it becomes apparent
that such amounts will reverse in the foreseeable future. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are
included in income tax expense. UPC Holding and its Dutch subsidiaries are part of a Dutch tax fiscal unity with
its ultimate Dutch parent company, Liberty Global Holding B.V. (Liberty Global Holding), and certain other
non-UPC Holding subsidiaries. The Dutch fiscal unity combines individual tax paying Dutch entities and their
ultimate Dutch parent company as one taxpayer for Dutch tax purposes. The income taxes of UPC Holding and
its subsidiaries are presented in our consolidated financial statements on a separate return basis for each tax
paying entity or group. For additional information on our income taxes, see note 9.

**_Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions_**

The reporting currency of our company is the euro. The functional currency of our foreign operations

generally is the applicable local currency for each foreign subsidiary and equity method investee. Assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries (including intercompany balances for which settlement is not anticipated in the
foreseeable future) are translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date. With the exception of
certain material transactions, the amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations are translated at
the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting unrealized cumulative translation
adjustment, net of applicable income taxes, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
earnings or loss in our consolidated statements of owners’ deficit. With the exception of certain material
transactions, the cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at the average rate for the
applicable period in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The impacts of material transactions generally are
recorded at the applicable spot rates in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. The effect of
exchange rates on cash balances held in foreign currencies are separately reported in our consolidated statements
of cash flows.

Transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are

recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Changes in exchange rates with respect to
amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to these non-functional currency transactions result
in transaction gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as unrealized (based
on the applicable period end exchange rates) or realized upon settlement of the transactions.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

_Service Revenue — Cable Networks. We recognize revenue from the provision of video, broadband internet_

and fixed-line telephony services over our cable network to customers in the period the related services are
provided. Installation revenue (including reconnect fees) related to services provided over our cable network is
recognized as revenue in the period during which the installation occurs to the extent these fees are equal to or
less than direct selling costs, which costs are expensed as incurred. To the extent installation revenue exceeds
direct selling costs, the excess revenue is deferred and amortized over the average expected subscriber life.

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

_Sale of Multiple Products and Services. We sell video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services_

to our customers in bundled packages at a rate lower than if the customer purchased each product on a standalone
basis. Revenue from bundled packages generally is allocated proportionally to the individual services based on
the relative standalone price for each respective service.

_Mobile Revenue — General. Arrangement consideration from mobile contracts is allocated to the airtime_

service element and the handset service element based on the relative standalone prices of each element. The
amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the handset is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon
the delivery of future airtime services. We offer handsets under a subsidized contract model, whereby upfront
revenue recognition is limited to the upfront cash collected from the customer as the remaining fees to be
received from the customer, including fees that may be associated with the handset, are contingent upon
delivering future airtime services.

_Mobile Revenue — Airtime Services. We recognize revenue from mobile services in the period the related_

services are provided.

_Mobile Revenue — Handset Revenue. Arrangement consideration allocated to handsets is recognized as_

revenue when the goods have been delivered and title has passed.

_Business-to-Business (B2B) Revenue. We defer upfront installation and certain nonrecurring fees received_

on B2B contracts where we maintain ownership of the installed equipment. The deferred fees are amortized into
revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance.

_Promotional Discounts. For subscriber promotions, such as discounted or free services during an_

introductory period, revenue is recognized only to the extent of the discounted monthly fees charged to the
subscriber, if any.

_Subscriber Advance Payments and Deposits. Payments received in advance for the services we provide are_

deferred and recognized as revenue when the associated services are provided.

_Sales, Use and Other Value-Added Taxes (VAT). Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales, use and other_

value-added taxes.

**_Share-based Compensation_**

We recognize all share-based payments from Liberty Global to employees of our subsidiaries, including

grants of employee share incentive awards based on their grant-date fair values and Liberty Global’s estimates of
forfeitures. We recognize the fair value of outstanding awards as a charge to operations over the vesting period.

We use the straight-line method to recognize share-based compensation expense for Liberty Global’s

outstanding share awards to employees of our subsidiaries that do not contain a performance condition and the
accelerated expense attribution method for our outstanding share awards that contain a performance condition
and vest on a graded basis.

Liberty Global has calculated the expected life of options and share appreciation rights (SARs) granted by

Liberty Global to employees based on historical exercise trends. The expected volatility for Liberty Global
options and SARs is generally based on a combination of (i) historical volatilities of Liberty Global ordinary
shares for a period equal to the expected average life of the Liberty Global awards and (ii) volatilities implied
from publicly traded Liberty Global options.

For additional information regarding our share-based compensation, see note 11.

**_Litigation Costs_**

Legal fees and related litigation costs are expensed as incurred.

**(4)** **Common Control Transfer**

As further described in note 1, we completed the VTR Extraction in January 2014. We have accounted for

this common control transfer at carryover basis and the applicable prior period information has been
retrospectively revised to give effect to this transaction for all periods presented.

Consideration received for the transfer of all outstanding shares of the VTR Entities to Liberty Global

Holding, a subsidiary of Liberty Global that is outside of UPC Holding, was €2,450.0 million. This amount,
which was settled through the Shareholder Loan (as defined and described in note 8), was recorded as a capital
transaction during the first quarter of 2014.

**(5)** **Derivative Instruments**

In general, we seek to enter into derivative instruments to protect against (i) increases in the interest rates on

our variable-rate debt and (ii) foreign currency movements, particularly with respect to borrowings that are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the borrowing entity. In this regard, through our
subsidiaries, we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and foreign
currency exposure with respect to the euro (€), the United States (U.S.) dollar ($), the British pound sterling (£),
the Swiss franc (CHF), the Chilean peso (CLP), the Czech koruna (CZK), the Hungarian forint (HUF), the Polish
zloty (PLN) and the Romanian lei (RON). We generally do not apply hedge accounting to our derivative
instruments. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of most of our derivative instruments are recorded in
realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments, net, in our consolidated statements of
operations.

The following table provides details of the fair values of our derivative instrument assets and liabilities:

(a) Our long-term derivative assets are included in other assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheets.

(b) We consider credit risk in our fair value assessments. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, (i) the fair
values of our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented assets have been reduced
by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating €7.6 million and €3.3 million, respectively, and (ii) the
fair values of our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts that represented liabilities have been
reduced by credit risk valuation adjustments aggregating €33.6 million and €77.1 million, respectively.
The adjustments to our derivative assets relate to the credit risk associated with counterparty
nonperformance and the adjustments to our derivative liabilities relate to credit risk associated with our
own nonperformance. In all cases, the adjustments take into account offsetting liability or asset positions
within a given contract. Our determination of credit risk valuation adjustments generally is based on our
and our counterparties’ credit risks, as observed in the credit default swap market and market quotations
for certain of our subsidiaries’ debt instruments, as applicable. The changes in the credit risk valuation
adjustments associated with our cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts resulted in net losses
of €47.7 million, €19.2 million and €57.6 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These
amounts are included in realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net, in our
consolidated statements of operations. For further information concerning our fair value measurements, see
note 6.

The net cash received or paid related to our derivative instruments is classified as an operating, investing or

financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the objective of the derivative instrument
and the classification of the applicable underlying cash flows. For derivative contracts that are terminated prior to
maturity, the cash paid or received upon termination that relates to future periods is classified as a financing
activity. The classification of these cash outflows are as follows:

**_Counterparty Credit Risk_**

We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to our derivative instruments will default on their

obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of,
and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our
derivative instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions.
Collateral is generally not posted by either party under our derivative instruments. At December 31, 2014, our
exposure to counterparty credit risk included derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of €427.9 million.

We have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each counterparty that contain

master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such derivative
instrument. The master netting arrangements under each of these master agreements are limited to the derivative
instruments governed by the relevant master agreement and are independent of similar arrangements.

Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to

exercise early termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against
sums due upon such termination. However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of
certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its insolvency representatives may be able to compel the
termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination payment liabilities payable by us,
reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in addition, the
insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set-off of amounts due under such derivative
contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant
counterparty. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have
present or future liabilities owed to us partially or fully discharged by set-off as a result of such obligations, in
the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though it is the counterparty that is in default and
not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so will depend on our liquidity
and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured creditor
in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any
collateral we have obtained from that counterparty.

In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the

relevant regulators may be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine

the settlement amount and/or compel, without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from
such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to
an alternative counterparty.

**(6)** **Fair Value Measurements**

We use the fair value method to account for our derivative instruments. The reported fair values of these

derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014 likely will not represent the value that will be paid or received
upon the ultimate settlement or disposition of these assets and liabilities. We expect that the values realized
generally will be based on market conditions at the time of settlement, which may occur at the maturity of the
derivative instrument or at the time of the repayment or refinancing of the underlying debt instrument.

U.S. GAAP provides for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to

measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are
inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. We record transfers of
assets or liabilities in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the quarter during which the transfer occurred.
During 2014, no such transfers were made.

All of our Level 2 inputs (interest rate futures and swap rates) and certain of our Level 3 inputs (forecasted

volatilities and credit spreads) are obtained from pricing services. These inputs, or interpolations or
extrapolations thereof, are used in our internal models to calculate, among other items, yield curves, forward
interest and currency rates. In the normal course of business, we receive market value assessments from the
counterparties to our derivative contracts. Although we compare these assessments to our internal valuations and

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

investigate unexpected differences, we do not otherwise rely on counterparty quotes to determine the fair values
of our derivative instruments. The midpoints of applicable bid and ask ranges generally are used as inputs for our
internal valuations.

As further described in note 5, we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage our interest

rate and foreign currency exchange risk. The recurring fair value measurements of these derivative instruments
are determined using discounted cash flow models. Most of the inputs to these discounted cash flow models
consist of, or are derived from, observable Level 2 data for substantially the full term of these derivative
instruments. This observable data includes most interest rate futures and swap rates, which are retrieved or
derived from available market data. Although we may extrapolate or interpolate this data, we do not otherwise
alter this data in performing our valuations. We incorporate a credit risk valuation adjustment in our fair value
measurements to estimate the impact of both our own nonperformance risk and the nonperformance risk of our
counterparties. Our and our counterparties’ credit spreads represent our most significant Level 3 inputs, and these
inputs are used to derive the credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our various interest rate and foreign
currency derivative valuations. As we would not expect changes in our or our counterparties’ credit spreads to
have a significant impact on the valuations of these derivative instruments, we have determined that these
valuations fall under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Our credit risk valuation adjustments with respect to our
cross-currency and interest rate swaps are quantified and further explained in note 5.

Fair value measurements are also used in connection with nonrecurring valuations performed in connection

with impairment assessments and acquisition accounting. These nonrecurring valuations include the valuation of
reporting units, customer relationship intangible assets, property and equipment and the implied value of
goodwill. The valuation of private reporting units is based at least in part on discounted cash flow analyses. With
the exception of certain inputs for our weighted average cost of capital and discount rate calculations that are
derived from pricing services, the inputs used in our discounted cash flow analyses, such as forecasts of future
cash flows, are based on our assumptions. The valuation of customer relationships is primarily based on an
excess earnings methodology, which is a form of a discounted cash flow analysis. The excess earnings
methodology requires us to estimate the specific cash flows expected from the customer relationship, considering
such factors as estimated customer life, the revenue expected to be generated over the life of the customer,
contributory asset charges, and other factors. Tangible assets are typically valued using a replacement or
reproduction cost approach, considering factors such as current prices of the same or similar equipment, the age
of the equipment and economic obsolescence. The implied value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair
value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in
a business combination, with the residual amount allocated to goodwill. All of our nonrecurring valuations use
significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not perform
significant nonrecurring fair value measurements during 2014 or 2013.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, all of our derivative instruments fell under Level 2 of the fair value

hierarchy.

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

Depreciation expense related to our property and equipment was €800.4 million, €771.2 million and

€785.7 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the amount of property and equipment, net, recorded under capital leases

was €36.2 million and €36.3 million, respectively. Most of these amounts relate to assets included in our
distribution systems category. Depreciation of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and
amortization in our consolidated statements of operations.

During 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded non-cash increases to our property and equipment related to

(i) certain vendor financing arrangements of €332.6 million, €177.0 million and €160.6 million, respectively, and
(ii) assets acquired under capital leases of €0.9 million, €1.5 million and €1.9 million, respectively. Furthermore,
during 2014, 2013 and 2012 we recorded non-cash increases to our property and equipment of €18.6 million,
€22.6 million and €10.2 million respectively, related to assets acquired on our behalf pursuant to vendor
financing and capital lease arrangements of Liberty Global B.V. (LG B.V.), a subsidiary of Liberty Global that is
outside of UPC Holding. For additional information, see notes 8 and 12.

If, among other factors, (i) our enterprise value or Liberty Global’s equity value were to decline

significantly, or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our
results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that
impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill, and to a lesser extent,
other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013 and based on exchange rates as of those dates, our accumulated goodwill

impairments were €173.3 million and €173.8 million, respectively. These amounts represent accumulated
impairments related to our broadband communications operations in Romania, which operations are included
within our Central and Eastern Europe segment.

(a) Represents the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2014 for all borrowings
outstanding pursuant to each debt instrument including any applicable margin. The interest rates presented
represent stated rates and do not include the impact of derivative instruments, deferred financing costs,
original issue premiums or discounts or commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing.
Including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees,
but excluding the impact of financing costs, our weighted average interest rate on our aggregate third-party
variable- and fixed-rate indebtedness was 7.8% at December 31, 2014. For information concerning our
derivative instruments, see note 5.

(b) Unused borrowing capacity represents the maximum availability under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility (as defined and described below) at December 31, 2014 without regard to covenant compliance
calculations or other conditions precedent to borrowing. At December 31, 2014, our availability under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility was limited to €906.7 million. When the relevant December 31,
2014 compliance reporting requirements have been completed and assuming no changes from
December 31, 2014 borrowing levels, we anticipate that our availability under the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility will be limited to €889.1 million. For information concerning transactions
completed subsequent to December 31, 2014 that could have an impact on unused borrowing capacity, see
note 16.

(c) The estimated fair values of our debt instruments are determined using the average of applicable bid and
ask prices (mostly Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). For additional information concerning fair value
hierarchies, see note 6.

(d) Amounts include the impact of discounts, where applicable.

(e) Primarily represents amounts owed pursuant to interest-bearing vendor financing arrangements that are
used to finance certain of our property and equipment additions. These obligations are generally due within
one year. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the amounts owed pursuant to these arrangements include
€4.6 million and €137.7 million, respectively, related to third-party vendor financing obligations for which
we and LG B.V. are co-obligors. We expect to cash settle the co-obligor obligations with LG B.V. in
advance of when we and LG B.V. are required to settle the obligations with the applicable third
parties. Our cash payments to LG B.V. will be reflected as cash capital expenditures in our consolidated
statements of cash flows and any cash payments made prior to the settlement of the related co-obligor
obligation will be reflected in our related-party accounts receivable from LG B.V. in our consolidated
balance sheets. In addition, the December 31, 2014 and 2013 amounts include €30.3 million and
€17.8 million, respectively, of VAT that was paid on our behalf by the vendor. Repayments of vendor
financing obligations other than the co-obligor obligations are included in repayments and repurchases of
debt and capital lease obligations in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

(f) UPC Holding has an unsecured shareholder loan (the Shareholder Loan) with its immediate parent, Liberty
Global Europe Financing BV (LGE Financing), which, as amended, is scheduled to be repaid in 2030 and
is subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the UPC Holding Senior Notes in the
event of (i) a total or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding up of UPC Holding, (ii) a bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, receivership or similar proceeding relating to UPC Holding or its property,
(iii) an assignment for the benefit of creditors or (iv) any marshaling of UPC Holding’s assets or liabilities.
Accrued interest is included in other long-term liabilities until the end of each fiscal year and then it is
transferred to the loan balance. The interest rate on the Shareholder Loan is a fixed rate of 9.79%. The net
increase in the Shareholder Loan balance during 2014 includes (a) cash borrowings of €4,185.0 million,
(b) cash payments of €3,522.4 million, (c) a €2,450.0 million non-cash decrease related to the
consideration received associated with the VTR Extraction, (d) a €1,005.3 million non-cash increase
related to the repayment of outstanding indebtedness under Facilities R, S and AE (as described below),
(e) additions of €878.2 million in non-cash accrued interest and (f) a €38.8 million non-cash decrease
related to the settlement of related-party charges and allocations. The net increase in the Shareholder Loan
balance during 2013 includes (1) cash borrowings of €2,435.9 million, (2) cash payments of
€2,309.3 million, (3) additions of €861.0 million in non-cash accrued interest, (4) a €40.0 million non-cash
decrease related to the settlement of related-party charges and allocations and (5) an increase of
€35.5 million in non-cash settlement of related-party capital additions. The net increase in the Shareholder
Loan balance during 2012 includes (I) cash payments of €2,272.6 million, (II) cash borrowings of
€1,265.0 million, (III) additions of €847.8 million in non-cash accrued interest, (IV) an increase of
€110.3 million in non-cash settlement of related-party capital additions and (V) a €68.0 million non-cash
increase related to the settlement of related-party charges and allocations. During the three-year period
ended December 31, 2014, none of the debt repayments were payments of interest. For information
concerning transactions completed subsequent to December 31, 2014 that impacted the Shareholder Loan,
see note 16.

(g) The fair values are not subject to reasonable estimation due to the related-party nature of these loans.

(h) Represents borrowings under (i) a loan agreement (the UPC Equipment Note) between a subsidiary of
Liberty Global and our subsidiary, UPC Equipment B.V. (UPC Equipment) and (ii) a loan agreement (the
UMI Loan) between Unitymedia Hessen GmbH & Co. KG (Unitymedia Hessen), a subsidiary of Liberty
Global that is outside of UPC Holding, and Unitymedia International GmbH (UMI). UMI, UPC
Equipment, and UPC International Operations B.V. (UPC International and together with UPC Equipment,
the UPC Leasing Entities), UPC Equipment’s immediate parent entity, were formed for the purpose of
acquiring and legally owning certain customer premises equipment assets to be leased to our subsidiary,
UPC Nederland B.V. (UPC Nederland), including certain assets that were the subject of sale and leaseback
transactions that were initiated in December 2011. Although UPC Holding has no equity or voting interest
in UMI, the transactions between (a) UMI and the UPC Leasing Entities and (b) UPC Nederland and, to a
much lesser extent, certain of our other subsidiaries, create a variable interest in UMI for which we are the
primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As such, UPC Holding is required by the provisions
of U.S. GAAP to consolidate UMI. The UPC Equipment Note (€78.4 million principal balance at
December 31, 2014) bore interest at 9.29% as of December 31, 2014. The UMI Loan (€27.5 million
principal balance at December 31, 2014) bore interest at 2.47% as of December 31, 2014. The net increase
in the aggregate balance of the UPC Equipment Note and the UMI Loan during 2014 includes (1) cash
borrowings of €67.3 million, (2) cash payments of €38.7 million and (3) the non-cash transfer of
€2.6 million in accrued interest to the loan balance. The net increase in the aggregate balance of the UPC
Equipment Note and the UMI Loan during 2013 includes (A) cash borrowings of €69.5 million, (B) cash
payments of €10.6 million and (C) the non-cash transfer of €0.6 million in non-cash accrued interest to the
loan balance. Subsequent to December 31, 2014 and in connection with the UPC NL Transfer (as defined
and described in note 16), the leasing transactions between UPC Nederland, UMI and the UPC Leasing
Entities were unwound, which resulted in an early termination fee of €87.0 million payable by UPC
Equipment. This early termination fee was funded through the UPC Equipment Note and paid to UMI and,
in turn, UMI repaid in full the UMI Loan and loaned the remaining cash amount to Unitymedia Hessen.

**_UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility_**

The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, as amended from time to time, is the senior secured credit

facility of UPC Broadband Holding. The security package for the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
includes a pledge over the shares of UPC Broadband Holding and the shares of certain of UPC Broadband
Holding’s majority-owned operating companies. The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility is also guaranteed
by UPC Holding, the immediate parent of UPC Broadband Holding, and is senior to other long-term debt
obligations of UPC Broadband Holding and UPC Holding. The agreement governing the UPC Broadband
Holding Bank Facility contains covenants that limit, among other things, UPC Broadband Holding’s ability to
merge with or into another company, acquire other companies, incur additional debt, dispose of assets, make
distributions or pay dividends, provide loans and guarantees and enter into hedging agreements. In addition to
customary default provisions, including defaults on other indebtedness of UPC Broadband Holding and its
subsidiaries, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility provides that any event of default with respect to
indebtedness of (i) €50.0 million or more in the aggregate of (a) Liberty Global Europe LLC (the indirect parent
of Liberty Global Europe Holding BV, Liberty Global Europe), (b) any other company of which UPC Broadband
Holding is a subsidiary and which is a subsidiary of Liberty Global Europe and (c) UPC Holding II BV (a
subsidiary of UPC Holding) and (ii) €15.0 million or more in the aggregate of any member of the UPC
Broadband Holding borrower group, is an event of default under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility permits UPC Broadband Holding to transfer funds to its parent

company (and indirectly to Liberty Global) through loans, advances or dividends provided that UPC Broadband
Holding maintains compliance with applicable covenants. If a change of control occurs, as specified in the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the facility agent may (if required by the majority lenders) cancel each facility
and declare all outstanding amounts immediately due and payable. The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility
requires compliance with various financial covenants such as: (i) senior debt (after deducting cash and cash
equivalent investments) to annualized EBITDA, (ii) EBITDA to total cash interest, (iii) EBITDA to senior debt
service, (iv) EBITDA to senior interest and (v) total debt (after deducting cash and cash equivalent investments)
to annualized EBITDA, each term as specified in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

The covenant in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility relating to disposals of assets includes a basket

for permitted disposals of assets, the annualized EBITDA of which does not exceed a certain percentage of the
annualized EBITDA of the UPC Broadband Holding borrower group, each term as specified in the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility. The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility includes a recrediting
mechanism, in relation to the permitted disposals basket, based on the proportion of net sales proceeds that are
(i) used to prepay facilities and (ii) reinvested in the borrower group.

The UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility includes a mandatory prepayment requirement of four times

annualized EBITDA of certain disposed assets. The prepayment amount may be allocated to one or more of the
facilities at UPC Broadband Holding’s discretion and then applied to the loans under the relevant facility on a pro
rata basis, as specified in the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. A prepayment may be waived by the
majority lenders subject to the requirement to maintain pro forma covenant compliance. If the mandatory
prepayment amount is less than €100.0 million, then no prepayment is required (subject to pro forma covenant
compliance). No such prepayment is required to be made where an amount, equal to the amount that would
otherwise be required to be prepaid, is deposited in a blocked account on terms that the principal amount
deposited may only be released in order to make the relevant prepayment or to reinvest in assets in accordance
with the terms of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, which expressly includes permitted acquisitions
and capital expenditures. Any amounts deposited in the blocked account that have not been reinvested (or
contracted to be so reinvested), within 12 months of the relevant permitted disposal, are required to be applied in
prepayment in accordance with the terms of the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

Holding, issued $1,400.0 million (€1,157.0 million) principal amount of senior secured notes in connection with
the VTR Extraction. The net proceeds from such senior secured notes of €1,005.3 million, together with an
additional €244.5 million of cash that was borrowed from another subsidiary of Liberty Global that is outside of
UPC Holding and €9.3 million of cash associated with the settlement of related derivatives, were used to repay in
full Facilities R, S and AE under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. In connection with this transaction,
we recognized a loss on debt modification and extinguishment of €5.3 million related to the write-off of deferred
financing costs.

During the first quarter of 2014, the full amount outstanding under Facility AF was repaid with funds

provided through the Shareholder Loan. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a loss on debt

For information regarding certain financing transactions subsequent to December 31, 2014 that impact the

UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, see note 16.

**_UPC Holding Senior Notes_**

_2014 Transactions. During April 2014, we used funds provided through the Shareholder Loan to fully_

redeem UPC Holding’s $400.0 million (€330.6 million) principal amount of 9.875% senior notes due 2018 (the
UPC Holding 9.875% Senior Notes). In connection with this transaction, we recognized a loss on debt
modification and extinguishment of €30.0 million, which includes (i) the payment of €14.3 million of redemption
premium, (ii) the write-off of €12.5 million of unamortized discount and (iii) the write-off of €3.2 million of
deferred financing costs.

_2013 Transactions. On March 26, 2013, UPC Holding issued (i) €450.0 million principal amount of 6.75%_

senior notes (the UPC Holding 6.75% Euro Senior Notes) and (ii) CHF 350.0 million (€285.6 million) principal
amount of 6.75% senior notes (the UPC Holding 6.75% CHF Senior Notes and, together with the UPC Holding
6.75% Euro Senior Notes, the UPC Holding 6.75% Senior Notes).

On April 25, 2013, the net proceeds from the issuance of the UPC Holding 6.75% Senior Notes were used to

redeem in full (a) UPC Holding’s €300.0 million principal amount of 8.0% senior notes due 2016 (the UPC Holding
8.0% Senior Notes) and (b) UPC Holding’s €400.0 million principal amount of 9.75% senior notes due 2018 (the
UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes). Our obligations with respect to the UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and the
UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes were legally discharged with the trustee on March 26, 2013 and March 27, 2013,
respectively, in connection with the issuance of the UPC Holding 6.75% Senior Notes. The trustee, in turn, paid all
amounts due to the holders of the UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes on
April 25, 2013. We incurred aggregate debt extinguishment losses of €65.9 million during the first quarter of 2013,
which includes (i) €27.5 million of redemption premium related to the UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and the
UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes, (ii) the write-off of €18.9 million of unamortized discount related to the UPC
Holding 9.75% Senior Notes, (iii) the write-off of €14.7 million of deferred financing costs associated with the UPC

incurred on the UPC Holding 8.0% Senior Notes and the UPC Holding 9.75% Senior Notes between the respective
dates that we and the trustee were legally discharged, as described above.

We collectively refer to the UPC Holding 6.75% Senior Notes, UPC Holding’s €600.0 million principal

amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2022 (the UPC Holding 6.375% Senior Notes) and UPC Holding’s
€640.0 million principal amount of 8.375% senior notes due 2020 (the UPC Holding 8.375% Senior Notes) as

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

(a) Amounts include the impact of discounts, where applicable.

Each issue of the UPC Holding Senior Notes are senior obligations that rank equally with all of the existing

and future senior debt and are senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of UPC Holding. The UPC
Holding Senior Notes are secured (on a shared basis) by pledges of the shares of UPC Holding. The UPC
Holding Senior Notes contain certain customary incurrence-based covenants. For example, the ability to raise
certain additional debt and make certain distributions or loans to other subsidiaries of Liberty Global is subject to
a consolidated leverage ratio test, as specified in the applicable indenture. In addition, the UPC Holding Senior
Notes provide that any failure to pay principal prior to expiration of any applicable grace period, or any
acceleration with respect to other indebtedness of €50.0 million or more in the aggregate of UPC Holding or its
restricted subsidiaries (as specified in the applicable indenture), including UPC Broadband Holding, is an event
of default under the UPC Holding Senior Notes.

At any time prior to August 15, 2015, in the case of the UPC Holding 8.375% Senior Notes, September 15,

2017, in the case of the UPC Holding 6.375% Senior Notes, and March 15, 2018, in the case of the UPC Holding
6.75% Senior Notes, UPC Holding may redeem some or all of such UPC Holding Senior Notes by paying a
“make-whole” premium, which is the present value of all scheduled interest payments until August 15, 2015,
September 15, 2017 or March 15, 2018 (as applicable) using the discount rate (as specified in the applicable
indenture) as of the redemption date, plus 50 basis points.

UPC Holding may redeem some or all of the UPC Holding Senior Notes at the following redemption prices

(expressed as a percentage of the principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts (as
specified in the applicable indenture), if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelvemonth period commencing on August 15, in the case of the UPC Holding 8.375% Senior Notes, September 15, in
the case of the UPC Holding 6.375% Senior Notes, and March 15, in the case of the UPC Holding 6.75% Senior

amount of 7.625% senior secured notes (the UPCB Finance I Notes), €750.0 million principal amount of 6.375%
senior secured notes (the UPCB Finance II Notes), $1.0 billion (€826.5 million) principal amount of 6.625%
senior secured notes (the UPCB Finance III Notes), $750.0 million (€619.8 million) principal amount of 7.25%
senior secured notes (the UPCB Finance V Notes) and $750.0 million (€619.8 million) principal amount of
6.875% senior secured notes (the UPCB Finance VI Notes and, together with the UPCB Finance I Notes, the
UPCB Finance II Notes, the UPCB Finance III Notes and the UPCB Finance V Notes, the UPCB SPE Notes),
respectively. The UPCB Finance I Notes, the UPCB Finance II Notes, the UPCB Finance III Notes, the UPCB
Finance V Notes and the UPCB Finance VI Notes were issued on January 20, 2010, January 31,
2011, February 16, 2011, November 16, 2011 and February 7, 2012, respectively.

The UPCB Finance I Notes were issued at an original issue discount of 0.862%, resulting in cash proceeds

before commissions and fees of €495.7 million. The UPCB Finance II Notes, UPCB Finance III Notes, UPCB
Finance V Notes and UPCB Finance VI Notes were each issued at par. UPCB Finance I, UPCB Finance II,
UPCB Finance III, UPCB Finance V and UPCB Finance VI used the proceeds from the (i) UPCB Finance I
Notes and available cash, (ii) UPCB Finance II Notes, (iii) UPCB Finance III Notes, (iv) UPCB Finance V Notes
and (v) UPCB Finance VI Notes to fund new additional Facilities V, Y, Z, AC and AD, respectively, (each, a
UPCB SPE Funded Facility, and together, the Funded Facilities) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility, with UPC Financing Partnership (UPC Financing) as the borrower. The proceeds from the Funded
Facilities generally were used to repay amounts outstanding under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility.

Each UPCB SPE is dependent on payments from UPC Financing under the applicable UPCB SPE Funded

Facility in order to service its payment obligations under each respective UPCB SPE Note. Although UPC
Financing has no equity or voting interest in any of the UPCB SPEs, each of the UPCB SPE Funded Facility
loans creates a variable interest in the respective UPCB SPE for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary,
as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As such, UPC Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding and
Liberty Global, are required by the provisions of U.S. GAAP to consolidate the UPCB SPEs. As a result, the
amounts outstanding under the Funded Facilities are eliminated in Liberty Global’s and UPC Holding’s
consolidated financial statements.

Pursuant to the respective indentures for the UPCB SPE Notes (the UPCB SPE Indentures) and the

respective accession agreements for the Funded Facilities, the call provisions, maturity and applicable interest
rate for each UPCB SPE Funded Facility are the same as those of the related UPCB SPE Notes. The UPCB SPEs,
as lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, are treated the same as the other lenders under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, with benefits, rights and protections similar to those afforded to the other
lenders. Through the covenants in the applicable UPCB SPE Indentures and the applicable security interests over
(i) all of the issued shares of the relevant UPCB SPE and (ii) the relevant UPCB SPE’s rights under the
applicable UPCB SPE Funded Facility granted to secure the relevant UPCB SPE’s obligations under the relevant
UPCB SPE Notes, the holders of the UPCB SPE Notes are provided indirectly with the benefits, rights,
protections and covenants granted to the UPCB SPEs as lenders under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility.

The UPCB SPEs are prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions

under the UPCB SPE Indentures.

(a) Amounts include the impact of discounts, where applicable.

Subject to the circumstances described below, the UPCB Finance II Notes and the UPCB Finance III Notes

are non-callable until July 1, 2015, the UPCB Finance V Notes are non-callable until November 15, 2016 and the
UPCB Finance VI Notes are non-callable until January 15, 2017 (each a UPCB SPE Notes Call Date). If,
however, at any time prior to the applicable UPCB SPE Notes Call Date, all or a portion of the loans under the
related UPCB SPE Funded Facility are voluntarily prepaid (an Early Redemption Event), then the applicable
UPCB SPE will be required to redeem an aggregate principal amount of its UPCB SPE Notes equal to the
aggregate principal amount of loans so prepaid under the related UPCB SPE Funded Facility. In general, the
redemption price payable will equal the sum of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the applicable UPCB SPE
Notes to be redeemed, (ii) the excess of (a) the present value at such redemption date of (1) the redemption price
of such UPCB SPE Notes on the applicable UPCB SPE Notes Call Date, as determined in accordance with the
table below, plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments thereon due through the applicable
UPCB SPE Notes Call Date (excluding accrued and unpaid interest to such redemption date), computed using the
discount rate specified in the applicable UPCB SPE Indenture, over (b) the principal amount of such UPCB SPE
Notes to be redeemed and (iii) accrued but unpaid interest thereon and additional amounts (as specified in the
applicable UPCB SPE Indenture), if any, to the applicable redemption date (the Make-Whole Redemption Price).
However, in the case of an Early Redemption Event with respect to Facility Z, AC or AD occurring prior to the
applicable UPCB SPE Notes Call Date, the redemption price payable upon redemption of an aggregate principal
amount of the relevant UPCB SPE Notes not exceeding 10% of the original aggregate principal amount of such
UPCB SPE Notes during each twelve-month period commencing on February 16, 2011, in the case of Facility Z,
November 16, 2011, in the case of Facility AC, or February 7, 2012, in the case of Facility AD, will equal 103%
of the principal amount of the relevant UPCB SPE Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and
additional amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date. The redemption price payable for any principal
amount of such UPCB SPE Notes redeemed in excess of the 10% limitation will be the Make-Whole Redemption
Price.

Upon the occurrence of an Early Redemption Event on or after the applicable UPCB SPE Notes Call Date,

the applicable UPCB SPE will redeem an aggregate principal amount of its UPCB SPE Notes equal to the
principal amount of the related UPCB SPE Funded Facility prepaid at the following redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, (as specified
in the applicable UPCB SPE Indenture), if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the
twelve-month period commencing on January 15, in the case of the UPCB Finance I Notes and the UPCB
Finance VI Notes, July 1, in the case of the UPCB Finance II Notes and the UPCB Finance III Notes, and

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

combines individual tax-paying Dutch entities and their ultimate Dutch parent company as one taxpayer for
Dutch tax purposes. Intercompany tax allocations between members of the Dutch Fiscal Unity are not subject to
tax-sharing agreements and no cash payments are made between the companies related to the Dutch tax
attributes. Furthermore, UMI has entered into a tax integration agreement and a profit-sharing agreement with its
immediate parent, Unitymedia Hessen, who is primarily liable for the related tax obligations. As a result, UMI’s
income is fully attributed to Unitymedia Hessen and no provision for income taxes has been made in our
consolidated financial statements for UMI on a separate return basis. The income taxes of subsidiaries other than
UMI that are not included within the Dutch fiscal unity are included in our consolidated financial statements on a
separate return basis for each tax-paying entity or group based on the local tax law.

For tax purposes, UPC Holding’s net operating losses for the year can be offset with taxable income of non
UPC Holding subsidiaries within the Dutch fiscal unity. UPC Holding and Liberty Global Holding do not operate
under a tax sharing agreement and no cash payments are made between the companies related to Dutch tax
liabilities.

The domestic (Dutch fiscal unity) and foreign components of our loss before income taxes are as follows:

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

(a) On January 1, 2013, a change in tax legislation was enacted restricting the deductibility of interest expense
in the Netherlands. This change resulted in no net impact to our current or deferred income taxes during
2013 as the increases in non-deductible interest were fully offset by decreases in our valuation allowances.

The current and non-current components of our deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

translation adjustments, (iii) the expiration of net operating losses and (iv) other individually insignificant items.

Our tax loss carryforwards within each jurisdiction combine all companies’ tax losses (both capital and

ordinary losses) in that jurisdiction, however, certain tax jurisdictions limit the ability to offset taxable income of
a separate company or different tax group with the tax losses associated with another separate company or group.
Most of the tax losses shown in the above table are not expected to be realized, including certain losses that are
limited in use due to change in control or same business tests. In addition, the pre-fiscal unity losses in the
Netherlands of Liberty Global Holding and of UPC Holding and its subsidiaries can only be offset with profits
that occur within these groups. Losses that relate to UPC Holding and its subsidiaries can also be offset against
profits of other entities within the fiscal unity of Liberty Global Holding.

Although we intend to take reasonable tax planning measures to limit our tax exposures, no assurance can

be given that we will be able to do so.

We and our subsidiaries file consolidated and standalone income tax returns in various jurisdictions. In the

normal course of business, our income tax filings are subject to review by various taxing authorities. In
connection with such reviews, disputes could arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or
application of certain income tax rules related to our business in that tax jurisdiction. Such disputes may result in
future tax and interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of tax
contingencies will take place upon the earlier of (i) the settlement date with the applicable taxing authorities in
either cash or agreement of income tax positions or (ii) the date when the tax authorities are statutorily prohibited
from adjusting the company’s tax computations.

In general, tax returns filed by our company or our subsidiaries for years prior to 2008 are no longer subject

to examination by tax authorities.

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

As of December 31, 2014, our unrecognized tax benefits included €17.5 million of tax benefits that would

have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that
we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances.

No assurance can be given as to the nature or impact of any changes in our unrecognized tax positions

during 2015.

**(10) Owners’ Deficit**

**_General_**

UPC Holding is a private limited liability company under Dutch law. The authorized share capital of our

company equals one hundred thousand euros (€100,000), divided into one thousand shares with a nominal value
of one hundred euros (€100) each. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, two hundred shares have been issued and
fully paid-in. All shares are registered; no share certificates can be issued. All shares are ordinary shares for a
private limited liability company under Dutch law. A shareholder wishing to transfer one or more shares must
first offer such shares to co-shareholders in a written notification to the management board, stating the number of
shares to be transferred, and the management board is required to notify the co-shareholders within two weeks.
Co-shareholders then have two weeks to notify the management board of a decision to purchase the shares. If the
company itself is a co-shareholder, it can only be entitled to act as an interested party with the consent of the
offer or of the shares. Each shareholder has the right of pre-emption in proportion to the aggregate nominal value
of its shares subject to certain limitations including as prescribed by Dutch Law. No preference or priority rights
exist for profit distribution, voting or dissolution and liquidation.

**_Deemed Distributions_**

In January 2014, we made a capital contribution of €325.6 million to VTR, which was used to acquire a loan

receivable (the UPC Broadband France Loan Receivable) from VTR to our subsidiary, UPC Broadband France
SAS, and pay related accrued interest. In December 2013, we made a capital contribution of €525.0 million to
VTR Finance. As a result of the change in reporting entities associated with the VTR Extraction, we have
accounted for these transactions as a deemed distributions in our consolidated statements of owners’ deficit and
cash flows.

**_Deemed Contributions_**

During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, VTR made aggregate cash distributions to our

company of €96.7 million and €69.9 million, respectively. As a result of the change in reporting entities
associated with the VTR Extraction, we have accounted for these transactions as deemed contributions in our
consolidated statements of owners’ deficit and cash flows.

**(11) Share-based Compensation**

Our share-based compensation primarily represents amounts allocated to our company by Liberty Global.

The amounts allocated by Liberty Global to our company represent the share-based compensation associated
with the Liberty Global share-based incentive awards held by certain employees of our subsidiaries. Share-based
compensation expense allocated to our company by Liberty Global is reflected as a decrease to parent’s deficit.

**_Share Incentive Plans — Liberty Global Ordinary Shares_**

_Incentive Plans_

As of December 31, 2014, Liberty Global was authorized to grant incentive awards under the Liberty Global

2014 Incentive Plan. Generally, the compensation committee of Liberty Global’s board of directors may grant
non-qualified share options, SARs, restricted shares, RSUs, cash awards, performance awards or any
combination of the foregoing under any of these incentive plans (collectively, awards). Ordinary shares issuable
pursuant to awards made under these incentive plans will be made available from either authorized but unissued
shares or shares that have been issued but reacquired by Liberty Global. Awards may be granted at or above fair
value in any class of ordinary shares. The maximum number of Liberty Global shares with respect to which
awards may be issued under the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan is 100 million (of which no more than
50 million shares may consist of Class B ordinary shares), subject to anti-dilution and other adjustment
provisions in the respective plan. As of December 31, 2014, the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan had
89,582,279 ordinary shares available for grant.

Awards (other than performance-based awards) under (i) the Liberty Global 2014 Incentive Plan and (ii) the

Liberty Global 2005 Incentive Plan generally (a) vest 12.5% on the six month anniversary of the grant date and
then vest at a rate of 6.25% each quarter thereafter and (b) expire seven years after the grant date. These awards
may be granted at or above fair value in any class of ordinary shares. No further awards will be granted under the
Liberty Global 2005 Incentive Plan.

_Performance Awards_

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions with respect to Liberty Global’s

performance-based awards for certain executive officers and key employees.

_Liberty Global PSUs. PSUs are granted to executive officers and key employees annually based on a target_

annual equity value for each executive and key employee, of which approximately two-thirds would be delivered
in the form of an annual award of PSUs and approximately one-third in the form of an annual award of SARs.
Each PSU represents the right to receive one Class A or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, subject to
performance and vesting. Generally, the performance period for the PSUs covers a two-year period and the
performance target is based on the achievement of a specified compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in a

consolidated operating cash flow metric (as defined in the applicable underlying agreement), adjusted for events
such as acquisitions, dispositions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect comparability (OCF
CAGR), and the participant’s annual performance ratings during the two-year performance period. A
performance range of 75% to 125% of the target OCF CAGR generally results in award recipients earning 50%
to 150% of their respective PSUs, subject to reduction or forfeiture based on individual performance. The PSUs
generally vest 50% on each of March 31 and September 30 of the year following the end of the performance
period.

_Liberty Global Challenge Performance Awards. Effective June 24, 2013, Liberty Global’s compensation_

committee approved the Challenge Performance Awards, which consisted solely of PSARs for Liberty Global’s
senior executive officers and a combination of PSARs and PSUs for other executive officers and key employees.
Each PSU represents the right to receive one Class A ordinary share or one Class C ordinary share of Liberty
Global, as applicable, subject to performance and vesting. The performance criteria for the Challenge
Performance Awards will be based on the participant’s performance and achievement of individual goals in each
of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. Subject to forfeitures and the satisfaction of performance conditions, 100% of
each participant’s Challenge Performance Awards will vest on June 24, 2016. The PSARs have a term of seven
years and base prices equal to the respective market closing prices of the applicable class on the grant date.

_General. UPC Holding charges fees and allocates costs and expenses to Liberty Global and certain other_

Liberty Global subsidiaries and Liberty Global and certain Liberty Global subsidiaries outside of UPC Holding
charge fees and allocate costs and expenses to UPC Holding. Depending on the nature of these related-party
transactions, the amount of the charges or allocations may be based on (i) our estimated share of the underlying
costs, (ii) our estimated share of the underlying costs plus a mark-up or (iii) commercially-negotiated rates.
Through June 30, 2014, our related-party operating and SG&A expenses and our related-party fees and
allocations generally were based on our company’s estimated share of the applicable estimated costs (including
personnel-related and other costs associated with the services provided) incurred by our company, Liberty Global
and the other applicable Liberty Global subsidiaries. The estimated amounts charged were reviewed and revised
on an annual basis, with any differences between the revised and estimated amounts recorded in the period
identified, generally the first quarter of the following year. The revisions to reflect the actual costs underlying our
related-party fees and allocations for 2013, 2012 and 2011 amounted to increases (decreases) of €15.3 million,
€2.2 million and (€0.7 million), respectively, in our net billings to Liberty Global and certain other Liberty
Global subsidiaries, which amounts were recorded during the first half of 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The
revisions to reflect actual costs for our related-party operating and SG&A expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011
were not material. During the third quarter of 2014, Liberty Global and its subsidiaries began basing the fees
charged and amounts allocated among Liberty Global and its subsidiaries on actual costs incurred. As a result,
during the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a €4.3 million increase to the net fees and allocations charged by
our company to Liberty Global and certain other Liberty Global subsidiaries to reflect the impact of this change
in methodology as of January 1, 2014. The impact of this change in methodology on our related-party operating
and SG&A expenses was not material. Although we believe that the related-party charges and allocations
described below are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the related-party costs and expenses reflected in
our consolidated statements of operations are reflective of the costs that we would incur on a standalone basis.
Except as noted below, our related-party transactions are generally cash settled.

For information regarding certain transactions subsequent to December 31, 2014 that impact our related
party fees and allocations, see note 16.

_Revenue. Amounts consist primarily of interconnect and other network access charges to Virgin Media Inc._

(Virgin Media), construction and programming services provided to certain non-consolidated affiliates, and

programming services provided to Chellomedia B.V. (Chellomedia) until the sale of substantially all of
Chellomedia’s assets by Liberty Global on January 31, 2014. Virgin Media is a subsidiary of Liberty Global that
is outside of UPC Holding.

_Operating expenses. Amounts consist of (i) programming and digital interactive services provided by_

Chellomedia until the sale of substantially all of Chellomedia’s assets by Liberty Global on January 31, 2014 and
programming services provided by another subsidiary of Liberty Global that is outside of UPC Holding in the
aggregate amounts of €18.3 million, €51.9 million and €57.6 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively,
and (ii) programming and interconnect fees charged by certain of Liberty Global’s affiliates of €7.7 million,
€6.3 million and €10.0 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, amounts reflect
(a) €12.7 million, €9.9 million and €7.4 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of encryption and
other operating expenses charged to Unitymedia KabelBW GmbH (Unitymedia KabelBW), (b) €7.7 million,
€0.2 million and nil during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of information technology-related expenses
charged by Virgin Media and (c) aggregate recharges of network-related and other items to (from) LG B.V. and
Liberty Global Europe Ltd. (LGE Ltd.), a subsidiary of Liberty Global that is outside of UPC Holding, of (€0.7
million), €2.1 million and €1.4 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

_SG&A expenses. Amounts consist primarily of net cash settled administrative and information technology-_

related expenses, primarily between our company, LG B.V., Virgin Media, Unitymedia KabelBW, LGE Ltd. and
other subsidiaries of Liberty Global that are outside of UPC Holding that resulted in net charges (credits) of
(€10.6 million), €6.8 million and €1.9 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

_Allocated share-based compensation expense. As further described in note 11, Liberty Global allocates_

share-based compensation to our company.

_Fees and allocations, net. These amounts represent the aggregate net effect of charges between subsidiaries_

of UPC Holding and various Liberty Global subsidiaries that are outside of UPC Holding, including (i) charges
to Unitymedia KabelBW of €106.1 million, €76.4 million and €53.7 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, which were partially loan settled, (ii) net charges to (from) Liberty Global and certain other Liberty
Global subsidiaries of (€41.6 million), (€11.0 million) and €10.3 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively, which were partially loan settled, (iii) aggregate net charges from LG B.V. and LGE Ltd. of
€40.0 million, €68.7 million and €61.6 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively and (iv) charges to VTR
Finance of €2.8 million, nil and nil during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These charges generally relate to
management, finance, legal, technology and other corporate and administrative services provided to or by our
subsidiaries and, in the case of charges to Unitymedia KabelBW, also include charges related to marketing and
other services that support Unitymedia KabelBW’s broadband communications operations, including the use of
the UPC trademark.

During the first three quarters of 2014, we allocated technology-based costs from our company to other

Liberty Global subsidiaries based on each subsidiaries’ estimated proportionate share of these costs. During the
fourth quarter of 2014, we changed the approach used to determine the amounts to be charged by our company
for technology services to other Liberty Global subsidiaries to a royalty-based method that was made
retroactively effective to January 1, 2014. During 2014, the €41.0 million proportional share of the technologybased costs we charged to other subsidiaries was €24.4 million more than the royalty-based technology fees we
charged under the new approach. Accordingly, the €24.4 million portion of our related-party receivables that was
attributable to this excess amount is reflected as a deemed distribution of technology-related services in our
consolidated statement of owners’ deficit. These technology-based charges are payable quarterly and are cash
settled unless otherwise determined by UPC Germany and Unitymedia KabelBW. In connection with the
Corporate Entities Transfer and the implementation of the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology (each as
defined and described in note 16), our company will receive technology-based charges from other Liberty Global
subsidiaries beginning in the first quarter of 2015. The charges under the new royalty-based fees are expected to
escalate in future periods. Any excess of these charges over our estimated proportionate share of the underlying
technology-based costs will be classified as management fees and added back to arrive at the consolidated
EBITDA figure used in our leverage covenant calculations.

associated with the settlement of our co-obligor vendor financing obligations with LG B.V., as further
described in note 8. With the exception of amounts related to our co-obligor vendor financing obligations
with LG B.V., these receivables are typically cash settled on a monthly basis.

(b) The December 31, 2013 amount represents the noncurrent portion the UPC Broadband France Loan
Receivable. For additional information, see note 10.

€25.7 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements of owners’ deficit in connection with the exercise of
Liberty Global SARs and options and the vesting of Liberty Global restricted share awards held by employees of
our subsidiaries. These capital charges, which generally are loan settled, are based on the fair value of the
underlying Liberty Global shares on the exercise or vesting date, as applicable. These capital charges, which we
and Liberty Global have agreed will not exceed the cumulative amount of share-based compensation allocated to
our company by Liberty Global, are based on the fair value of the underlying Liberty Global shares on the
exercise or vesting date, as applicable.

LG B.V. leases certain property and equipment on our behalf, which is then contributed by LG B.V. to our

company. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, LG B.V.’s carrying values in such property and equipment of
€18.6 million, €22.6 million and €10.2 million, respectively, have been reflected as decreases to parent’s deficit
in our consolidated statements of owners’ deficit.

Purchase commitments include unconditional purchase obligations associated with commitments to

purchase customer premises and other equipment that are enforceable and legally binding on us, including
€18.0 million associated with related-party purchase obligations.

Network and connectivity commitments include commitments associated with (i) satellite carriage services

provided to our company and (ii) commitments associated with our mobile virtual network operator (MVNO)
agreements. The amounts reflected in the table with respect to certain of our MVNO commitments represent
fixed minimum amounts payable under these agreements and, therefore, may be significantly less than the actual
amounts we ultimately pay in these periods.

Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming contracts that

are enforceable and legally binding on us in that we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the
actual number of subscribers to the programming services or (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our
subscribers or dispose of a portion of our distribution systems. In addition, programming commitments do not
include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are not
fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less
than the amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Payments to programming vendors
have in the past represented, and are expected to continue to represent in the future, a significant portion of our
operating costs. In this regard, during 2014, 2013 and 2012, the programming and copyright costs incurred by our
broadband communications and DTH operations aggregated €421.6 million, €410.2 million, and €402.0 million
respectively.

Other commitments relate primarily to (i) obligations associated with information technology and other

service agreements and (ii) certain fixed minimum contractual commitments associated with our agreements with
municipal authorities. Commitments arising from acquisition agreements are not reflected in the above table.

In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under

(i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to
make payments in future periods. For information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash
paid or received in connection with these instruments during 2014, 2013 and 2012, see note 5.

We also have commitments pursuant to agreements with, and obligations imposed by, franchise authorities

and municipalities, which may include obligations in certain markets to move aerial cable to underground ducts
or to upgrade, rebuild or extend portions of our broadband communication systems. Such amounts are not
included in the above table because they are not fixed or determinable.

Rental expense under non-cancelable operating lease arrangements amounted to €81.0 million,

€76.1 million and €71.1 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. It is expected that in the normal
course of business, operating leases that expire generally will be renewed or replaced by similar leases.

We have established various defined contribution benefit plans for our and our subsidiaries’ employees. The

aggregate expense of our matching contributions under the various defined contribution employee benefit plans
was €20.3 million, €19.0 million and €16.5 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

**_Guarantees and Other Credit Enhancements_**

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications to our lenders, our vendors and certain

other parties and performance and/or financial guarantees to local municipalities, our customers and vendors.
Historically, these arrangements have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not
believe that they will result in material payments in the future.

**_Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies_**

_Netherlands Regulatory Developments. In December 2011, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM),_

completed a market assessment of the television market in the Netherlands, concluding that there were no
grounds for regulation of that market. On December 22, 2011, referring to its final assessment of the television

F-55

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

market, ACM rejected previously filed requests from a number of providers to perform a new market analysis of
the television market. This decision by ACM was appealed by such providers to the Dutch Supreme
Administrative Court. On November 5, 2012, the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court rejected the appeals
against ACM’s decision.

In May 2012, the Dutch Parliament adopted laws that provide, among other matters, the power to ACM to

impose an obligation for the mandatory resale of television services and to the Commissariaat voor de Media to
supervise such resale obligation. These laws became effective on January 1, 2013, notwithstanding the
above-described November 5, 2012 decision of the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court. On January 29, 2014, a
Dutch civil court, in a proceeding initiated by UPC Nederland, declared the resale obligation laws non-binding
because they infringe European Union (EU) law. The Dutch Government did not appeal the January 2014
decision, and the resale obligation laws were formally withdrawn on November 26, 2014. We consider the
withdrawal of the resale obligation laws to be the final resolution of this matter.

_Financial Transactions Tax. Eleven countries in the EU, including Austria and Slovakia, are participating_

in an enhanced cooperation procedure to introduce a financial transactions tax (FTT). Under the draft language of
the FTT proposal, a wide range of financial transactions could be taxed at rates of at least 0.01% for derivative
transactions based on the notional amount and 0.1% for other covered financial transactions based on the
underlying transaction price. Each of the individual countries would be permitted to determine an exact rate,
which could be higher than the proposed rates of 0.01% and 0.1%. Any implementation of the FTT could have a
global impact because it would apply to all financial transactions where a financial institution is involved
(including unregulated entities that engage in certain types of covered activity) and either of the parties (whether
the financial institution or its counterparty) is in one of the eleven participating countries. Although ongoing
debate in the relevant countries demonstrates continued momentum around the FTT, uncertainty remains as to
when the FTT would be implemented and the breadth of its application. Based on our understanding of the
current status of the potential FTT, we do not expect that any implementation of the FTT would occur before
2016. Any imposition of the FTT could increase banking fees and introduce taxes on internal transactions that we
currently perform. Due to the uncertainty regarding the FTT, we are currently unable to estimate the financial
impact that the FTT could have on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

_Other Regulatory Issues. Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content_

businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from
country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the
regulatory structure of the EU. Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of
risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to
close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and
could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict
our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and
other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties.
Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.

_Other. In addition to the foregoing items, we have contingent liabilities related to matters arising in the_

ordinary course of business including (i) legal proceedings, (ii) issues involving VAT and wage, property and
other tax issues and (iii) disputes over interconnection, programming, copyright and carriage fees. While we
generally expect that the amounts required to satisfy these contingencies will not materially differ from any
estimated amounts we have accrued, no assurance can be given that the resolution of one or more of these
contingencies will not result in a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in
any given period. Due, in general, to the complexity of the issues involved and, in certain cases, the lack of a
clear basis for predicting outcomes, we cannot provide a meaningful range of potential losses or cash outflows
that might result from any unfavorable outcomes.

**(15) Segment Reporting**

We generally identify our reportable segments as those consolidated subsidiaries that represent 10% or more

of our revenue, operating cash flow (as defined below) or total assets. In certain cases, we may elect to include an
operating segment in our segment disclosure that does not meet the above-described criteria for a reportable

F-56

**UPC HOLDING B.V.**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)**

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

segment. We evaluate performance and make decisions about allocating resources to our operating segments
based on financial measures such as revenue and operating cash flow. In addition, we review non-financial
measures such as subscriber growth, as appropriate.

Operating cash flow is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment

operating performance. Operating cash flow is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to
(i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for
purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, operating cash flow is defined as
revenue less operating and SG&A expenses (excluding share-based compensation, related-party fees and
allocations, depreciation and amortization and impairment, restructuring and other operating items). Other
operating items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, (b) third-party costs directly
associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due
diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of
contingent consideration. Our internal decision makers believe operating cash flow is a meaningful measure and
is superior to available U.S. GAAP measures because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating
performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating
trends, (2) perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and (3) identify strategies to
improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate. We believe our operating cash
flow measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the
performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly
comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Operating cash flow should be viewed as a measure of
operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income, net earnings or loss,
cash flow from operating activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income or cash flows. A reconciliation of
total segment operating cash flow to our loss before income taxes is presented below.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, we began presenting (i) our operations in Switzerland and Austria as one

combined operating segment and (ii) the operations of UPC DTH as part of our Central and Eastern Europe
operating segment. These changes were made as a result of Liberty Global’s internal changes in organizational
structures, changes in how these segments are evaluated and monitored by Liberty Global’s chief operating
decision maker and the integration of certain functions within these reportable segments. Previously, (a) our
operations in Switzerland were a separate reportable segment, (b) our operations in Ireland and Austria were
combined into one reportable segment, “Other Western Europe,” and (c) the operations of UPC DTH were
included in our central and other category. Segment information for all periods presented has been revised to
reflect the above-described changes. For information regarding certain transactions that were completed
subsequent to December 31, 2014, that impact our segments, see note 16.

As of December 31, 2014, our reportable segments are as follows:

      - Switzerland/Austria

      - The Netherlands

      - Ireland

      - Central and Eastern Europe

All of the reportable segments set forth above derive their revenue primarily from broadband

communications services, including video, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services. All of our
reportable segments also provide B2B services and certain of our reportable segments provide mobile services.
At December 31, 2014, we provided broadband communications services in nine European countries and DTH
services to customers in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia through UPC DTH. In addition to
UPC DTH, our Central and Eastern Europe segment includes our broadband communications operations in the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Our central and other category includes (a) costs
associated with certain centralized functions, including billing systems, network operations, technology,
marketing, facilities, finance and other administrative functions, and (b) intersegment eliminations.

(a) As retrospectively revised — see note 4.

(b) Subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services, excluding
installation fees and late fees. Subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a
discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each
individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our cable and mobile products or the
composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period.

(c) B2B revenue includes revenue from business broadband internet, video, voice, wireless and data services
offered to medium to large enterprises and, on a wholesale basis, to other operators. We also provide
services to certain small office and home office (SOHO) subscribers. SOHO subscribers pay a premium
price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony or
mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential
subscribers. Revenue from SOHO subscribers, which aggregated €77.3 million, €58.2 million and
€41.0 million, respectively, is included in cable subscription revenue.

(d) Other revenue includes, among other items, installation, late fee, carriage fee and interconnect revenue.

**(16) Subsequent Events**

**_Overview_**

During the first quarter of 2015, Liberty Global undertook the financing transactions described below in

connection with certain internal reorganizations of its broadband and wireless communications businesses in
Europe. These internal reorganizations include:

   - the transfer on February 12, 2015 of UPC Broadband Ireland Ltd. (UPC Ireland) and its subsidiaries
from our company to certain other subsidiaries of Liberty Global outside of UPC Holding (the
UPC Ireland Transfer);

   - the transfer on March 5, 2015 of UPC Nederland and its subsidiaries to another subsidiary of Liberty
Global outside of UPC Holding (the UPC NL Transfer); and

   - the transfer on March 19, 2015 of Liberty Global Services II B.V. (Liberty Global Services II) and
Liberty Global Operations B.V. (Liberty Global Operations) from our company to certain other
subsidiaries of Liberty Global that are outside of UPC Holding (the Corporate Entities Transfer).
Liberty Global Services II and Liberty Global Operations incur central and other administrative costs.

**_UPC Ireland Transfer_**

The UPC Ireland Transfer comprised the transfer of (i) 100% of the shares of UPC Ireland and (ii) a

€634.3 million note receivable, for total consideration of €1,722.0 million. This amount was settled through (a) a
€1,175.7 million cash payment and (b) a €546.3 million non-cash reduction to the Shareholder Loan. The cash

**December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012**

consideration from the UPC Ireland Transfer, together with additional cash of €181.0 million that was funded
through the Shareholder Loan, was used to (1) redeem the full principal amount of the UPC Holding 8.375%
Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest and related redemption premium, (2) prepay in full the
€500.0 million outstanding principal amount of Facility V under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and the redemption premium related to the UPCB Finance I Notes, to
UPCB Finance I and, in turn UPCB Finance I used such proceeds to fully redeem the UPCB Finance I Notes and
(3) prepay €115.0 million principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest, of the €460.0 million
borrowings outstanding under Facility AI, which was drawn subsequent to December 31, 2014.

**_UPC NL Transfer_**

The UPC NL Transfer comprised the transfer of 100% of the shares of UPC Nederland for total

consideration of €5,371.8 million, all of which was settled through a non-cash reduction to the Shareholder Loan.
In connection with the UPC NL Transfer (i) certain lenders under the existing Facility AG under the UPC
Broadband Holding Bank Facility completed a non-cash roll of €684.2 million of their Facility AG commitments
into a new euro-denominated term loan (Facility AJ) under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility and
(ii) the lenders under Facility AJ increased their commitments to €689.2 million and rolled these commitments
into a new euro denominated term loan facility borrowed by another subsidiary of Liberty Global outside of
UPC Holding.

In addition, we borrowed cash of €1,465.6 million under the Shareholder Loan to prepay (i) the remaining

outstanding principal amount of Facility AG under the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, and (ii) €560.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of Facility Y under the
UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, together with accrued and unpaid interest and the redemption premium
related to the UPCB Finance II Notes, to UPCB Finance II and, in turn UPCB Finance II used such proceeds to
redeem €560.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of the UPCB Finance II Notes.

**_Corporate Entities Transfer_**

The Corporate Entities Transfer comprised the distribution of 100% of the shares of (i) Liberty Global

Services II and (ii) Liberty Global Operations to LGE Financing.

In connection with the Corporate Entities Transfer and the Liberty Global internal reorganizations

mentioned above, Liberty Global will be changing the processes it uses to charge fees and allocate costs and
expenses from one subsidiary to another, which, as further described below, will impact the calculation of the
“EBITDA” metric specified by our debt agreements. This new methodology (the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation
Methodology), which will be implemented during the first quarter of 2015, is intended to ensure that Liberty
Global continues to allocate its central and administrative costs to its borrowing groups on a fair and rational
basis. The implementation of the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology will be effected through the
Corporate Entities Transfer and will result in future decreases to our operating and SG&A expenses and increases
to our related-party fees and allocations. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, Liberty Global Services II and
Liberty Global Operations, along with certain other subsidiaries of Liberty Global, will charge fees and allocate
costs and expenses to our company and other Liberty Global subsidiaries, as appropriate. Subject to the specific
terms contained in our debt agreements, the implementation of the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology
will impact the calculation of the EBITDA metric for our company as the amount of related-party fees and
allocations that is included in our EBITDA metric will change. In this regard, the components of related-party
fees and allocations that are deducted to arrive at our EBITDA metric in 2015 and future periods will be based on
(i) the amount and nature of costs incurred by the allocating Liberty Global subsidiaries during the period, (ii) the
allocation methodologies in effect during the period and (iii) the size of the overall pool of entities that are
charged fees and allocated costs, such that changes in any of these factors would likely result in changes to the
amount of related-party fees and allocations that will be deducted to arrive at our EBITDA metric in future
periods. For example, to the extent that another of Liberty Global’s subsidiary borrowing groups were to acquire
(sell) an operating entity, and assuming no change in the total costs incurred by the allocating entities, the fees
charged and the costs allocated to our company would decrease (increase).

**2.** **THE FACILITIES**

**2.1** [Intentionally left blank]

**2.2** **Additional Facilities**

(a) Any person may, subject to the terms of this Agreement, become a Lender by delivering to the
Facility Agent an Additional Facility Accession Agreement in each case duly completed and
executed by that person,, UPC Broadband and, if the Additional Facility is to be granted to an
Additional Borrower, the relevant Additional Borrower. If, on the date the Additional Facility
Accession Agreement becomes effective, it is a requirement under Dutch law that a Lender needs
to be qualified as a Professional Market Party, such Lender must make the declaration and
representation set out in paragraph 4 of the Additional Facility Accession Agreement. That
person shall become a Lender on the date specified in the Additional Facility Accession
Agreement.

(b) Upon the relevant person becoming a Lender, the Total Commitments shall be increased by the
amount set out in the relevant Additional Facility Accession Agreement as that Lender’s
Additional Facility Commitment.

(c) Each Lender will grant to the relevant Borrower a term loan facility in the amount specified in
the relevant Additional Facility Accession Agreement in euros, US Dollars or an Additional
Currency (as applicable) during the Additional Facility Availability Period specified in the
Additional Facility Accession Agreement, subject to the terms of this Agreement.

(d) The execution by UPC Broadband and the relevant Borrower of an Additional Facility Accession
Agreement constitutes confirmation by each Guarantor that its obligations under Clause 14
(Guarantee) shall continue unaffected except that those obligations shall extend to the Total
Commitments as increased by the addition of the relevant Lender’s Commitment and shall be
owed to each Finance Party including the relevant Lender.

**2.3** **Overall facility limits**

(a) The aggregate amount of all outstanding Advances under an Additional Facility shall not at any
time exceed the relevant Total Additional Facility Commitments for that Additional Facility.

(b) The aggregate amount of the participations of a Lender in Advances under an Additional Facility
shall not at any time exceed that Lender’s Additional Facility Commitment for that Additional
Facility at that time.

**2.4** **Number of Requests and Advances**

(a) No more than one Request may be made under each Additional Facility unless an Additional
Facility Accession Agreement specifies otherwise, in which case the maximum number of
requests for Advances under that Additional Facility will be as set out in that Additional Facility
Accession Agreement.

(b) Unless the Facility Agent agrees otherwise, no more than five Advances may be outstanding at
any one time under each Additional Facility (other than Additional Facilities that can be redrawn)
and no more than ten Advances may be outstanding at any one time under each Additional
Facility that can be redrawn.

A-29


-----

**2.5** **Nature of a Finance Party’s rights and obligations**

(a) The obligations of a Finance Party under the Finance Documents are several. Failure of a Finance
Party to carry out those obligations does not relieve any other Party of its obligations under the
Finance Documents. No Finance Party is responsible for the obligations of any other Finance
Party under the Finance Documents.

(b) The rights of a Finance Party under the Finance Documents are divided rights. A Finance Party
may, except as otherwise stated in the Finance Documents, separately enforce those rights.

(c) Each of the Obligors and each of the Finance Parties agrees that the Security Agent shall be the
joint and several creditor (hoofdelijk crediteur) of each and every obligation of any Obligor
towards each of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document, and that accordingly the
Security Agent will have its own independent claim as creditor and not as agent against each
Obligor to demand performance by the relevant Obligor of those obligations. However, any
discharge of any such obligation to either of the Security Agent or the relevant Finance Party
shall, to the same extent, discharge the corresponding obligation owing to the other.

(d) Without limiting or affecting the Security Agent’s rights against any Obligor (whether under this
paragraph or under any other provision of the Finance Documents), the Security Agent agrees
with each other Finance Party (on a several and divided basis) that, subject as set out in the next
sentence, it will not exercise its rights as a joint and several creditor with a Finance Party except
with the prior written consent of the relevant Finance Party. However, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in the previous sentence shall in any way limit the Agent’s right to act in the protection
or preservation of rights under or to enforce any Security Document or the Security Deed as
contemplated by the Finance Documents (or to do any act reasonably incidental to any of the
foregoing).

**2.6** **UPC Broadband as Obligors’ agent**

Each Obligor:

(a) irrevocably authorises and instructs UPC Broadband to give and receive as agent on its behalf all
notices (including Requests) and sign all documents in connection with the Finance Documents
on its behalf (including but not limited to amendments and variations and execution of any new
Finance Documents) and take such other action as may be necessary or desirable under or in
connection with the Finance Documents; and

(b) confirms that it will be bound by any action taken by UPC Broadband under or in connection
with the Finance Documents.

**2.7** **Actions of UPC Broadband as Obligors’ agent**

The respective liabilities of each of the Obligors under the Finance Documents shall not be in any way
affected by:

(a) any irregularity (or purported irregularity) in any act done by or any failure (or purported failure)
by UPC Broadband;

(b) UPC Broadband acting (or purporting to act) in any respect outside any authority conferred upon
it by any Obligor; or

(c) the failure (or purported failure) by or inability (or purported inability) of UPC Broadband to
inform any Obligor of receipt by it of any notification under this Agreement or any other Finance
Document.

**3.** **PURPOSE**

**3.1** **Purpose**

Each Advance will be applied to finance the general corporate and working capital purposes of the

-----

**3.2** **Lender’s declarations and representations as Professional Market Party**

(a) Each Lender under an Additional Facility made available to a Dutch Borrower makes the
following declarations and representations to those relevant Dutch Borrowers:

(i) it is a Professional Market Party; and

(ii) it acknowledges that as a consequence it has no benefit from the (creditor) protection
under the Dutch Banking Act for non-Professional Market Parties.

(b) Each declaration and representation set out in paragraph (a) above is made by each relevant
Lender on the 2006 Amendment Effective Date and on each date that this Agreement is
amended, restated or supplemented.

(c) If on the date on which a Dutch Borrower accedes to this Agreement, it is a requirement under
Dutch law that a Lender needs to be qualified as a Professional Market Party in respect of
Advances to be made to that Dutch Borrower, each then current Lender under an Existing
Facility or an Additional Facility to which that Dutch Borrower is a Borrower shall make the
declaration and representation set out under paragraph (a) above to such Dutch Borrower.

**3.3** **No monitoring**

Without affecting the obligations of the Borrowers in any way, no Finance Party is bound to monitor or
verify the application of the proceeds of any Advance.

**4.** **CONDITIONS PRECEDENT**

**4.1** **Documentary conditions precedent**

(a) This Agreement will take effect on the day falling no less than five Business Days after the
Signing Date (the Effective Date) on which the Facility Agent notifies UPC Broadband and the
Lenders that it has received written confirmation from the Existing Facility Agents that the
conditions precedent in Clause 2(b) of the amendment and restatement agreement dated on or
about the date of this Agreement between, inter alia, UPC Broadband and the Existing Facility
Agents amending and restating the Existing Facility Agreement have been either satisfied or
waived and that such agreement is effective.

(b) No Borrower may draw an Advance under this Agreement until the Facility Agent has notified

received the documents referred to in paragraph (b) above as soon as practicable upon receiving

that:

(a) on the date of the Request for that Advance and on the proposed Utilisation Date the
representations and warranties in Clause 15 (Representations and Warranties) to be repeated on
those dates are and will be immediately after the relevant Advance is drawn down correct in all
material respects;

(b) on the date of the Request for that Advance and on the proposed Utilisation Date no Default is
outstanding or would result from the proposed Advance;

A-31


-----

(c) on the date of the Request for that Advance and on the proposed Utilisation Date no Change of
Control has occurred where the event has not been waived by the Majority Lenders; and

(d) the relevant Borrower confirms to the Facility Agent in the Request that the proceeds of such
Advance are only to be applied in accordance with Clause 3.1 (Purpose) and specifies the
relevant purpose of the proposed Advance in such Request.

**4.3** **Pro forma covenant compliance**

No Borrower may Request or obtain any Advance in an amount which, when aggregated with all other
Advances (and all Advances (other than Rollover Advances) (in each case as defined in the Existing
Facility Agreement)) (the Relevant Advances) made since the last day of the most recent Ratio Period
ending prior to the proposed date of that Advance for which financial statements have been delivered
pursuant to Clause 4.1 (Documentary conditions precedent) or Clause 16.2(a) or (b) (Financial
information) (the Relevant Ratio Period) would cause UPC Broadband to fail to be in compliance with
the financial ratios set out in Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios) for the Relevant Ratio Period, if such
financial ratios were re-tested for the Relevant Ratio Period after adding the aggregate amount of all such
Relevant Advances to the amount of Senior Debt and Total Debt used in calculating such ratios.

**4.4** **Deferred Acquisition Costs**

Where a member of the Borrower Group has made an Acquisition permitted by Clause 16.11
(Acquisitions and mergers), no Borrower may Request, or apply the proceeds of, any Advance for the
purpose of paying any consideration referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of Acquisition Cost in
relation to that Acquisition, unless UPC Broadband delivers to the Facility Agent on or before the date of
each relevant Request:

(a) where the Acquisition Cost of the acquisition was greater than €100,000,000 and no more than
€150,000,000, a certificate signed by two managing directors or the sole managing director, as
the case may be, of UPC Broadband and certifying; or

(b) where the Acquisition Cost of the acquisition was greater than €150,000,000, financial
projections based on assumptions which are no more aggressive (when taken as a whole) than
those used in the preparation of the Business Plan which demonstrate,

that the Borrowers will be in compliance with Clause 6 (Repayment) and the undertakings set out in
Clause 17 (Financial Covenants) for the period from the Utilisation Date of such Advance (taking into
account (i) the Acquisition Cost of such acquisition (but deducting from that Acquisition Cost the value
of any consideration referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of Acquisition Cost which has yet to be
paid or delivered), (ii) the amount of such Advance and (iii) financial projections relating to the acquired
business or asset(s)) to the Final Maturity Date.

forthwith on demand by the Facility Agent pay interest on the overdue amount from the due date
up to the date of actual payment, both before and after judgment, at a rate (the default rate)

(iii) the Mandatory Cost.

(b) In this Agreement Market Disruption Event means:

(i) at or about noon on the Rate Fixing Day for the relevant Term or Interest Period the Screen Rate

Facility Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations in an
Advance aggregate not less than one-third of that Advance) that the cost to it of obtaining

regulation,

the Facility Agent shall give notice to UPC Broadband and to the Lenders to that effect before 11.00 a.m.
on that day. In this event:

(i) UPC Broadband and the Lenders may agree that the drawdown will not be made; or

(ii) in the absence of agreement:

(A) that Lender’s participation in the Advance (or, if more than one Lender is similarly
affected, those Lender’s participations in the Advance) shall be treated as a separate
Advance denominated in euros during the relevant Interest Period;

(B) in the definitions of LIBOR or, as applicable, EURIBOR, (insofar as it applies to that
Advance) in Clause 1.1 (Definitions):

I. there shall be substituted for the time “11.00 a.m.” the time “1.00 p.m.”; and

claim, following which the Facility Agent shall promptly notify UPC Broadband.

(b) Each Finance Party shall, as soon as practicable after a demand by the Facility Agent, provide a
certificate confirming the amount of its Increased Costs.

**12.3** **Exceptions**

(a) Clause 12.1 (Increased Costs) does not apply to the extent any Increased Cost is:

(i) attributable to a Tax Deduction required by law to be made by an Obligor;

(ii) compensated for by Clause 10.3 (Tax indemnity) (or would have been compensated for under
Clause 10.3 (Tax indemnity) but was not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions in

(iv) attributable to the implementation or application of or compliance with the “International
Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, a Revised Framework” published

(excluding the Annualised EBITDA attributable to the VTR Group) represented
by the Annualised EBITDA of the person or asset disposed of for the latest Ratio
Period; and

(ii) **B equals the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Borrower Group**
(excluding the Annualised EBITDA attributable to the VTR Group) represented
by the Annualised EBITDA of the Target which is the subject of that Committed
Acquisition for the latest Ratio Period (based on the then available historical
financial information of the Target) (at the time of such disposal) and based on
the actual financial information of the Target (at the time of completion of the
relevant Committed Acquisition).

be calculated based on the most recently available financial information on a pro forma basis and using
the methodology for calculating operating cash flow used in the accounts most recently filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission by or on behalf of UPC Holding prior to the date of that
acquisition or disposal, and, for the avoidance of doubt, any corporate costs or allocations paid or payable
during the relevant period by a member of the Borrower Group which is being disposed of to one of its

and

(b) in relation to a Reinvestment, the percentage of the Annualised EBITDA of the Borrower Group
for what was the Latest Ratio Period at the time of the Reinvestment (but taking into account

of such pledge to the relevant member of the Borrower Group.

(b) Each Obligor shall ensure that each Subordinated Shareholder Loan and each shareholder loan

owed by or to a person incorporated in, the same jurisdiction as the relevant receivables or (as the
case may be) relevant person by or to whom such receivables are owed or in such other form as
the Security Agent may reasonably request and (ii) a Security Provider’s Deed of Accession and
shall provide the Security Agent with such evidence as it may reasonably request as to the power
and authority of such member of the Borrower Group to enter into such pledge of receivables and
Security Provider’s Deed of Accession and that the same constitute valid and legally binding
obligations of such member enforceable in accordance with their terms subject (to the extent
possible) to substantially similar qualifications to those made in the legal opinions referred to in
Schedule 2 (Conditions Precedent Documents), together with all such notices and other
documents as the Security Agent may reasonably require to perfect the receivables pledge.

not at the relevant time been applied in prepayment or reinvestment as described in Clause 7.6(b)(ii)
(Mandatory prepayment from disposal proceeds) and, excluding:

(a) any Financial Indebtedness which is a contingent obligation of a member of the Borrower Group;

-----

**17.3** **Calculations**

(a) For the purposes of Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios), Senior Debt for any Ratio Period will be
calculated on the basis of Senior Debt outstanding on the last day of that Ratio Period.

(b) For the purposes of Clause 17.2(a) and 17.2(e), Senior Debt and Total Debt for any Ratio Period
will be calculated on the basis of Senior Debt or Total Debt, as applicable, outstanding on the last
day of that Ratio Period but shall, in each case, be reduced by the aggregate amount of all Cash
and Cash Equivalent Investments held by any member of the Borrower Group at that time as
stated on the consolidated financial statements of the Borrower Group for that Ratio Period.

**17.4** **Cure provisions**

(a) UPC Broadband may cure a breach of the financial ratios set out in Clause 17.2(a), (b), (c),
(d) and (e) (Financial ratios) by procuring that additional equity is injected into the Borrower
Group by one or more Restricted Persons and/or additional Subordinated Shareholder Loans are
provided to the Borrower Group in an aggregate amount equal to:

(i) in the case of a breach of Clause 17.2(a) or (e) (Financial ratios), the amount which, if it had been
deducted from Senior Debt or Total Debt (as applicable) for the Ratio Period in respect of which
the breach arose, would have avoided the breach; or

(ii) in the case of a breach of Clause 17.2(b), (c) or (d) (Financial ratios), the amount which, if it had
been added to EBITDA for the Ratio Period in respect of which the breach arose, would have
avoided the breach; or

(iii) in the case of a breach of more than one paragraph of Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios), the higher of
the relevant amount referred to in (i) or (ii) above.

(b) A cure under paragraph (a) above will not be effective unless:

(i) the required amount of additional equity or the proceeds of Subordinated Shareholder Loans is
received by the Borrower Group before delivery of the financial statements delivered under
Clause 16.2(a) or (b) (Financial information) which show that Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios) has
been breached; and

(ii) in the case of a cure of Clause 17.2(a) or (e) (Financial ratios), the proceeds of the relevant
additional equity or Subordinated Shareholder Loans are applied in full in or towards repayment
or prepayment of Facility A Advances (as defined in the Existing Facility Agreement) in
accordance with Clause 7 (Cancellation and Prepayment) and, to the extent of any surplus after
such repayment or prepayment, for the purposes of the Permitted Business.

(c) No cure may be made under this Clause 17.4:

(i) in respect of more than five Ratio Periods during the life of the Additional Facilities; or

(ii) in respect of consecutive Ratio Periods.

(d) Where a cure is exercised under this Clause 17.4 in respect of a breach of Clause 17.2(b), (c) or
(d) (Financial ratios) and the next Ratio Period ends approximately three months after the Ratio
Period in respect of which the cure was made, EBITDA in respect of that next Ratio Period will
be deemed, for the purposes of Clause 17.2(b), (c) and (d) (Financial ratios), to be increased by
the amount determined under subparagraph 17.4(a)(ii) above in respect of the relevant cure. This
deemed increase will not be treated as a separate cure.

**17.5** **Determinations**

(a) Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower Group originally denominated in any currency other than
euro that has been swapped, directly or indirectly through one or more foreign exchange hedging
transactions, into euro, will be taken into account at its euro equivalent using the effective
exchange rate in the relevant foreign exchange hedging transactions.

A-78


-----

(b) All the terms used above are to be calculated in accordance with the GAAP on which the
preparation of the Original Borrower Group Financial Statements was based.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, Hedged Debt (as defined below) will be taken into
account at its euro equivalent calculated using the same weighted average exchange rates for the
relevant ratio period used in the profit and loss statements of the relevant accounts of the
Borrower Group for calculating the euro equivalent of EBITDA denominated in the same
currency as the currency in which that Hedged Debt is denominated or into which it has been
swapped, as described below.

**Hedged Debt means:**

(i) Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower Group originally denominated in any currency other than
euro in which any member of the Borrower Group earns EBITDA (a functional currency) and
that has not been swapped, directly or indirectly through one or more foreign exchange hedging
transactions, into euro; and

(ii) Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower Group that has been swapped, directly or indirectly
through one or more foreign exchange hedging transactions, into a functional currency.

(d) If there is a dispute as to any interpretation of or computation for Clause 17.1 (Financial
definitions), the interpretation or computation of the auditors of UPC Broadband shall prevail.

(e) If UPC Broadband is obliged or chooses to prepare its financial statements on a different basis
from the basis used in the preparation of the Original Borrower Group Financial Statements, such
financial statements shall be accompanied by a statement (providing reasonable detail) from UPC
Broadband either:

(i) confirming that the change(s) would have no effect on the operation of the ratios set out in
Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios); or

(ii) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Facility Agent (acting upon the instructions of the
Majority Lenders), if the change(s) would have such an effect, containing a reconciliation
demonstrating the effect of the change(s) (and, for the purpose of calculating the ratios set out in
Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios), such financial statements will be treated as though adjusted by that
reconciliation so as to exclude the effect of the changes).

**18.** **DEFAULT**

**18.1** **Events of Default**

Each of the events set out in Clauses 18.2 (Non-payment) to 18.20 (ERISA) is an Event of Default
(whether or not caused by any reason whatsoever outside the control of any Obligor or any other person).

**18.2** **Non-payment**

An Obligor does not pay on the due date any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents (other
than any amount payable by UPC Broadband under Clause 7.6(a) (Mandatory prepayment from disposal
proceeds) of this Agreement) at the place at, and in the currency in, which it is expressed to be payable,
unless the relevant amount is paid in full within one Business Day (in the case of principal amounts) or
three Business Days (in the case of other amounts) of the due date.

**18.3** **Breach of other obligations**

(a) An Obligor does not comply with any of Clauses 16.6 (Pari passu ranking), 16.7 (Negative
pledge), 16.10 (Disposals), 16.11 (Acquisitions and mergers), 16.13 (Restricted Payments),
16.14 (Loans and guarantees), 16.19 (Share capital) or 17 (Financial Covenants).

(b) An Obligor does not comply with any provision of the Finance Documents (other than those
referred to in paragraph (a) above or in Clause 18.2 (Non-payment) and other than non-payment

relevant Agent may, following consultation with and with the consent of UPC Broadband (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) forthwith appoint one of its Affiliates as successor Agent
or, failing that, the Majority Lenders may with the consent of UPC Broadband (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) appoint a reputable and experienced bank as successor Agent.
The resignation of the Security Agent is subject to compliance with clause 9.1 (Retirement of
Security Agent) of the Security Deed.

(b) If the appointment of a successor Agent is to be made by the Majority Lenders but they have not,
within 30 days after notice of resignation, appointed a successor Agent which accepts the
appointment, the retiring Agent may, following consultation with and with the consent of UPC
Broadband (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint a successor Agent.

(c) The resignation of the retiring Agent and the appointment of any successor Agent will both
become effective only upon the successor Agent notifying all the Parties that it accepts the
appointment. On giving the notification and receiving such approval, the successor Agent will
succeed to the position of the retiring Facility Agent and the term Facility Agent or Security
**Agent (as the case may be) will mean the successor Facility Agent or Security Agent,**
respectively.

and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the
purposes of performing its functions as the Agent under this Agreement.

notice must specify the reasons for which UPC Broadband is seeking the Agent’s resignation,

accordance with paragraph (a) above but it shall not be entitled to appoint one of its Affiliates as
successor Agent.

Finance Parties and UPC Broadband have relied upon such representation.

**19.16** **Separate divisions**

its other divisions and departments. Any information acquired at any time by either Agent otherwise than
in the capacity of Agent through its agency division (whether as financial adviser to any member of the
Borrower Group or otherwise) may be treated as confidential by the relevant Agent and shall not be
deemed to be information possessed by the relevant Agent in its capacity as such. Each Finance Party
acknowledges that each Agent may, now or in the future, be in possession of, or provided with,
information relating to the Obligors which has not or will not be provided to the other Finance Parties.

(a) No Obligor may assign, transfer, novate or dispose of any of, or any interest in, its rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement, except:

Finance Documents to which it is a party to another person which is the immediate Holding
Company of UPC Broadband (New UPC Broadband Holdco) in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the terms of such other Finance Document, provided that any transfer or
novation of obligations by Existing UPC Broadband Holdco will not be effective until New UPC
Broadband Holdco has become an Additional Guarantor in accordance with Clause 26.4
(Additional Obligors) and has delivered or delivers the documents specified in Clause 26.4(a)(v)
(Additional Obligors).

(b) At the time the foregoing conditions for the transfer or novation of Existing UPC Broadband
Holdco’s obligations shall have been satisfied (or waived, as the case may be) and such transfer
or novation has taken effect:

(i) Existing UPC Broadband Holdco will be released from its obligations under this Agreement and
the other Finance Documents, without prejudice to any such obligations which may have accrued
and shall not have been discharged prior to such time; and

(ii) Existing UPC Broadband Holdco will cease to be an Original Guarantor.

**26.2** **Transfers by Lenders**

(a) A Lender (the Existing Lender) may at any time after the day falling five Business Days after

Agreement and the other Finance Documents to another person (the New Lender), provided that
in the case of a partial assignment, transfer or novation of rights and/or obligations, such
assignment, transfer or novation shall be in a minimum amount (in relation to an Additional
Facility Commitment denominated in euros) of €1,000,000 or (in relation to an Additional
Facility Commitment denominated in US Dollars) of US$1,000,000 or, in each case, such lower
amount as the Existing Lender may agree with UPC Broadband (save that in the case of a partial
assignment, transfer or novation by a Lender of its rights and/or obligations under an Additional
Facility to an Affiliate or Related Fund of that Lender, such assignment, transfer or novation
shall be in a minimum amount (in relation to an Additional Facility Commitment denominated in
euros) of €500,000 or (in relation to an Additional Facility Commitment denominated in US
Dollars) of US$500,000 or, in each case, such lower amount as that Lender may agree with UPC
Broadband).

(unless to an Affiliate or to a Lender, but without prejudice to Clause 26.2(a)), provided that:

(i) UPC Broadband’s consent must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;

(ii) the consent of UPC Broadband to an assignment, transfer or novation must not be withheld solely
because the assignment, novation or transfer may result in an increase to the Mandatory Cost;

(iii) the prior consent of UPC Broadband is not required when (A) the assignment, novation or
transfer of a Lender’s rights and/or obligations is to an Affiliate or Related Fund of that Lender
or (B) an Event of Default is outstanding;

(iv) nothing in this Clause 26.2 restricts the ability of any Lender to enter into any sub-participation
or other arrangement with any third party relating to the Finance Documents which does not
transfer to that third party any obligation and/or legal or equitable interest in any of the rights
arising under this Agreement.

A-93


-----

(c) A transfer of obligations will be effective only if the obligations are novated in accordance with
Clause 26.3 (Procedure for novations).

(d) If, on the date of an assignment, transfer or novation of rights and/or obligations, it is a
requirement of Dutch law that each Lender must be a Professional Market Party, then on the date
that such assignment, transfer or novation becomes effective, the New Lender must make the
declaration and representation on the terms set out in paragraph 2 of the Novation Certificate.

(e) On each occasion an Existing Lender assigns, transfers or novates any of its rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement (other than to an Affiliate or Related Fund of that Existing
Lender), the New Lender shall, on the date the assignment, transfer and/or novation takes effect,
pay to the Facility Agent for its own account a fee of €1,500.

(f) An Existing Lender is not responsible to a New Lender for:

(i) the execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or sufficiency of any Finance Document or
any other document;

(ii) the collectability of amounts payable under any Finance Document; or

(iii) the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in connection with any Finance
Document.

(g) Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties that:

(i) it has made its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and
affairs of each Obligor and its related entities in connection with its participation in this
Agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing
Lender in connection with any Finance Document; and

(ii) it will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor
and its related entities while any amount is or may be outstanding under this Agreement or any
Additional Facility Commitment is in force; and

(iii) where such New Lender is a Lender under an Additional Facility to which a Dutch Borrower is a
Borrower it is a Professional Market Party and that it is aware that it therefore does not benefit
from the (creditor) protection under the Dutch Banking Act for non-Professional Market Parties.

(h) Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

(i) accept a re-transfer from a New Lender of any of the rights and/or obligations assigned,
transferred or novated under this Clause 26; or

(ii) support any losses incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor
of its obligations under this Agreement or otherwise.

(i) Any reference in this Agreement to a Lender includes a New Lender (to the extent rights have
been assigned, transferred or novated to that New Lender and to the extent that obligations have
been assumed by the New Lender) but excludes a Lender if no amount is or may be owed to or
by it under this Agreement and its Additional Facility Commitment has been cancelled or
reduced to nil.

(j) If any assignment, transfer or novation results, or will result by reason of circumstances existing
at the time of the assignment, transfer or novation, in additional amounts becoming due under
Clause 10 (Tax Gross-up and Indemnities) or amounts becoming due under Clause 12 (Increased
Costs), the New Lender shall be entitled to receive such additional amounts only to the extent
that the Existing Lender would have been so entitled had there been no such assignment, transfer
or novation.

A-94


-----

**26.3** **Procedure for novations**

(a) A novation is effected if:

(i) the Existing Lender and the New Lender deliver to the Facility Agent a duly completed
certificate (a Novation Certificate), substantially in the form of Part 1 of Schedule 5 (Novation
Certificate); and

(ii) the Facility Agent executes it (which the Facility Agent shall promptly do).

(b) Each Finance Party (other than the Existing Lender and the New Lender) irrevocably authorises
the Facility Agent to execute any duly completed Novation Certificate on its behalf if that
Novation Certificate effects a novation permitted by Clause 26.2 (Transfers by Lenders).

(c) To the extent that they are expressed to be the subject of the novation in the Novation Certificate
and subject to paragraph (e) below:

(i) the Existing Lender and the other Parties (the existing Parties) will be released from their
obligations to each other (the discharged obligations);

(ii) the New Lender and the existing Parties will assume obligations towards each other which differ
from the discharged obligations only insofar as they are owed to or assumed by the New Lender
instead of the Existing Lender;

(iii) the rights of the Existing Lender against the existing Parties and vice versa (the discharged
**rights) will be cancelled;**

(iv) the New Lender and the existing Parties will acquire rights against each other which differ from
the discharged rights only insofar as they are exercisable by or against the New Lender instead of
the Existing Lender; and

(v) the New Lender shall become, by the execution by the Facility Agent of such Novation
Certificate, bound by the terms of the Security Deed as if it were an original party thereto as a
Senior Beneficiary and shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations towards the
other parties to the Security Deed as would have been acquired and assumed had the New Lender
been an original party to the Security Deed as a Senior Beneficiary,

all on the later of (i) five Business Days after receipt of a Novation Certificate executed by the Existing
Lender and the New Lender; (ii) the date of execution of such Novation Certificate by the Facility Agent
or; (iii) the date specified in the Novation Certificate.

(d) If the effective date of a novation is after the date a Request is received by the Facility Agent but
before the date the requested Advance is disbursed to the relevant Borrower, the Existing Lender
shall be obliged to participate in that Advance in respect of its discharged obligations
notwithstanding that novation, and the New Lender shall reimburse the Existing Lender for its
participation in that Advance and all interest and fees thereon up to the date of reimbursement (in
each case to the extent attributable to the discharged obligations) within three Business Days of
the Utilisation Date of that Advance.

(e) If an Existing Lender effects a Mid-Interest Period Transfer:

(i) the Facility Agent has an obligation to make interest accruing on and prior to the date on which
the Mid-Interest Period Transfer took effect (the Pre-Transfer Accrued Interest) available to
the Existing Lender in accordance with Clause 9.3 (Distribution). Once such Accrued Interest has
been made available to the Existing Lender in accordance with Clause 9.3 (Distribution), the
Facility Agent will be released from all obligations towards the Existing Lender;

(ii) the Facility Agent will have no obligation to pay Pre-Transfer Accrued Interest to the New
Lender;

A-95


-----

(iii) such Existing Lender will continue to have the right to receive Pre-Transfer Accrued Interest.
Once such Pre-Transfer Accrued Interest has been made available to such Existing Lender in
accordance with Clause 9.3 (Distribution), all rights of such Existing Lender against the Facility
Agent will be cancelled; and

(iv) the New Lender will have no right to receive Pre-Transfer Accrued Interest from the Facility
Agent.

**26.4** **Additional Obligors**

(a) (i) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, a Subsidiary of UPC Broadband may become an

(vi) The Obligor Accession Agreement referred to in subparagraph (i) above may, in the case of an

(i) procure that at all times the value of the aggregate EBITDA of:

(A) the Guarantors as of the Effective Date (other than UPC Broadband, any UPC Broadband

financial statements delivered under Clause 16.2(a) or (b) (Financial information) which
demonstrate that additional Subsidiaries of UPC Broadband are required to be become Additional
Guarantors under paragraph (b).

Additional Guarantor or Additional Borrower (if applicable) that the relevant representations and
warranties set out in Clause 15 (Representations and Warranties) to be made by it on the date of
the Obligor Accession Agreement are correct, as if made with reference to the facts and

If any amount owing by an Obligor under any Finance Document to a Finance Party (the recovering
**Finance Party) is discharged by payment, set-off or any other manner other than through the Facility**
Agent in accordance with Clause 9 (Payments) (a recovery), then:

(a) the recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of the recovery to
the Facility Agent;

(b) the Facility Agent shall determine whether the recovery is in excess of the amount which the
recovering Finance Party would have received had the recovery been received by the Facility
Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 9 (Payments);

Days of demand by the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the redistribution)

under Clause 9 (Payments) and shall pay the redistribution to the Finance Parties (other than the
recovering Finance Party) in accordance with Clause 9.7 (Partial payments); and

(e) after payment of the full redistribution, the recovering Finance Party will be subrogated to the
portion of the claims paid under paragraph (d) above, and that Obligor will owe the recovering
Finance Party a debt which is equal to the redistribution, immediately payable and of the type
originally discharged.

**29.2** **Reversal of redistribution**

If under Clause 29.1 (Redistribution):

(a) a recovering Finance Party must subsequently return a recovery, or an amount measured by
reference to a recovery, to an Obligor; and

(b) the recovering Finance Party has paid a redistribution in relation to that recovery,

each Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the recovering Finance Party through
the Facility Agent, reimburse the recovering Finance Party all or the appropriate portion of the
redistribution paid to that Finance Party. Thereupon the subrogation in Clause 29.1(e) (Redistribution)

Each Finance Party agrees with the Facility Agent that it will comply with any notice given to it by the
Facility Agent under this Clause 29.2.

**29.3** **Exceptions**

(a) A recovering Finance Party need not pay a redistribution to the extent that it would not, after the
payment, have a valid claim against the Obligor concerned in the amount of the redistribution
pursuant to Clause 29.1(e) (Redistribution).

(b) A recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any amount
which the recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal

Where:

E is designed to compensate the Reference Banks for amounts payable under the Fees Rules (but, for this
purpose, ignoring any minimum fee required pursuant to the Fees Rules) and is calculated by the

6. If requested by the Facility Agent, each Reference Bank shall, as soon as practicable after publication by the
Financial Services Authority, supply to the Facility Agent, the rate of charge payable by that Reference
Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Rules in respect of the relevant financial year
of the Financial Services Authority (calculated for this purpose by that Reference Bank as being the average
of the Fee Tariffs applicable to that Reference Bank for that financial year) and expressed in pounds per
£1,000,000 of the Tariff Base of that Reference Bank.

7. Each Lender shall supply any information required by the Facility Agent for the purpose of calculating its
Additional Cost Rate. In particular, but without limitation, each Lender shall supply the following

provided by any Reference Bank pursuant to paragraph 3 above is true and correct in all respects.

to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of

**PART 2**

**FORM OF LSTA CONFIDENTIALITY UNDERTAKING**

Master Confidentiality Agreement dated as of [ ] (this Agreement) between [Existing Lender] (the

**Existing Lender) and [New Lender] (the New Lender).**

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions that will apply, in each instance, to the treatment of certain
non-public information that the Existing Lender may supply to the New Lender in connection with the
consideration by the New Lender of its participating in any financing or proposed financing (a Financing) for
any borrower or group of borrowers (each a Borrower) specified in a Schedule described below.

As used herein: (a) Evaluation Material refers to (i) the non-public information furnished to the Existing
Lender, including any Information Memorandum, in respect of a particular Financing of a Borrower that the
Existing Lender supplies to the New Lender on or after the date of the Schedule in respect of such Financing,
(ii) all memoranda, notes, and other documents and analyses (collectively, analyses) internally developed by the
Existing Lender that it supplies to the New Lender and (iii) all analyses developed by the New Lender using any
information specified under clauses (i) and (ii) above; (b) Internal Evaluation Material refers to analyses
specified under clause (iii) of the definition of Evaluation Material; and (c) participation refers to a transfer of a
lender’s interest in a Financing (or a grant of derivative rights in respect thereof), whether by assignment,
participation or otherwise (and participate and participating shall have correlative meanings thereto).

As a condition to the Existing Lender’s furnishing the New Lender with any Evaluation Material in the Existing
Lender’s possession in respect of a particular Financing, the New Lender shall execute and return to the Existing
Lender a schedule, in substantially the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, that the Existing Lender may have
completed, executed and delivered to it (a Schedule). Each Schedule shall identify the Existing Lender and the
New Lender in respect of such Financing and the related Evaluation Material, the name of each Borrower that the
New Lender has under consideration and a description of the documentation (the Operative Documentation) in
respect thereof.

The New Lender in respect of a particular Financing agrees that it will use all Evaluation Material in respect of
such Financing solely for the purpose of evaluating its possible participation, or obtaining the participation of
another eligible person (an Additional Assignee), in such Financing and that the New Lender will use reasonable
precautions in accordance with its established procedures to keep such information confidential; provided,
however, that any such information may be disclosed to the partners, directors, officers, employees, agents,
counsel, auditors, affiliates, advisors and representatives (collectively, Representatives) of the New Lender’s
institution who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating its participation in such Financing
(it being understood that such Representatives shall be informed by the New Lender of the confidential nature of
such information and shall be directed by it to treat such information in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) and to any Additional Assignee and its Representatives (provided that such Additional Assignee
shall have previously executed and delivered to the New Lender an agreement in substantially the same
substance as this Agreement in respect of the Evaluation Material). The New Lender agrees to be responsible for
any breach of this Agreement that results from the actions or omissions of its Representatives. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the New Lender will not use such information to obtain an Additional Assignee if otherwise
prohibited by agreements binding on the New Lender.

In addition, the New Lender in respect of a particular Financing agrees that prior to the settlement of its
participation in such Financing, it will not disclose to any person, other than its Representatives, the identity of
the Existing Lender with which discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the New Lender’s
possible participation in the related Financing or any of the terms or conditions of such proposed participation.
The term person as used in this Agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include the media and any corporation,
partnership, group, individual or other entity and, if the New Lender’s participation in the Financing would
constitute a secondary market transaction, the Borrower.

The New Lender in respect of a particular Financing shall be permitted to disclose any related Evaluation
Material (and the fact that such Evaluation Material has been made available to it and that discussions or
negotiations are taking place concerning the transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect
thereto) in the event that the New Lender is required by law or regulation or requested by any governmental
agency or other regulatory authority (including any self-regulatory organization having or claiming to have
jurisdiction) or in connection with any legal proceedings. The New Lender agrees that it will notify the Existing
Lender as soon as practical in the event of any such disclosure (other than as a result of an examination by any
regulatory agency), unless such notification shall be prohibited by applicable law or legal process.

A-122


-----

The New Lender in respect of a particular Financing and its Representatives shall have no obligation hereunder
with respect to any information in any related Evaluation Material to the extent that such information (i) is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the New Lender in violation of
this Agreement, (ii) was within the New Lender’s possession prior to its being furnished to it pursuant hereto,
provided that the source of such information was not known by the New Lender to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Borrower or any other
party with respect to such information or (iii) is or becomes available to the New Lender on a non-confidential
basis from a source other than the Borrower or the Existing Lender, or their respective Representatives, provided
that such source is not known by the New Lender to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Existing Lender, the Borrower or any other
party with respect to such information.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this letter, any party to this letter (and any of its affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, representatives, professional advisers, or other agents) may and has since the
commencement of discussions with respect to the Facility been permitted to disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind:

(a) the U.S. tax treatment and U.S. tax structure (each as defined below) of the Facility; and

(b) all material of any kind (including opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating
to such U.S. tax treatment or U.S. tax structure,

except to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with applicable federal or state securities laws.

For the purposes of this subsection, the U.S. tax treatment of the Facility is the purported or claimed U.S.
federal, state and local income tax treatment of the Facility, and the U.S. tax structure of the Facility is any fact
that may be relevant to understanding the purported or claimed U.S. federal, state and local income tax treatment
of the Facility. This authorisation is not intended to permit disclosure of any information (other than information
relating to U.S. tax treatment or U.S. tax structure of the Facility) including (without limitation) (i) any portion of
any materials to the extent not related to the U.S. tax treatment or U.S. tax structure of the Facility, (ii) the
identities of participants or potential participants in the Facility (except to the extent such identities are related to
the tax treatment or the U.S. tax structure of the Facility), (iii) the existence or status of any negotiations, (iv) any
pricing or financial information (except to the extent such pricing or financial information is related to the U.S.
tax treatment or the U.S. tax structure of the Facility), or (v) any other term or detail not relevant to the U.S. tax
treatment or the U.S. tax structure of the Facility.

To the extent the Operative Documentation for a particular Financing contains provisions regarding the use of
non-public information which conflict with, are more restrictive than or are in addition to the provisions of this
Agreement, then (so long as such Operative Documentation shall be effective as to the Existing Lender) solely
with application to any Evaluation Material concerning the Borrower that is the subject of such Financing (and
without application hereunder to any other Evaluation Material or otherwise), such provisions of the Operative
Documentation shall be incorporated herein by this reference and shall supersede and control the terms of this
Agreement to the extent that such provisions are in conflict with or more restrictive than the terms hereof or are
in addition to those contained herein. Upon the New Lender’s request, the Existing Lender will furnish to the
New Lender the provisions of the Operative Documentation for such Financing regarding the use of non-public
information. In addition, in the event that the New Lender actually becomes a lender (bound as a party to the
Operative Documentation) with respect to a particular Financing, the application of this Agreement in respect of
all Evaluation Material in respect of such Financing shall terminate and the applicable confidentiality provisions,
if any, contained in the Operative Documentation shall govern and control.

If the New Lender in respect of a particular Financing chooses not to participate in such Financing, the New
Lender agrees on request of the Existing Lender to return to the Existing Lender as soon as practical all related
Evaluation Material (other than Internal Evaluation Material) or destroy such Evaluation Material (other than
Internal Evaluation Material) without retaining any copies thereof unless prohibited from doing so by its internal
policies and procedures.

The New Lender in respect of a particular Financing understands and agrees that the Existing Lender will have
received the related Evaluation Material from third party sources (including the Borrower) and that the Existing
Lender bears no responsibility (and shall not be liable) for the accuracy or completeness (or lack thereof) of such
Evaluation Material or any information contained therein.

A-123


-----

The New Lender hereby acknowledges that United States securities laws prohibit any person with material, nonpublic information about an issuer from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer or, subject to certain
limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other person. The New Lender agrees to
comply with its internal compliance policies and procedures with respect to material confidential information.

The New Lender agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for breach of this Agreement, and
that in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, the Existing Lender shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, without proof of actual damages.

This Agreement (including each Schedule delivered pursuant hereto and the provisions of any Operative
Documentation incorporated herein by reference) embodies the entire understanding and agreement between the
parties with respect to all Evaluation Material for each Financing and supersedes all prior understandings and
agreements relating thereto. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties hereto, the application of this
Agreement shall terminate with respect to all Evaluation Material concerning each Financing on the date falling
one year after the Schedule in respect of such Financing.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York,
without regard to principles of conflicts of law (except Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligation Law
to the extent that it mandates that the law of the State of New York govern).

This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, each of which shall be an original and both of which taken
together shall constitute the same instrument.

It is understood by the parties that the custom in the loan syndications and loan trading markets is to execute and
deliver any confidentiality agreement, schedule, confirmation or other transaction documents by telecopy or
telefax. The parties agree that all telecopied or telefaxed copies of this Agreement, the Schedules, confirmations
and other transaction documents, and signatures hereto and thereto, shall be duplicate originals.

**_Trustee has the meaning given to that term in the Indenture._**

2. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, terms defined in the Credit Agreement shall have the same
meaning in this Agreement and a reference to a Clause is a reference to a Clause of the Credit Agreement.
The principles of construction set out in Clause 1.2 (Construction) of the Credit Agreement apply to this
Agreement as though they were set out in full in this Agreement.

3. We refer to Clause 2.2 (Additional Facilities) of the Credit Agreement.

4. This Agreement will take effect on the date on which the Facility Agent notifies UPC Broadband and the
Additional Facility AL Lender that it has received the documents and evidence set out in Schedule 2 to this
Agreement, in each case in form and substance satisfactory to it or, as the case may be, the requirement to
provide any of such documents or evidence has been waived by the Facility Agent on behalf of the
Additional Facility AL Lender (the Effective Date).

5. The Additional Facility AL Lender agrees:

(a) to become a party to and to be bound by the terms of the Credit Agreement as a Lender in accordance
with Clause 2.2 (Additional Facilities) of the Credit Agreement; and

B-2


-----

(b) to become a party to the Security Deed as Lender and to observe, perform and be bound by the terms
and provisions of the Security Deed in the capacity of Lender in accordance with Clause 9.3 (Transfers
by Lenders) of the Security Deed.

6. The Additional Facility Commitment in relation to the Additional Facility AL Lender (for the purpose of the
definition of Additional Facility Commitment in Clause 1.1 (Definitions) of the Credit Agreement) is its
Facility AL Commitment.

7. The Borrower in relation to Facility AL is UPC Financing.

8. (a) Provided that any upsizing of Facility AL permitted under this Clause 8 will not breach any term of the
Credit Agreement, Facility AL may be upsized by any amount, by the signing of one or more further
Additional Facility AL Accession Agreements, that specify (along with the other terms specified therein)
UPC Financing as the sole Borrower and which specify Additional Facility AL Commitments denominated
in dollar, to be drawn in dollar, with the same Final Maturity Date and Margin as specified in this
Additional Facility AL Accession Agreement.

(b) For the purposes of this Clause 8 (unless otherwise specified), references to Facility AL Advances shall
include Advances made under any such further Additional Facility AL Accession Agreement.

(c) Where any Facility AL Advance has not already been consolidated with any other Facility AL
Advance, on the last day of any Interest Period for such Facility AL Advance, that Facility AL
Advance will be consolidated with any other Facility AL Advance which has an Interest Period ending
on the same day as that Facility AL Advance, and all such Facility AL Advances will then be treated as
one Advance.

9. Facility AL may be drawn by one Advance on the date of this Agreement and such date will constitute the
Availability Period for Facility AL. No more than one Request may be made in respect of Facility AL under
the Credit Agreement and such Request may only be in a principal amount of the Additional Facility
Commitment in relation to Facility AL as set out in Clause 6 above.

10. The Facility AL Advance will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital purposes,

including the repayment or prepayment of existing indebtedness.

11. The Final Maturity Date in respect of Facility AL is 15 January, 2025. Any outstanding Advance under

Facility AL shall be repaid in full on the Final Maturity Date.

12. The interest rate for Facility AL will be a fixed rate of 5.375 per cent. per annum. This will be calculated in

accordance with Clause 8.1 (Interest rate) of the Credit Agreement as being the sum of LIBOR, the
applicable Margin and the Mandatory Costs (if applicable), where, in order to achieve the fixed rate referred
to above, the applicable Margin will be, with respect to any Interest Period:

(a) 5.375 per cent. per annum, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months;

minus

(b) the sum of LIBOR plus the Mandatory Costs (if applicable) for such Interest Period.

For the avoidance of doubt, for the purpose of this calculation, the applicable Margin may be a negative

number. Further, the interest rate for Facility AL will never exceed 5.375 per cent. per annum (save to the
extent that Clause 8.8 (Default interest) may apply).

13. Pursuant to Clause 8.2 (Selection of Interest Periods) of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower hereby notifies

the Facility Agent that while the Facility AL Advance is outstanding it selects six months for all Interest
Periods in relation to that Advance.

14. Upon the delivery by the Facility Agent of a notice of cancellation of Facility AL pursuant to

Clause 7.4(a)(v)(B) (Change of Control) of the Credit Agreement following the occurrence of a Change of

B-3


-----

Control (as defined under Clause 7.4 (Change of Control) of the Credit Agreement), UPC Broadband shall
make a payment to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL Lender) in an amount
equal to 1 per cent. of the principal amount of the outstanding Facility AL Advance. Such payment shall be
due and payable by UPC Broadband to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL
Lender) on the actual date of such mandatory prepayment.

15. Subject to Clause 18 of this Agreement, at any time prior to 15 January, 2020, upon the occurrence of any

voluntary prepayment of the Facility AL Advance by UPC Broadband pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary
prepayment) of the Credit Agreement in an amount not to exceed 10% of the original principal amount of
the Facility AL Advance during each twelve-month period commencing on the date of this Agreement, UPC
Broadband shall make a payment to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL
Lender) in an amount (the Prepayment Premium) equal to 3% of the principal amount of the Facility AL
Advance being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest then due on the amount of the Facility AL
Advance prepaid to the due date of prepayment. Such payment shall be due and payable by UPC Broadband
to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL Lender) on the actual date of such
prepayment. Prior to 15 January, 2020, to the extent that during any twelve-month period commencing on
the date of this Agreement, the principal amount of the Facility AL Advance prepaid in any one or more
voluntary prepayments is greater than an amount equal to 10% of the original principal amount of the
Facility AL Advance (any such amount, the Excess Early Redemption Proceeds), UPC Broadband will
apply the Excess Early Redemption Proceeds to a voluntary prepayment of the Facility AL Advance as
described in Clause 16 below.

16. (a) Subject to Clause 18 of this Agreement, at any time prior to 15 January, 2020, upon the occurrence of a

voluntary prepayment of all or any part of the outstanding Facility AL Advance by UPC Broadband
pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of the Credit Agreement with any Excess Early Redemption
Proceeds, UPC Broadband shall make a payment to the Facility Agent (for the account of the Additional
Facility AL Lender) in an amount equal to the Make-Whole Amount (as defined below) (calculated as of a
date no more than three Business Days prior to the date of the relevant Cancellation Notice) as of the due
date of such prepayment. Such payment shall be due and payable by UPC Broadband to the Facility Agent
(for the account of the Additional Facility AL Lender) on the actual date of such prepayment.

For the purposes of this Clause 16:

**Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to Facility AL on any date on which all or any part of the**

outstanding Facility AL Advance is to be prepaid pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of the
Credit Agreement (to the extent of any Excess Early Redemption Proceeds), the excess of:

(i) the present value at such prepayment date of (i) the total amount that would be payable to the Facility
Agent (for the account of the Additional Facility AL Lender) if all or such portion of the outstanding
Facility AL Advance were prepaid pursuant to Clause 7.3 (Voluntary prepayment) of the Credit
Agreement on 15 January, 2020 (including the outstanding principal amount of such Advance and the
Additional Amount (as defined below) required under this Clause 16, but excluding accrued interest
and any other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement in connection with such prepayment) plus
(ii) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due in respect of all or such portion of the
outstanding Facility AL Advance through 15 January, 2020 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest to
the prepayment date), computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate (as defined below) as
of such prepayment date plus 50 basis points; over

(ii) the principal amount of the outstanding Facility AL Advance being prepaid.

**Treasury Rate means, as of any redemption date, the yield to maturity at the time of computation of**
U.S. Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published in the most recent Federal
Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) which has become publicly available at least two Business Days (but
not more than five Business Days) prior to the Redemption Date (or, if such statistical release is not so
published or available, any publicly available source of similar market date selected by the Issuer in good
faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the Redemption Date to 15 January, 2020; provided, however,
that if the period from the Redemption Date to 15 January, 2020 is not equal to the constant maturity of a
U.S. Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by a
linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of
U.S. Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the Redemption Date
to 15 January, 2020 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded U.S. Treasury
securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

prepayment) of the Credit Agreement with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (the

any preferred stock, but excluding any debt securities convertible into such equity.

**Disqualified Stock means, with respect to any person, any Capital Stock of such person which by its**
terms (or by the terms of any security into which it is convertible or for which it is exchangeable) or
upon the happening of any event:

(1) matures or is mandatorily redeemable pursuant to a sinking fund obligation or otherwise;

(2) is convertible or exchangeable for Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock (excluding Capital Stock

or prior to the earlier of the date (a) of the stated maturity of Facility AL or (b) on which there are
no amounts outstanding under Facility AL, provided that only the portion of Capital Stock which
so matures or is mandatorily redeemable, is so convertible or exchangeable or is so redeemable at
the option of the holder thereof prior to such date will be deemed to be Disqualified Stock;
_provided, further that any Capital Stock that would constitute Disqualified Stock solely because_
the holders thereof have the right to require UPC Broadband to repurchase such Capital Stock
upon the occurrence of a change of control or asset sale (each defined in a substantially identical
manner to the corresponding definitions in the Credit Agreement) shall not constitute Disqualified
Stock if the terms of such Capital Stock (and all such securities into which it is convertible or for
which it is ratable or exchangeable) provide that UPC Broadband may not repurchase or redeem
any such Capital Stock (and all such securities into which it is convertible or for which it is ratable
or exchangeable) pursuant to such provision prior to compliance by UPC Broadband with any
provisions of the Credit Agreement.

relevant provisions of the Credit Agreement) to facilitate the discharge of all or part of the Facility AL
Advance in connection with the UPC Exchange Transaction and agree to discuss and negotiate any such
amendments in good faith at the relevant time.

(c) any other amendment, waiver, consent or modification, whether effected by one instrument or through

shall be limited to those that are mechanical in nature unless specifically referenced in Schedule 3
(Amendments, waivers, consents and other modifications) of this Agreement),

consent shall be taken into account in calculating whether the Majority Lenders, or the relevant requisite
Lenders, have consented to the relevant amendments and/or waivers or other modifications to the Finance
Documents in accordance with Clause 25 (Amendments and Waivers) of the Credit Agreement.

22. The Additional Facility AL Lender hereby waives receipt of any fee in connection with the foregoing

consent, notwithstanding that other consenting Lenders under the Credit Facility may be paid a fee in
consideration of such Lenders’ consent to any or all of the foregoing amendments, waivers or other
modifications.

23. In the event that the amendments to the Credit Agreement referred to at paragraph 78 (Benefit of

_Maintenance Covenant) of Schedule 3 (Amendments, waivers, consents and other modifications) become_
effective in accordance with clauses 20 and 21 above, on and from the Amendment Effective Date the
maintenance covenants at Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios) of the Credit Agreement shall not be for the benefit
of the Additional Facility AL Lender and the Additional Facility AL Lender acknowledges and agrees that it
shall not form part of the “Composite Maintenance Covenant Instructing Group” in respect of its Facility
AL Commitment.

24. In the event that the Additional Facility AL Lender is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent) with

respect to any matter (other than the matters specified in Clause 20 above) arising from time to time under
the Credit Agreement or this Agreement the Facility Agent will apply the votes of the Additional Facility
AL Lender in accordance with a written direction to be provided by the Additional Facility AL Lender or
the Trustee (on behalf of the Additional Facility AL Lender). The Additional Facility AL Lender agrees that
it will give any such direction in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.01 of the Indenture. For the

any agreement or instrument to which UPC Holding is a party or binding upon UPC Holding or any member
of the Borrower Group or any assets of UPC Holding or any member of the Borrower Group’s assets, where
such violation would or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

27. The Additional Facility AL Lender confirms to each Finance Party that:

(a) it has made its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of
each Obligor and its related entities in connection with its participation in the Credit Agreement and
has not relied on any information provided to it by a Finance Party in connection with any Finance
Document; and

(b) it will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its
related entities while any amount is or may be outstanding under the Credit Agreement or any
Additional Facility Commitment is in force.

28. The Additional Facility AL Lender agrees to waive the notice period in respect of delivery of drawdown

requests under Clause 5.1 (Delivery of Request) of the Credit Agreement in respect of Facility AL. The
Additional Facility AL Lender, the Borrower and the Facility Agent acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Facility AL Advance shall be made by the Additional Facility AL Lender directly to the Borrower to an
account notified by the Borrower to the Additional Facility AL Lender, rather than through the Facility
Agent, and (b) in respect of any other payments of principal, interest or other amounts due under Facility
AL, (i) the Borrower shall make payments payable by it to the Additional Facility AL Lender directly to the
Additional Facility AL Lender (or to such account as the Additional Facility AL Lender may specify), and

request by that Finance Party.

32. This Agreement and any non contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by

counterparts. Each counterpart is an original, but all counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart signature page of this Agreement by e-mail (PDF) or
telecopy shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. In relation
to each counterpart, upon confirmation by or on behalf of the signatory that the signatory authorises the
attachment of such counterpart signature page to the final text of this Agreement, such counterpart signature
page shall take effect together with such final text as a complete authoritative counterpart.

34. For purposes of any assignment, transfer or novation of rights and/or obligations (in whole or in part) by a

Lender in respect of Facility AL under Clause 26.2 (Transfers by Lenders) of the Credit Agreement, UPC
Broadband hereby consents to any assignment, transfer or novation made by the Additional Facility AL
Lender (including any subsequent Lender under Facility AL) following an Event of Default (as defined in
the Indenture), provided that any such assignment, transfer or novation in part shall be in a minimum
amount of US$200,000. The Additional Facility AL Lender may only deliver to the Facility Agent a
completed assignment or transfer document or Novation Certificate (as applicable) if at that time it confirms
to the Facility Agent in writing that such assignment, transfer or novation is not prohibited under the terms
of any agreement that is binding on it or any of its assets.

-----

58. Impaired Agent: amend the Credit Agreement to provide for impaired agent provisions language used in

recent Liberty precedent and/or, to the extent not inconsistent with recent Liberty precedent, the European
leverage loan market so that alternative payment and notice arrangements are permitted if the Facility Agent
is impaired.

59. Defaulting Lender: include standard defaulting lender provisions used in recent Liberty precedent and/or,

to the extent not inconsistent with recent Liberty precedent, the European leverage loan market so as the
commitments of a defaulting lender may be cancelled and it will have no rights to vote in respect of such
cancelled commitments. Clarify that no commitment fee will be payable to a defaulting lender.

60. Replacement of Agent/Security Agent: amend Clause 19.14 (Resignation of Agents), in accordance with

recent Liberty precedent, to:

(a) remove the requirements for UPC Broadband to: (a) be unsatisfied with the performance of the Agent;
(b) specify reasonable grounds for replacement in the relevant notice and (c) add a requirement that no
Default is outstanding at the relevant time;

(b) provide that UPC Broadband may remove the Facility Agent if the status or identity of the Facility
Agent causes any Obligor to become liable for any withholding tax in connection with FATCA; and

(c) provide that UPC Broadband will have the right to appoint a successor Facility Agent without the
Lenders’ consent twice during the life of the Facilities,

and, in each case, permits the removal of the Security Agent as the joint creditor for the purposes of
any “parallel debt”.

61. Assignments / Transfers of Lenders: clarify that the Borrower should have the right to withhold consent in

respect of an assignment/transfer of any revolving credit facility to an entity which is not a lender under a
revolving facility to the wider Liberty group (subject to no consent being required in the case of transfers to
other Lenders or affiliates of Lenders or following an event of default which is continuing). There should be
no unreasonableness or delay qualifier on this right (in respect of any revolving credit facility only) and no
deemed consent concept.

62. Replacement of a Lender: amend the Credit Agreement to include the right to replace a Lender (in whole

and at par) if the Obligor becomes obliged to make payment under Illegality, Increased Costs, Tax Gross up
or Tax Indemnity provisions to any Lender, if a Lender invokes the provisions of Clause 11.2 (Market
_Disruption) or if a Lender is a defaulting lender._

63. Expenses: amend Clause 21.2 (Amendment costs) to make legal fees subject to any agreed caps; and Clause

22 (Stamp Duties) to ensure that any liability of the Borrower for the payment of any tax (including stamp
taxes) does not extend to taxes payable in respect of an assignment or transfer of a Lender’s interest.

64. Amendments:

(a) amend Clause 25 (Amendments and waivers) to introduce a class exception, whereby any amendment
or waiver that relates only to the rights or obligations of a particular utilisation or Facility and does not
materially and adversely affect the rights or interests of Lenders in respect of other utilisations or
Facilities only requires the consent of the relevant proportion of Lenders participating in such
Utilisation or Facility;

(b) amend Clause 25.2 (Exceptions) to require the consent of affected Lenders only and not all Lenders
(and make any consequential changes by amending for example, all references to matters requiring all
Lender consent to only requiring affected Lender consent);

(c) include a new paragraph (e) to Clause 25.2 (Exceptions), to permit the Facility Agent to make
technical, minor, operational and OID amendments without consent from any Lenders, on terms
consistent with recent Liberty precedent as at the date of implementation of the amendments;

(d) include a new clause 25.5 (Calculation of Consent), such that where a request for a waiver of, or an
amendment to, any provision of any Finance Document has been sent by the Facility Agent to the
Lenders at the request of an Obligor, each Lender that does not respond to such request for waiver or
amendment within 10 Business Days after receipt by it of such request (or within such other period as
the Facility Agent and UPC Broadband shall specify), shall be excluded from the calculation in
determining whether the requisite level of consent to such waiver or amendment was granted; and

B-27


-----

(e) include a new paragraph (f) of Clause 25.2 (Exceptions) such that the release of guarantees and security
under the Finance Documents (and not in accordance with the Finance Documents) requires the
consent of affected Lenders whose undrawn Commitments and participations are greater than 90 per
cent. of all undrawn Commitments and participations and delete paragraph (a)(x) of Clause 25.2
(Exceptions).

65. Covenant Compliance: disapply Clause 4.3 (Pro forma covenant compliance) so that there is no drawstop

if the financial covenants would not be complied with in relation to a rollover of a revolving credit facility
Advance or the redrawing of a term Advance.

66. Indemnification requirements: amend the Credit Agreement in respect of any indemnity granted by the

Borrower to conform to recent Liberty precedent including, amongst others, amending Clause 10.3 (Tax
_Indemnity) such that the indemnity is paid within 10 Business Days and the loss is calculated on a_
reasonable basis.

67. Non-consenting Lenders: include a provision whereby if 80 per cent. of affected Lenders have consented

to a request for an amendment or waiver, UPC Broadband may elect to replace any Lender that has not
consented to such request by procuring that its relevant Commitments are acquired at par in accordance with
the provisions in recent Liberty precedent.

68. References: amend the Credit Agreement:

(a) so that all references to any party include any assignees, transferees, successors in title and merged
entities thereof; and

(b) to take account of the fact that certain Facilities under the Credit Facility have been (as at the date of
this Agreement) repaid and cancelled in full.

69. Subsidiary: amend the definition of Subsidiary so that for the purposes of the financial covenants and

related provisions that a “Subsidiary” of a person includes legal entity which is accounted for under
applicable GAAP or IFRS as a Subsidiary.

70. Material Adverse Effect: amend definition of Material Adverse Effect so that it relates only to payment

obligations and not “other material obligations”.

71. Certain Funds Acquisitions: amend Clause 4.2 (Further Conditions Precedent) to provide that the relevant

Additional Facility Lenders may amend or waive any of the conditions at paragraphs (a) and (b) in relation
to any Advance under an Additional Facility in relation to an acquisition where the relevant vendor requires,
or it is commercially advantageous in connection with any competitive bid process that, such acquisition is
completed on a certain funds basis other than an Event of Default that has arisen under Clause 18.2 (Non_payment) or Clauses 18.6 (Insolvency) to 18.10 (Similar proceedings)._

72. Calculation of EURIBOR/LIBOR: amend the Credit Agreement to include provisions for the calculation

of EURIBOR/LIBOR in accordance with recent Liberty precedent and/or, to the extent not inconsistent with
recent Liberty precedent, the European leverage loan market provided that in no circumstances will
EURIBOR/LIBOR be deemed to be zero and to include a requirement for the Facility Agent to notify the
relevant Borrower of each funding rate.

73. Voluntary cancellation/prepayment: amend clauses 7.2 (Voluntary cancellation) and 7.3 (Voluntary

_prepayment) to delete the references to delivering to the Facility Agent a duly completed Cancellation_
Notice not less than “five” Business Days prior to the due date of the cancellation/prepayment and replace it
with a reference to not less than “three” Business Days or such other time period agreed between UPC
Broadband and the Facility Agent prior to the due date of the cancellation/prepayment.

74. Deferred Acquisition Costs: amend the thresholds in clause 4.4 (Deferred Acquisition Costs) such that the

reference to €100,000,000 is replaced with a reference to €250,000,000 and the references to €150,000,000
are replaced with references to €300,000,000.

75. Additional Facility Accession Agreement: amend the Additional Facility Accession Agreement definition

to delete the reference to “with such amendments as the Facility Agent may approve or reasonably require”
and replace it with a reference to “with such amendments as may be agreed between UPC Broadband and
the relevant Lender or Lenders under the proposed Additional Facility”.

B-28


-----

76. Guarantor Coverage: replace the reference to “95%” at paragraph (b)(i)(B) of Clause 26.4 (Additional

_Obligors) with a reference to “80%” and at paragraph (b)(i)(A) of Clause 26.4 (Additional Obligors) replace_
“the Guarantors as of the Effective Date (other than UPC Broadband, any UPC Broadband Holdco, UPC
Holding and UPC Holding II) and their respective Subsidiaries” with “the Guarantors as of the Effective
Date (other than UPC Broadband, any UPC Broadband Holdco, UPC Holding, UPC Holding II and any
Subsidiary of UPC Broadband that is a Holding Company of all other Subsidiaries of UPC Broadband) and
their respective Subsidiaries”.

77. UGCE Borrower Group: amend the definition of UGCE Borrower Group so that it refers to UPC Holding

and any other company of which UPC Broadband is a Subsidiary and which is a Subsidiary of UPC
Holding.

78. Benefit of Maintenance Covenant: amend the Credit Agreement to provide that:

(a) the maintenance covenants at Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios) shall only be for the benefit of those
Lenders under Additional Facilities that (i) are stated to have the benefit of such maintenance
covenants or (ii) do not contain a statement that they do not have the benefit of such maintenance
covenants, in each case, in the relevant Additional Facility Accession Agreement;

(b) a new definition of “Composite Maintenance Covenant Instructing Group” is included which shall
consist of a Lender or Lenders whose Additional Facility Commitments in respect of Additional
Facilities that benefit from the maintenance covenants at Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios) amount in
aggregate to more than 50% of the total Additional Facility Commitments in respect of Additional
Facilities that benefit from the maintenance covenants calculated in accordance with the new clause
25.5 (Calculation of Consent) (as referred to in paragraph 64(d) of this Schedule) and not taking into
account Commitments in respect of which a cancellation notice has been issued;

(c) following a breach of Clause 17.2 (Financial ratios), subject to the expiry of the cure period in
accordance with Clause 17.4 (Cure provisions), (i) the Facility Agent shall, if instructed by the
Composite Maintenance Covenant Instructing Group, take acceleration action in respect of the
Additional Facilities and Commitments held by Lenders in the Composite Maintenance Covenant
Instructing Group in accordance with recent Liberty precedent, (ii) there shall be a drawstop in relation
to future Advances and (iii) there shall be an Event of Default continuing for the purposes of the
operative covenants e.g. paragraph 52(a)(v) above;

(d) an Event of Default will be triggered if the Composite Maintenance Covenant Instructing Group give a
direction to the Facility Agent in accordance with the new acceleration clause at (c) above; and

(e) amendments and waivers of Clauses 17.2 (Financial ratios) to 17.4 (Cure provisions) and the new
acceleration clause at (c) above shall only be made with the consent of UPC Broadband and the
Composite Maintenance Covenant Instructing Group and shall not require the consent of any other
Finance Party.

**2.2 Open Market Purchases of UPCB Loans**

Neither the Company nor UPC Financing will, and the Company will procure that none of UPC

Holding or any of its other subsidiaries will, make any offer to purchase or otherwise acquire any UPCB
Loans (whether through a tender offer process or other process) if such offer is at a price below the relevant
prevailing market price for such UPCB Loans and includes all or a portion of either Finco Loan held by the
Issuer, unless (i) the Issuer makes a contemporaneous offer to purchase the applicable Notes on substantially
similar terms as the offer to purchase such UPCB Loans and (ii) the consideration offered to holders of the
Notes is not less than the consideration they would have received as UPCB Lenders in connection with such
offer to purchase UPCB Loans.

**2.3 Minimum Period for Consents under the Loan Documents**

In the event that the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, is eligible or required to vote (or otherwise consent)

with respect to any request by any member of the UPCB Group for any waiver, amendment or supplement
to any UPCB Loan Document or any other determination to be made by the UPCB Lenders, other than with
respect to the Required Consent Provisions, each of the Company and UPC Financing agrees, and the
Company agrees to procure that each other member of the UPCB Group agrees, that the period during
which the Issuer, as a UPCB Lender, will be eligible or required to validly vote (or otherwise consent) with
respect to any such waiver, amendment, supplement or determination will not be less than 15 Business Days
from the date such request is first made to the UPCB Lenders. The Company will distribute, or cause to be
distributed, to Holders and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note, or otherwise make available
(including through the facilities of The Depositary Trust Company, Euroclear and Clearstream or via an
Internet web site or an electronic information provider) all documents related to any such waiver,
amendment, supplement or other determination, including all documentation necessary to enable the
Holders to vote in the manner set forth in Article 9 (Amendment, Supplement and Waiver) of the Indenture,
within three Business Days after the date the request is first made to the UPCB Lenders.

**2.4 Payment for Consents**

Neither the Company nor UPC Financing will, and the Company will procure that no other member of

the UPCB Group will, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit
of any UPCB Lender for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment under any UPCB Loan
Document that is subject to the consent of Majority Lenders or all UPCB Lenders, other than the Required
Consent Provisions, unless (i) such consideration is offered to be paid to the Issuer (as a UPCB Lender) in
respect of the Finco Loans and (ii) if the Issuer consents, waives or agrees to such consent, waiver or
amendment in accordance with Article 9 (Amendment, Supplement and Waiver) of the Indenture in the time
frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating thereto (including any amendment or supplement
thereto), the Issuer is paid such consideration.

**2.5 Amendments to Loan Documents to be applied equally to all UPCB Lenders**

Neither the Company nor UPC Financing will, and the Company will procure that no member of the

UPCB Group will, amend, waive or supplement any UPCB Loan Document requiring the consent of
Majority Lenders or all UPCB Lenders to amend, waive or supplement, unless such amendment, waiver or
supplement applies on equal terms to all UPCB Lenders; provided, this Clause 2.6 will not apply to (a) any
such amendment, waiver or supplement that does not adversely affect the rights of the Issuer or the Holders
in any material respect, (b) any such amendment, waiver or supplement consented to by Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes in compliance with Article 9
(Amendment, Supplement and Waiver) of the Indenture as if such amendment, waiver or supplement were
subject to the majority consent provisions described therein or (c) any such amendment, waiver or
supplement that has been consented to by the requisite UPCB Lenders (as determined in accordance with
the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility), including the Issuer, but irrespective of whether the Issuer,
acting on instructions of the Holders in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, has voted in favour of
the amendment, waiver, consent or supplement.

**2.6 Information**

In the event the Company supplies any report or other information pursuant to the provisions of the

UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility to “public” UPCB Lenders, it shall provide any such report or other
information to Holders and all holders of Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note via an Internet web site or

C-5

an electronic information provider (and the Company shall ensure that the Holders and holders of BookEntry Interests have access to such website or electronic information provider) at the same time as other
“public” UPCB Lenders.

The Company will promptly notify the Issuer, the Trustee, the Holders and the holders of Book-Entry

Interest in the Notes of any default (or other event that would constitute or would be reasonably likely to
result in a default) under this Agreement, the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility, the Finco Accession
Agreements, the Fee Letter or the UPC Expenses Agreement.

**3.** **COMPANY’S AND UPC FINANCING’S LIABILITY**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Indenture, the liability of the Company

and UPC Financing under this Agreement at any time and from time to time shall be limited to the
aggregate amount owing to the Issuer under and in connection with the UPC Broadband Holding Bank
Facility and any other UPCB Loan Document plus any costs of enforcement.

**4.** **ISSUER’S LIABILITY**

(a) Each of the Company and UPC Financing acknowledges and agrees that its rights against the Issuer
under this Agreement are limited to the extent that it will not take any action or commence any
proceedings against the Issuer to recover any amounts due and payable by the Issuer to it under this
Agreement except as expressly permitted by the provisions of this Agreement. Each of the Company
and UPC Financing further agrees that it will not take any action or commence any proceedings or
petition a court for the liquidation or winding up of the Issuer, nor enter into any arrangement,
reorganisation or insolvency proceedings in relation to the Issuer whether under the laws of the
Cayman Islands or other applicable bankruptcy laws.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of the Issuer to each
of the Company and UPC Financing under this Agreement shall be limited to the lesser of (a) the
nominal amount of the claim of the Company or (as the case may be) UPC Financing (the “Claim
**Amount”) determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (other than this clause) (the**
“Claim”); and (b) the product of (i) the Net Proceeds (as defined below) divided by the aggregate of
the Claim Amount and all of the obligations of the Issuer ranking pari passu with the Claim and (ii) the
Claim Amount. In this clause, “Net Proceeds” means the net proceeds of realisation of all of the assets
of the Issuer other than any assets subject to a mortgage, charge, assignment or pledge in favour of the
Security Agent, the proceeds of the issued ordinary share capital of the Issuer and any transaction fees
charged by the Issuer in respect of the issuance of the Notes and Additional Notes and any interest
earned thereon after payment of, or provision for, all of the Issuer’s debts, costs, expenses and other
obligations of the Issuer determined by its directors in their absolute discretion other than the Claim
and any obligations ranking pari passu with or behind the Claim. If there are no Net Proceeds, any
outstanding debt shall be extinguished and the Issuer shall have no obligations to the Company or (as
the case may be) UPC Financing under this Agreement.

(c) Each of the Company and UPC Financing acknowledges and agrees that the Issuer’s obligations under
this Agreement are solely its corporate obligations, and that each of the Company and UPC Financing
shall not have any recourse against any of the Issuer’s directors, officers or employees for any claims,
losses, damages, liabilities, indemnities or other obligations whatsoever in connection with any
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) This Section 4 shall survive termination for any reason whatsoever of this Agreement.

**5.** **COSTS AND EXPENSES**

The Company shall within 10 Business Days of demand pay the Issuer the amount of all costs and

expenses (including legal fees) reasonably incurred by it in connection with:

(a) the negotiation, preparation, printing, execution and syndication of this Agreement;

(b) the administration of this Agreement; and

C-6


-----

(c) the failure by the Company or UPC Financing to perform or comply with its obligations under this
Agreement.

**6.** **ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER**

# UPC Holding Reports Preliminary Q1 2015 Results

## Revenue Growth Driven by Solid Swiss/Austrian Performance

 Continued Focus on High-Value Product Offerings Across UPC Footprint

##### UPC Holding B.V ("UPC Holding") connects people to the digital world and enables them to discover and experience its endless possibilities. Our market-leading triple-play services are provided through next- generation networks and innovative technology platforms in seven countries that connected 6.7 million customers subscribing to 12.2 million television, broadband internet and telephony services at Q1 2015.

 Operating and financial highlights*:

### • Q1 RGU performance adversely impacted by competition and price increases

##### ARPU[17] per customer up 3% on an FX-neutral[35] basis, including 6% at Switzerland
 Added 23,000 RGUs[2], including 9,000 in Switzerland/Austria

 Successful implementation of price increases in Switzerland, Austria and Hungary

 Central and Eastern European ("CEE") RGU growth below Q1 2014 level, mainly due to lower telephony growth, partially offset by better RGU performance in the Czech Republic

### • Offering high-value bundles with top speeds between 240 and 500 Mbps across our 7 markets

##### Another strong quarter for Horizon with 34,000 new subscribers in Q1

 In April, expanded Horizon TV triple-play bundles including MyPrime to the Czech Republic following launch of Horizon Go in November 2014

 Multi-screen service Horizon Go now in 6 out of 7 markets, offering out-of-home capabilities

 Increased WiFiSpots to 1.8 million and started Czech Republic WiFi trial in April

 Began offering all new acquisition bundles in Switzerland at higher price points in March

### • Swiss/Austrian integration continues to streamline operations; up to 250 employee redundancies
##### expected through 2018

### • Rebased[3] revenue up 3%, driven by a 4% increase in our Swiss/Austrian operation

 • Rebased Segment OCF[6] declined 1%, primarily due to a Q1 2014 accrual release in Poland and an
##### increase in recurring VAT payments in our DTH operation that took effect on January 1, 2015

 Our Swiss/Austrian business delivered 3% rebased Segment OCF growth in Q1

### • Property and equipment additions[8] were 15% of revenue, down 340 basis points year-over-year

 • Restructured UPC credit pool during Q1 with the extractions of UPC Ireland in February and UPC
##### Nederland in early March

- The financial figures contained in this release are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP[37]. During the first quarter of 2015, Liberty Global completed certain internal

reorganizations of its broadband and wireless communications businesses in Europe that resulted in the transfer of (i) UPC Broadband Ireland Ltd. ("UPC Ireland")
and its subsidiaries, (ii) UPC Nederland B.V. ("UPC Nederland") and its subsidiaries and (iii) certain entities (the "Corporate Entities") from our company to certain
other Liberty Global subsidiaries outside of UPC Holding (collectively, the "Common Control Transfers"). The Corporate Entities incur central and other administrative
costs that are allocated to Liberty Global’s operating subsidiaries, including UPC Holding following the transfer of the Corporate Entities. We have accounted for the
Common Control Transfers at carryover basis and the financial information and operating statistics presented herein have been retrospectively revised to give effect
to these transactions for all periods presented.

### Subscriber Statistics

##### During the past several quarters, we have continued to make substantial investments in product development and our superior network in order to differentiate and deliver innovative products, including superfast broadband, Horizon TV, WiFi and MyPrime to our customers. In order to harvest the investments we have made in our superior products and network, we implemented price increases in the majority of our markets in Q1 2015. Partly due to elevated churn and continued competitive environments across the footprint, we added 23,000 organic RGUs in the first quarter as compared to 74,000 in Q1 2014. With half of our 6.7 million customer base still subscribing to only one product, our strategy remains to upsell our bundled fixed- line services, as well as mobile products, to these customers. Our total ARPU per customer increased 3% in Q1 on an FX-neutral basis, as compared to Q1 2014, led by our Swiss operation with a 6% FX-neutral growth rate over the same prior-year period.

 On the video front, our Q1 attrition of 41,000 RGUs was 10,000 higher than in the prior year period. The increased video losses were mainly driven by a weaker performance in our Swiss business due to a difficult comparison, as Q1 2014 was positively impacted by the introduction of digital products in the Geneva region. Our multi-screen service Horizon Go with in- and out-of-home content capabilities is now live in six countries with Slovakia to follow in Q2. The momentum of Horizon TV, our next-generation video platform, continued as we added 34,000 new subscribers, including 21,000 additions in Poland. Our subscription-based video- on-demand service MyPrime is resonating well with our customers as we see continued high usage in Switzerland and promising initial demand in Hungary and Poland, where we just launched it in late 2014.

 Broadband internet remains the key source of our organic subscriber additions. Driven by our superior networks, we added 42,000 broadband RGUs in Q1 2015. Whereas our Swiss/Austrian operation delivered broadband additions broadly in line with the prior year period, our CEE operation experienced lower additions, mainly in Poland due to selective broadband price increases and fierce competition. At the same time, our fixed-line telephony RGU additions of 22,000 in Q1 also declined on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by lower triple-play take-up in our CEE region, mainly due to improved performance of our double-play video and broadband internet bundles in Romania and Hungary. In terms of mobile, we added 9,000 subscribers in Q1, including 6,000 in Switzerland. Of note, over half of our Swiss additions opted for our mid-tier mobile product. During Q4 2014, we launched full-MVNO mobile offerings on a controlled basis in Austria and Hungary, but related marketing campaigns have not yet been initiated.

### Financial Summary

##### Total revenue increased 3% on a rebased basis to €628 million. This increase is attributable to revenue growth in our Swiss/Austrian segment and, to a lesser extent, CEE operations. The increase in our Swiss/ Austrian segment was driven primarily by our Swiss operation, which generated 5% rebased revenue growth. Switzerland’s revenue increase is primarily attributable to increases in (i) cable subscription revenue, driven by higher ARPU and growth in subscribers, and (ii) B2B revenue. The increase at our CEE operation was primarily driven by subscriber growth during the last twelve months in Hungary, Romania and Poland that was only partially offset by a decrease in ARPU at UPC DTH related to the aforementioned change in VAT. We posted total Segment OCF of €326 million, representing a 1% year-over-year rebased decline. Our Swiss/Austrian business reported 3% rebased Segment OCF growth, as compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of the aforementioned revenue increase, which was only partially offset by increases in operating and SG&A expenses. Our CEE operations reported a 9% decline in rebased Segment OCF compared to the prior year period. This decrease includes the impact of the aforementioned revenue drivers and the negative impact of a €5 million favorable nonrecurring settlement recorded in Poland during Q1 2014. Our property and equipment additions were 15% of revenue in Q1 2015, as compared to 19% in the respective prior year period. This decline was mainly related to a reduced inventory build-up of our centrally- procured customer premises equipment.

##### On April 15, 2015, we issued new senior secured notes with principal amounts of $800 million (€746 million) and €600 million due 2025 and 2027, yielding 5.375% and 4.0%, respectively. The net proceeds were used to redeem (i) the remaining €190 million of principal amount of our 6.375% EUR senior secured notes due 2020, (ii) the outstanding $1 billion (€0.9 billion) principal amount of our 6.625% USD senior secured notes due 2020, (iii) 10% of certain of our other senior secured notes and (iv) the outstanding amount under Facility AI, including related premiums and transaction fees.

 At March 31, 2015, our fully-swapped third-party debt borrowing cost[24] improved to 5.8%, as compared to 8.0% at Q1 2014, and the average tenor of our third-party debt is now approximately 6.5 years. Based on the results for Q1 2015, and subject to the completion of our Q1 2015 compliance reporting requirements, the ratio of Senior Net Debt to Annualized EBITDA (last two quarters annualized) was 3.08x and (ii) the ratio of Net Total Debt to Annualized EBITDA (last two quarters annualized) was 4.26x, in each case, calculated in accordance with the UPC Broadband Holding Bank Facility. As of March 31, 2015, we had maximum undrawn commitments of €846 million. When the March 31, 2015 compliance reporting requirements are completed, we anticipate €770 million will be available.

2 Revenue Generating Unit ("RGU") is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, DTH Subscriber, MMDS Subscriber,
Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs.
For example, if a residential customer in our Austrian system subscribed to our enhanced video service, telephony service and broadband
internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, DTH, MMDS, Internet
and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than
one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g. a primary home and a
vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a
separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their
free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without
charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers, free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include
subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our March 31, 2015 RGU counts exclude our separately
reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

3 For purposes of calculating rebased growth rates on a comparable basis, we have adjusted the historical revenue and Segment OCF for the
three months ended March 31, 2014 of the applicable borrowing groups to include the pre-acquisition revenue and Segment OCF of certain
entities acquired during 2014 and 2015 (one small entity in the UPC Holding borrowing group) in our rebased amounts for the three months
ended March 31, 2014 to the same extent that the revenue and Segment OCF of such entities are included in our results for the three months
ended March 31, 2015 and reflect the translation of our rebased amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2014 at the applicable average
foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate our results for the three months ended March 31, 2015. For further information
on the calculation of rebased growth rates, see the discussion in Revenue and Operating Cash Flow in Liberty Global's press release dated
May 7, 2015, Liberty Global Reports First Quarter 2015 Results.

6 Segment OCF is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker and management to evaluate the operating performance
of our businesses. Segment OCF is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources
and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term,
Segment OCF is defined as revenue less operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses (excluding share-based
compensation, related-party fees and allocations, depreciation and amortization, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation
and impairment, restructuring and other operating items). Other operating items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived
assets, (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and
due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration.
As further described in footnote 21 below, certain related-party fees and allocations are included in the calculation of the “EBITDA” metric
specified by the applicable debt agreements of Liberty Global’s subsidiaries. Our internal decision makers believe operating cash flow is a
meaningful measure and is superior to available U.S. GAAP measures because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating
performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to (1) readily view operating trends, (2) perform analytical
comparisons and benchmarking between entities and (3) identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which
we operate. We believe our operating cash flow measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance
with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar
measures used by other public companies. Segment OCF should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to,
and not a substitute for, operating income, net earnings or loss, cash flow from operating activities and other U.S. GAAP measures of income
or cash flows. A reconciliation of Segment OCF to operating income is presented in the applicable sections of this release.

7 Omitted.

8 Property and equipment additions include capital expenditures on an accrual basis, amounts financed under vendor financing or capital lease
arrangements and other non-cash additions.

9 Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially
extending the distribution plant, except for DTH and Multi-channel Multipoint (“microwave”) Distribution System (“MMDS”) homes. Our Homes
Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count
homes passed for DTH. With respect to countries that offer MMDS, one MMDS customer is equal to one Home Passed. Due to the fact that
we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks.

10 Two-way Homes Passed are Homes Passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services,
including video, internet and telephony services.

11 Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband
network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use
of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we
use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an EBU basis, we count RGUs on a unique
premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes
and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. At UPC Holding, we have approximately 110,600 “lifeline”
customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few
channels. During the first quarter of 2015, we modified certain video subscriber definitions to better align these definitions with the underlying
services received by our subscribers and have replaced our “Digital Cable” and “Analog Cable” subscriber definitions with “Enhanced Video”
and “Basic Video,” respectively. In connection with the implementation of the new definitions, we reclassified 916,900 Enhanced Video

12 Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband
network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of
encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted on a unique premises basis.
For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one
subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video
services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers to
enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks receive basic video services from the partner networks
as opposed to our operations. During the first quarter of 2015, we modified certain video subscriber definitions to better align these definitions
with the underlying services received by our subscribers and have replaced our “Digital Cable” and “Analog Cable” subscriber definitions with
“Enhanced Video” and “Basic Video,” respectively.

13 MMDS Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming via MMDS.

14 Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that
we service through a partner network. Our Internet Subscribers exclude 65,900 digital subscriber line (“DSL”) subscribers within Austria that
are not serviced over our networks. Our Internet Subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections. In
Switzerland, we offer a 2 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet
Subscribers in Switzerland include 66,800 subscribers who have requested and received this service.

15 Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that
we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. Our Telephony Subscribers exclude
48,400 subscribers within Austria that are not serviced over our networks. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and
Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 21,400 subscribers who
have requested and received this service.

16 Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as
Revenue Generating Units (“RGUs”), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include
equivalent billing unit (“EBU”) adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our Customer Relationship counts. For further information
regarding our EBU calculation, see Additional General Notes to Tables. Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises
basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally
will count as two Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Customer Relationships.

17 Average Revenue Per Unit (“ARPU”) refers to the average monthly subscription revenue per average customer relationship and is calculated
by dividing the average monthly subscription revenue (excluding mobile services, B2B services, interconnect, channel carriage fees, mobile
handset sales and installation fees) for the indicated period, by the average of the opening and closing balances for customer relationships
for the period. Customer relationships of entities acquired during the period are normalized. Unless otherwise indicated, ARPU per customer
relationship is not adjusted for currency impacts.

18 Omitted.

19 Our mobile subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (“SIM”) cards in service rather than services
provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber.
Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted
as two mobile subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after
periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country.

20 Omitted.

21 During the first quarter of 2015, Liberty Global transferred certain entities that incur central and other administrative costs (the “Corporate
Entities Transfer”) from UPC Holding B.V. to certain other Liberty Global subsidiaries that are outside of Liberty Global’s borrowing groups.  In
connection with the Corporate Entities Transfer, Liberty Global changed the processes it uses to charge fees and allocate costs and expenses
from one subsidiary to another, which, as further described below, impact the calculation of the “EBITDA” metric specified by the applicable
debt agreements of Liberty Global’s subsidiaries. This new methodology (the “2015 Liberty Global Allocation Methodology”) is intended to
ensure that Liberty Global continues to allocate its central and administrative costs to its borrowing groups on a fair and rational basis. Subject
to the specific terms contained in the debt agreements of Liberty Global’s subsidiaries, the implementation of the 2015 Liberty Global Allocation
Methodology impacts the calculation of the EBITDA metric for each of Liberty Global’s subsidiary borrowing groups. In this regard, the
components of related-party fees and allocations that are deducted to arrive at each EBITDA metric in 2015 and future periods are based on
(i) the amount and nature of costs incurred by the allocating Liberty Global subsidiaries during the period, (ii) the allocation methodologies in
effect during the period and (iii) the size of the overall pool of entities that are charged fees and allocated costs, such that changes in any of
these factors would likely result in changes to the amount of related-party fees and allocations that will be deducted to arrive at each EBITDA
metric in future periods. For example, to the extent that a Liberty Global subsidiary borrowing group was to acquire (sell) an operating entity,
and assuming no change in the total costs incurred by the allocating entities, the fees charged and the costs allocated to the other subsidiary
borrowing groups would decrease (increase).

22 The capital expenditures that we report in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed
under vendor financing or capital lease arrangements. Instead, these expenditures are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and
equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the related principal is repaid.

23 Net third-party debt including capital or finance lease obligations (as applicable) is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP or EU-IFRS and may
not therefore be comparable with other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

24 Our fully-swapped third-party debt borrowing cost represents the weighted average interest rate on our aggregate variable and fixed rate
indebtedness (excluding capital lease or finance lease obligations, respectively), including the effects of derivative instruments, original issue
premiums or discounts and commitment fees, but excluding the impact of financing costs.

25 DTH Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via a
geosynchronous satellite.

26 Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers enhanced video, broadband internet and telephony services over networks owned by thirdparty cable operators (“partner networks”). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer.
At March 31, 2015, Switzerland’s partner networks account for 141,300 Customer Relationships, 282,000 RGUs, 112,100 Enhanced Video
Subscribers, 99,300 Internet Subscribers, and 70,600 Telephony Subscribers.

27 Enhanced video penetration is calculated by dividing the number of enhanced video RGUs by the total number of total video RGUs.

28 Telephony and broadband penetration is calculated by dividing the number of telephony RGUs and broadband RGUs, respectively, by the total
two-way homes passed.

35 The FX-neutral change in ARPU represents the percentage change on a year-over-year basis adjusted for FX impacts and is calculated by
adjusting the prior year figures to reflect translation at the foreign currency rates used to translate the current year amounts.

36 Amounts represent the net impact of changes in inventory levels associated with centrally-procured customer premises equipment. This
equipment is ultimately transferred to certain Liberty Global European operating subsidiaries, including subsidiaries within UPC Holding.

37 Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Additional General Notes:

Organic figures exclude RGUs of acquired entities at the date of acquisition, but include the impact of changes in RGUs from the date of acquisition.
All subscriber/RGU additions or losses refer to net organic changes, unless otherwise noted.

All of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other business-to-business (“B2B”) services.
Certain of our B2B revenue is derived from small or home office (“SOHO”) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels
along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers.
All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in
the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices
considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers.” With the exception of our B2B SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of
B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.

Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and commercial
establishments, such as certain commercial and residential multiple dwelling units in Europe. Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the
bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable
tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates.

While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet
date, the variability from country to country in (i) the nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems,
(iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber
counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we
may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews.

Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and
determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.
