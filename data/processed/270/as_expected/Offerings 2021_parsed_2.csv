270_2,Offerings 2021.md,1661,DEFINITIONS AND CURRENCY PRESENTATION,1661.6,Other Financial Measures,1661.6.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum and the information incorporated by reference herein, we present “Segment Adjusted EBITDA”, which is not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance and is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to (i) determine how to allocate resources to segments and (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of annual and other incentive compensation plans. As we use the term, “Segment Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before net income tax benefit (expense), other non-operating income or expense, net gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, net foreign currency gains (losses), net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, related-party fees and allocations, provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment, restructuring and other operating items. Other operating items include (a) gains and losses on the disposition of long-lived assets, xiii ----- (b) third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions, including legal, advisory and due diligence fees, as applicable, and (c) other acquisition-related items, such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which we believe is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating trends from a combined view. Readers should view Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Operating free cash flow (“OFCF”), also a non-GAAP measure, represents Segment Adjusted EBITDA less property and equipment additions. OFCF is an additional metric that we use to measure the performance of our operations after considering the level of property and equipment additions incurred during the period. We provide a reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations in this offering memorandum. See “Summary Financial and Operating Data”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra-high-speed internet service across our markets, be it through fiber, cable or mobile technology. At December 31, 2020, our combined businesses owned and operated networks that passed 6,665,800 homes and served 3,193,000 fixed-line customers and 2,244,000 mobile subscribers. In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of these countries, except in Poland, where we operate the second largest cable network. We provide mobile services to our customers (i) in Switzerland as a mobile network operator, as well as a mobile virtual network operator (an “MVNO”) through third-party networks (pursuant to certain legacy contracts from before the Sunrise Acquisition (as defined below)) and (ii) in Poland as an MVNO. On a pro forma basis, we generated revenue of €3,292.9 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA of €1,269.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For further information regarding our pro forma financial information, see “Presentation _of Financial_ _and Other Information—Pro_ _Forma Financial _Information” in this Offering Memorandum. For our definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and a_ reconciliation from loss from continuing operations, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information— _Other Financial Measures” and “Summary Financial and Operating Data” in this Offering Memorandum._ For further information regarding our business and the services we provide to our customers, see “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the UPC 2020 Annual Report incorporated by reference herein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,494
270_2,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Strategy,9.2.1,,"We strive to achieve organic revenue and customer growth in our operations by developing and marketing bundled entertainment and information and communications services, and extending and upgrading the quality of our networks where appropriate. As we use the term, organic growth excludes foreign currency translation effects and the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions. While we seek to increase our customer base, we also seek to maximize the average revenue we receive from each household by increasing the penetration of our digital video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services with existing customers through product bundling and upselling. Offering “best in class” connectivity is at the core of our strategy. Today, our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra-high-speed internet service across our markets, be it through fiber, cable or mobile technology. We are striving to extend our reach and reinforce our speed leadership. In most of our footprint we offer converged fixed and mobile experiences in and out of the home, and it is our ambition to further enhance this proposition and make it available to all our customers. In Switzerland, through the merger of Sunrise Communications and UPC, we aim to create a fully converged national champion that is better able to compete and deliver sustainable growth. Through combining both businesses and infrastructures, we aim to stabilize the fixed business and leverage the significant cross-sell opportunity between the fixed and mobile customer bases. As of December 31, 2020, fixed-mobile convergence in Switzerland was 53% of broadband subscribers across all brands, including overlapping customers that are still on separate fixed and mobile contracts. We therefore aim to penetrate the fixed broadband base with full 1 ----- converged bundles. When considering all fixed and mobile customers across brands, there is a significant crosssell opportunity of broadband into the mobile base as well. We aim to achieve this by marketing converged product offerings that drive sales and realise the benefits of convergence, such as improved customer satisfaction and reduced churn. Beyond that, we aim to better execute the significant B2B opportunity by offering an enriched product suite combining the strength of both networks to drive a similar convergence strategy. As part of the integration, we further plan to deliver on our previously communicated and validated financial synergy targets. These financial synergy targets are estimated at an annual run-rate of CHF 275 million and the majority of these relate to low-risk cost and capital expenditure synergies that include savings from MVNO & fixed network migrations, as well as backhaul, marketing & FTE efficiencies. Approximately 75% of synergies are expected to be realized in the first three years and we expect to spend approximately CHF 300 million of costs to capture those synergies, of which CHF 150 million is expected to be spent in the first year (2021).",N/A,as_expected,2021,494
270_2,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Overview and the Structure of the Offering,9.3.1,,"In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Issuer will enter into an accession agreement to the UPC Credit Facility, in substantially the form attached as Annex C to this Offering Memorandum, with UPC Financing and the UPC Credit Facility Agent (the “New Finco Facility Accession Agreement”), pursuant to which the Issuer will make available to UPC Financing an additional facility under the UPC Credit Facility in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued in the offering. The Issuer, as a UPC Credit Facility Lender, will be treated the same as all other UPC Credit Facility Lenders and will have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other UPC Credit Facility Lenders. Through the covenants in the Indenture and the security interests over the Finco Loans (including the New Finco Loan (as defined below)) granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be provided indirectly with the benefits, rights and protections granted to the Issuer as a UPC Credit Facility Lender, including the indirect benefit of the covenants contained in the UPC Credit Facility, the guarantees granted by the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors and the UPC Credit Facility Collateral. See “Description of the UPC Credit Facility”. Thus, in the case of the ongoing obligations of the Borrower Group (as defined in the UPC Credit Facility) under the UPC Credit Facility, the Issuer will be treated in the same way as the other UPC Credit Lenders, with the right to vote as part of the lending group on the basis described in the “Description of the Notes” and to receive principal and interest on the New Finco Loan, which it will in turn use to make payments on the Notes. For a description of procedures under the Indenture and the New Finco Facility Accession Agreements relating to the voting rights of holders of the Notes with respect to decisions under the UPC Credit Facility, see below under “Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver—To the _UPC Credit Facility or the Finco Accession Agreements”. Although the Issuer will have the same voting rights_ as the other UPC Credit Facility Lenders in all matters under the UPC Credit Facility, the Issuer will give its consent to certain amendments to the UPC Credit Facility that UPC Broadband Holding may request in the future at the time it enters into the New Finco Facility Accession Agreement and therefore, will not be entitled to vote on any future request for such amendments. For a description of the UPC Credit Facility Amendments, see “Description of the Notes—New Finco Facility Accession Agreements and the UPC Credit Facility”. Under the UPC Credit Facility, to the extent the Borrower Group is in compliance with certain financial ratios, the borrowers under the UPC Credit Facility, at their discretion and without the consent of the UPC Credit Facility Lenders, are permitted to incur additional pari passu indebtedness pursuant to additional facilities under the UPC Credit Facility, which benefit from the protections provided to all UPC Credit Facility Lenders, including the representations and warranties, covenants, guarantees and security provided thereunder. For a further description of the UPC Credit Facility, see “Description of the Notes—Description of the UPC Credit _Facility”._ On the Issue Date, the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with the fees payable to the Issuer (if any) from UPC financing under the New Finco Facility Fee Letter, will be used by the Issuer to fund a U.S. dollar denominated loan in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued on the Issue Date (the “New Finco Loan”) borrowed under an additional facility (the “New Finco Facility”) under the UPC Credit Facility. The principal amount of the Notes due at maturity, as well as the maturity date, rate of interest and currency, among other things, will be identical to the corresponding provisions of the New Finco Loan. 2 ----- In addition to indirect benefits arising from the protections and security afforded to the Issuer as a UPC Credit Facility Lender in respect of the New Finco Facilities, the holders of Notes will also benefit directly from a first-ranking security in the Collateral granted to the Security Trustee on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, as described in “Description of the Notes—Security”. On the Issue Date, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Trustee will enter into the Collateral Sharing Agreement that will govern the relative rights of creditors under the Notes (including any Additional Notes) and any Additional Debt of the Issuer that will benefit from the shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. Pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the Security Trustee and the Trustee will agree that all proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral will be shared on a pari passu basis by the holders of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) and the creditors of all Additional Debt of the Issuer that benefits from the shared Collateral on a pari passu basis. The Collateral Sharing Agreement will set out, among other things, (i) the relevant ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, (ii) the consent level of the senior creditors required to cast votes and exercise their rights in respect of consents, instructions and remedies under the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the other debt instruments or agreements sharing in the Collateral, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of the Collateral by the Security Trustee and (iii) turnover provisions. The holders and/or lenders, as applicable, of a majority in aggregate principal amount of all Notes (including any Additional Notes) and Additional Debt then outstanding will control any enforcement actions in respect of the Collateral. On or prior to the Issue Date, UPC Broadband Holding, as the parent of the Issuer, will subscribe for share capital in or otherwise contribute equity to (in any manner, including by payment of share premium) the Issuer in the amount of €2 million (the “Issuer Capitalization Amount”).

Neither the Trustee nor the holders of the Notes may, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favour under the Notes Security Documents. The Trustee and the holders of the Notes may only take action to enforce the Notes Security Documents through the Security Trustee and the Collateral Sharing Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Collateral Sharing Agreement, the ability of the 5 ----- Security Trustee to enforce the security interests in the Collateral will be restricted and will be at the discretion of the relevant creditors. See “Description of the Collateral Sharing Agreement” for more information. (3) On the Issue Date, the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be used by the Issuer to fund the New Finco Loan under the New Finco Facility borrowed by UPC Financing under the UPC Credit Facility. The New Finco Loan will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors and secured on a pari passu basis with all other outstanding loans under the UPC Credit Facility by the UPC Credit Facility Collateral. The Issuer, as a UPC Credit Facility Lender, will be treated the same as all other UPC Credit Facility Lenders and will have benefits, rights and protections that are similar to those benefits, rights and protections afforded to other UPC Credit Facility Lenders. (4) UPC Broadband Holding, UPC Financing Partnership (“UPC Financing”) and certain other members of the UPC Holding Group are currently borrowers under the UPC Credit Facility. The UPC Credit Facility is currently guaranteed by the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors and secured by the UPC Credit Facility Collateral. As of December 31, 2020 (before giving effect to the Transactions) the UPC Holding Group had €3,899.3 million of outstanding borrowings under the UPC Credit Facility. See “Description of the UPC Credit _Facility and the Related Agreements—UPC Credit Facility”. The UPC Credit Facility Guarantors represented more than 80% of the_ consolidated EBITDA of the Borrower Group as of December 31, 2020. (5) The Existing Senior Notes issued by UPC Holding consist of the 2028 Senior Notes and the 2029 Senior Notes. See “Description of _Other Indebtedness”._ (6) UPC Poland Holding B.V. (“UPC Poland Holding”), UPC Slovakia Holding I B.V. (“UPC Slovakia Holding”) and Liberty Global Finance II (UK) Limited, along with certain other subsidiaries of UPC Poland Holding and UPC Slovakia Holding, have been designated as “Affiliate Subsidiaries” under the indentures governing the Existing Senior Notes. (7) The Existing SPE Senior Secured Notes consisted of the 2027 SPE Senior Secured Notes and the 2029 SPE Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds of which were used to fund Facility AQ and Facility AK respectively under the UPC Credit Facility. See “Description of Other _Indebtedness”. The 2027 SPE Senior Secured Notes are expected to be redeemed in full as part of the Transactions._ (8) The SPE SSN Issuers consist of UPCB Finance VII and UPCB Finance IV, each of which are incorporated in the Cayman Islands and owned 100% by charitable trusts. Although UPC Financing has no equity or voting interest in UPCB Finance VII or UPCB Finance IV, the Facility AQ loan and Facility AK loan create a variable interest in UPCB Finance VII and UPCB Finance IV respectively, for which UPC Financing is the primary beneficiary, as contemplated by U.S. GAAP. As such, following the issuance of the Existing SPE Senior Secured Notes, UPC Financing and its parent entities, including UPC Holding, were required by the provisions of U.S. GAAP to consolidate the SPE SSN Issuers. Accordingly, the amount outstanding under Facility AQ and Facility AK is eliminated within the UPC Holding Group’s combined financial statements.

Readers should view Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Operating free cash flow (“OFCF”), also a non-GAAP measure, represents Segment Adjusted EBITDA less property and equipment additions. OFCF is an additional metric that we use to measure the performance of our operations after considering the level of property and equipment additions incurred during the period.

For example, the financial maintenance tests include leverage ratios, and the restrictive covenants impact our ability to: - pay dividends or make other distributions, or redeem or repurchase equity interests or subordinated obligations; - make investments; - sell assets, including the capital stock of subsidiaries; - enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and certain vendor financing arrangements; - create liens; - enter into agreements that restrict some of our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, transfer assets or make related-party loans; - merge or consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and - enter into certain transactions with affiliates. These limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt.

Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness.

A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. In particular, we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily through the credit facilities of certain of our subsidiaries, which are indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) or other base rates (including the Euro short-term rate). Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all.

Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law. English insolvency law may not be as favorable to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In addition, certain UPC Credit Facility Obligors are incorporated under the laws of Delaware. Although laws differ among jurisdictions, in general, applicable insolvency laws in such jurisdictions and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts would limit the enforceability of judgments against the UPC Credit Facility Obligors. The following discussion of insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdictions’ insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors or an appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the UPC Credit Facility Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a UPC Credit Facility Guarantor’s obligations under its UPC Credit Facility Guarantee; - direct that the UPC Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) return any amounts paid under a UPC Credit Facility Guarantee to the relevant UPC Credit Facility Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the relevant UPC Credit Facility Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to UPC Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) and, indirectly, holders of the Notes. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a UPC Credit Facility Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the UPC Credit Facility Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a UPC Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a UPC Credit Facility Guarantor was insolvent on the date its UPC Credit Facility Guarantee was issued, that payments to the Issuer under the New Finco Loan to, in turn, make payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. In the event that the validity or enforceability of the UPC Credit Facility Guarantees is adversely affected, we cannot assure you that the Issuer will ever be able to repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

Insolvency Regulation”), a company’s location of its centre of main interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary and provided that the company did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a request to open insolvency proceedings. The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and several of the UPC Credit Facility Obligors are incorporated in the Netherlands and have their statutory seat (statutaire _zetel) in the Netherlands. Consequently, in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to the_ Issuer and such UPC Credit Facility Obligors, primary proceedings would likely be initiated in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency laws may make it difficult or impossible to effect a restructuring. If the Issuer’s or such UPC Credit Facility Obligors’ COMI was found to be in another E.U. jurisdiction and not in the Netherlands, main insolvency proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, suspension of payments (surseance _van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable a company to continue as_ a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is designed to liquidate and distribute the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Upon commencement of suspension of payments proceedings, the court will grant a provisional suspension. A definitive suspension will generally be granted in a creditors’ meeting called for that purpose, unless a qualified minority (more than one-quarter in amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or one-third in number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent or if there is no prospect that the company will in the future be able to pay its debts as they fall due (in which case the company will generally be declared bankrupt). During a suspension of payments, unsecured and non-preferential creditors will be precluded from attempting to recover their claims from the assets of the company. A suspension of payments is subject to exceptions, the most important of which excludes secured creditors and preferential creditors (such as tax and social security authorities and employees) from the application of the suspension. This implies that during suspension of payments proceedings secured creditors may proceed against the assets that secure their claims to satisfy their claims, and preferential creditors are also not barred from seeking to recover their claims. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. In a suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered by the company to its creditors. Such a composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors, irrespective whether they voted in favour or against it or whether they were represented at the creditor’s meeting called for the purpose of voting on the composition plan, if (i) it is approved by more than 50% in number of the general unsecured and non-preferential creditors present or represented at the creditor’s meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the general unsecured and nonpreferential claims admitted for voting purposes and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to a company’s creditors on a pari passu basis. Certain creditors (such as secured creditors and preferential creditors) have special rights that may adversely affect the interests of holders of the Notes and the Issuer, as lender under the respective New Finco Loan. For example, a Dutch bankruptcy does not prohibit secured creditors from taking recourse against the encumbered assets of the bankrupt debtor to satisfy their claims. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the potential recovery of a holder of the Notes or the Issuer, as lender under the respective New Finco Loan in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. To obtain payment on unsecured non-preferential claims, such claims need to be submitted to the trustee in bankruptcy (curator) for verification. “Verification” under Dutch law means that the trustee verifies the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it may be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on 44 ----- the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Generally, claims of holders of the Notes which were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or, in the case of the New Finco Loan, the date of a bankruptcy of the relevant UPC Credit Facility Obligor, are only admissible for verification for their net present value if they mature more than one year after opening of the bankruptcy. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the trustee of the Issuer for verification. Creditors that wish to dispute the valuation of their claims by the trustee will need to commence a court proceeding. These verification procedures could result in holders of the Notes and the Issuer, as lender under the relevant New Finco Loan, receiving a right to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or amounts owed under such New Finco Loan, as the case may be. In addition, in a Dutch bankruptcy in practice usually no or little funds remain available for the payment of unsecured and non-preferential creditors. In a bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to the unsecured and non-preferential creditors. Such a composition will be binding upon all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if (i) it is approved by a simple majority of a meeting of the recognized and admitted creditors representing at least 50% of the amount of the recognized and of the admitted claims and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. On 6 October 2020 the Dutch legislator has adopted a bill for the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord), with the aim to implement a restructuring instrument enabling companies in financial distress to restructure their debts without the need to initiate formal insolvency procedures (such as bankruptcy or moratorium of payments). The bill has entered into force on 1 January 2021. The goal of the new legislation is to introduce a preventive restructuring procedure enabling debtors in financial difficulties to restructure at an early stage and avoid insolvency. A restructuring plan under the new legislation can be proposed by a debtor who foresees that it will not be able to continue paying its due and payable debts (the debts as they fall due). Under such circumstances, the debtor or a court appointed restructuring specialist may offer a restructuring plan to the debtor’s creditors and shareholders. A restructuring plan could propose an amendment or (partial) discharge of the rights and claims of all creditors and shareholders involved. Once approved and confirmed by the relevant percentage of creditors and the court, such restructuring plan is binding on all creditors and shareholders involved. Subject to certain safeguards, creditors and shareholders who have voted against the restructuring plan could be (cross-) crammed down and thus be bound by the restructuring plan. Taking into account the provisions in the act, claims against a debtor can, inter alia, be (partially) discharged or extended as a result of a restructuring plan if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more senior class vote in favour of such a plan and the court subsequently approves the plan. Under the Temporary Act COVID 19 Ministry of Social Affairs and Ministry of Justice (Tijdelijke wet _COVID-19 SZW en JV) a debtor is (amongst others) entitled to request the court for suspension of enforcement_ measures and/or any court decisions concerning bankruptcy petitions. The court may grant such request of the debtor under certain specific circumstances, such as either (i) a suspension is necessary for continuation of the company’s activities, or (ii) it is summarily evidenced that the current financial situation is mainly (or entirely) caused by the measures imposed as from 16 March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as a result of which the company is temporarily unable to pay its debts, and it is evidenced that the financial situation of the company before the COVID-19 outbreak was normal and is expected to improve in the (near) future. If approved, such suspension would be initially granted for two months and could be extended by up to two additional suspension periods of two months each. The temporary act entered into force on 17 December 2020 and was originally scheduled to expire on 1 February 2021. The expiration date has since then been extended by Royal Decree to 1 April 2021 and can be further extended indefinitely for periods of two months each. As a consequence of the foregoing, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the recovery of holders of the Notes and the Issuer, as lender under the New Finco Loan, in a Dutch insolvency proceeding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company has certain powers to apply to the court to challenge transactions entered into by that company if the company was unable to pay its debts (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986) at the time of the transaction or if the company became unable to pay its debts as a 45 ----- result of the transaction. Generally, only an administrator or liquidator of a company may bring a claim challenging a reviewable transaction. For example, transactions that can be challenged include preferences and transactions at an undervalue. A transaction might be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue if it involved the relevant company making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms under which it received no consideration, or the company received significantly less value (in money or money’s worth) than it gave in return. The court can set aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the company within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. A court generally will not intervene in circumstances where a company entered into the transaction in good faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. The Issuer cannot assure holders of the Notes that in the event of insolvency the UPC Credit Facility Guarantees by the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors incorporated in England and Wales would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support our analysis that the guarantees have been entered into in good faith for the purposes described above. A transaction might be challenged as a preference where, in the event of the relevant company going into insolvent liquidation, the relevant company has done something or suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better position than the creditor, surety or guarantor would have otherwise been in. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the English company was influenced by a desire to prefer that party. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety or guarantor of the company then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if the company had not given that preference (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection in specific circumstances for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value without notice of the relevant circumstances). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire, on the part of the company, to prefer them. If the preference is given to a person connected to the company (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), the court looks back and sets aside those preferences entered into in the period of two years ending with the date of the onset of the company’s insolvency. If the person is not connected to the company, the court can only go back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the onset of insolvency. If a court voided any UPC Credit Facility Guarantee, or any payment thereunder, as a result of a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, or held it unenforceable or set it aside for any other reason (including by reason of fraudulent transfer or conveyance), the UPC Credit Facility Lenders (including the Issuer) would cease to have any claim against the applicable UPC Credit Facility Guarantor under its UPC Credit Facility Guarantee. In such circumstances, if UPC Financing cannot satisfy its obligations under the New Finco Loan, we cannot assure you that the Issuer will be able to ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. The Issuer and certain of the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors are incorporated under the Dutch law. Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside of bankruptcy, the so-called actio pauliana provisions. The actio pauliana offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om _niet) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of_ fraudulent conveyance. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Notes by the Issuer and the granting by the Issuer of the Collateral and the granting of the UPC Credit Facility Collateral by the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors involved 46 ----- a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Note or the granting of the Collateral and the UPC Credit Facility Collateral could be nullified. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes and the Collateral and the UPC Credit Facility Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes or the Issuer, as applicable, received with respect to the Notes and the Collateral and the UPC Credit Facility Collateral as applicable, could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the other creditors of the Issuer or the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors, as applicable, and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes and the Issuer might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the UPC Credit Facility Guarantors, as applicable, as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,494
270_2,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Relating to the Notes and the Structure,13.2.22,The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act may affect the ability of creditors to commence insolvency proceedings.,"The U.K. government introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill into the U.K. Parliament on May 20, 2020 and the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act (“CIGA”) came into effect on June 26, 2020. The U.K. government also introduced the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020, which came into effect on September 29, 2020; the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Early Termination of Certain Temporary Provisions) Regulation 2020, which came into effect on October 1, 2020; the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Liability for Wrongful Trading and Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations 2020, which came into effect on November 26, 2020; and the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) (No 2) Regulations 2020, which came into effect on December 9, 2020 (together, the “CIGA Regulations”). The CIGA has introduced significant new corporate restructuring tools to the U.K. insolvency regime. Some of the new measures are temporary in nature and have been introduced specifically to support businesses experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The CIGA Regulations have extended the effect of certain temporary measures due to the continuing impact of COVID-19. The new temporary measures include a suspension of the personal liability of directors for wrongful trading (which applied retrospectively from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020 and for a second period from November 26, 2020 until June 30, 2021). CIGA also introduced a prohibition on the presentation of winding up petitions on or after April 27, 2020 as a result of a company’s failure to meet a statutory demand served on them between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021. In addition, until June 30, 2021, a creditor cannot present a winding-up petition based on a company’s inability to pay its debts unless they have reasonable grounds to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a financial effect on the company, or the relevant facts giving rise to such winding-up petition would have arisen even if the COVID-19 pandemic had not had a financial effect on the company. Other new measures are permanent rather than temporary in nature and may have a significant impact on the way creditors and others interact with businesses in financial difficulty. The CIGA has introduced permanent reforms in three key areas: a free-standing moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Free-standing Moratorium”), a ban on the operation by a supplier of termination provisions which are based on a formal insolvency procedure in contracts for the supply of goods and/or services (or so called ipso facto clauses), with exemptions for certain entities and financial contracts and the introduction of a restructuring plan for a company in financial difficulty under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Part 26A Restructuring Plan”). The aim of the Free-standing Moratorium is to stay creditor action against a distressed but viable company in order to facilitate a rescue as a going concern and/or restructuring. The Free-standing Moratorium is available to eligible companies, for a limited initial period of 20 business days subject to permitted extensions. Any extension beyond 40 business days will require the consent of the company’s pre-moratorium creditors (among other conditions) or the consent of court. The Free-standing Moratorium is supervised by a licenced insolvency practitioner, who is appointed as ‘monitor’. The Free-standing Moratorium gives the company a payment holiday for specified debts. It also restricts creditor action and enforcement (for example, no floating charge holder is able to give notice to crystallize a floating charge (subject to certain exceptions), whilst imposing controls on the company entering into certain transactions. The Free-standing Moratorium does not provide a payment holiday for, among other things, pre-moratorium debts arising under certain financial services contracts (including, for example, loan and other credit agreements). Certain companies are excluded from being eligible for the Freestanding Moratorium including, among others, insurance companies, certain financial institutions and any company that is party to a ‘capital market arrangement’. A capital market arrangement is an arrangement regarding a debt of at least £10 million under the arrangement (at any time during the life of the capital market 47 ----- arrangement), where a company has provided security to a trustee or agent, guaranteed or secured the obligations of another party, or invested in certain options, futures or other derivatives, in each case under a capital markets instrument. The provisions under the CIGA that ban the operation of termination provisions in contracts for the supply of goods and/or services where the company has entered into a relevant insolvency procedure (including the Free-standing Moratorium, administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, provisional liquidation or a Part 26A Restructuring Plan) will help to prevent the disruption of supply chains but may have a significant effect on suppliers. The CIGA Regulations extended a temporary measured introduced by the CIGA, which excludes small suppliers from the effects of restriction on termination through to June 30, 2021. The Part 26A Restructuring Plan offers an alternative to the existing scheme of arrangement. Similar to a scheme of arrangement the Part 26A Restructuring Plan needs to be court-approved and requires a creditor meeting and vote. However, unlike a scheme of arrangement, subject to certain conditions, the Part 26A Restructuring Plan may bind certain dissenting classes of creditors, known as a “cross-class cram down”. This means that a Part 26A Restructuring Plan may be adopted even where one or more class does not vote in favor of the plan provided (a) the court is satisfied that if the Part 26A Restructuring Plan were sanctioned no creditor in the dissenting class would be worse off than it would be in what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario for the company if the Part 26A Restructuring Plan were not sanctioned and (b) the Part 26A Restructuring Plan has been agreed by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the most likely alternative scenario referred to in (a) above. The Free-standing Moratorium and cross-class cram-down restructuring procedures in particular have a significant effect on the ability of creditors and others to commence insolvency proceedings and on the enforcement of rights and legal proceedings, including, among other things, rights under a floating charge. The provisions under CIGA which ban the operation of ipso facto clauses will help to prevent the disruption of supply chains but may have a significant effect on suppliers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain a listing (whether on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange or on another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers) if such listing is not required for the Issuer to benefit from an exemption on withholding tax on interest payments on the Notes or to otherwise prevent tax from being withheld from interest payments on the Notes.

Following any such repayment, the Issuer will redeem all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the date of redemption. Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to a redemption in connection with a Change of Control unless the Majority Lenders under the UPC Credit Facility requires that UPC Financing prepay the UPC Credit Facility and as a result the Issuer may not control actions relating to prepayment of the UPC Credit Facility in the event of a Change of Control. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to UPC Financing to prepay the relevant New Finco Loan, or that the restrictions in the indentures governing the Existing Senior Notes or our other existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required prepayment. A Change of Control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of the Existing Senior Notes and other indebtedness. The acceleration or prepayment of the New Finco Loan could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. 49 ----- The ability of UPC Financing to receive cash from its subsidiaries or other members of the Borrower Group to allow UPC Financing to prepay the New Finco Loan (and in turn for the Issuer to redeem the Notes), following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required prepayment. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to UPC Financing for the purpose of prepaying the New Finco Loan, we may seek the consent of the creditors under such indebtedness to prepay the New Finco Loan (and in turn for the Issuer to repurchase the Notes) or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained or such refinancing cannot be consummated, UPC Financing will remain prohibited from prepaying the New Finco Loan. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make a prepayment of the New Finco Loan upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing.

The definition of “covered fund” under the Volcker Rule includes, in part, any issuer that would be an investment company under the 1940 Act but for the exclusions provided under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on the exclusion under Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it will be considered a covered fund for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. In the event the Issuer is considered a “covered fund”, “banking entities” that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer, unless such banking entity is able to rely on an applicable exemption under the Volcker Rule. “Ownership interest” is broadly defined under the Volcker Rule as “any equity, partnership, or other similar interest”. The Notes are not equity or partnership interests. The phrase “other similar interest” is further defined under the Volcker Rule as an interest that: (A) Has the right to participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member of the board of directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading advisor of the covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event); (B) Has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the covered fund; (C) Has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event); (D) Has the right to receive all or a portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate interest paid to the holders of other outstanding interests); (E) Provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the covered fund with respect to the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; (F) Receives income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or (G) Any synthetic right to have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above. On the Issue Date, pursuant to and in accordance with the Indenture, the Trustee will be appointed to act as trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the Security Trustee will be appointed to act as security trustee 53 ----- for the creditors (including the holders of the Notes) that will benefit from the Collateral (the “CSA Secured",N/A,as_expected,2021,494
270_2,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,"Parties”). Subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Collateral Sharing Agreement,",13.3.1,,"prior to the occurrence of a CSA Enforcement Event (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) (following the occurrence of an Event of Default under (and as defined in the Indenture) which is continuing and the acceleration of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the Indenture), the Issuer may continue to exercise its rights under the Transactions Documents (as defined under “Description of the Notes”), including with respect to its assets comprising the Collateral, and the provisions of the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents will not otherwise afford any holder of the Notes with the right to: (i) take any corporate action or other steps or legal proceedings for the winding-up, dissolution or reorganization or for the appointment of a receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator, examiner or similar officer of the Issuer or of its revenues and assets; or (ii) take any steps for the purpose of obtaining payments of amounts payable to it under the Notes, the Indenture or any Notes Security Document, or to take any steps to recover any debts whatsoever owing to it by the Issuer. See “Description of the Notes”. These rights of the holders of the Notes to enforce the rights and remedies granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and Notes Security Documents are the types of rights that are excluded from the rights that are included in the definition of “other similar interests”. The holders of the Notes have no rights under the Notes or the Indenture to participate in the selection or removal of any of the types of partners, members or managers of the Issuer described in Clause (A) above. The Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UPC Broadband Holding. The holders of the Notes have no rights to participate in the selection or removal of the Issuer’s board of directors or management. The holders of the Notes have no rights under the Notes or the Indenture to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the Issuer as described in Clause (B) above, and have no rights to receive the underlying assets of the Issuer after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event) as described in Clause (C) above. The Issuer is a financing company which, so long as any of the Notes are outstanding, will be subject to the restrictions set out in the Indenture and the other Transaction Documents. The Notes will be subject to the Limited Recourse Restrictions (as further described in the “Description of the Notes” included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum). The only assets of the Issuer available to meet claims of the holders of the Notes and the other CSA Secured Parties are the assets comprising the Collateral, which (as described above) cannot be enforced prior to a CSA Enforcement Event in accordance with the Collateral Sharing Agreement. The holders of the Notes have no rights to receive any excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of Issuer and the aggregate interest paid to the holders of the Notes) as described in Clause (D) above. On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue the Notes, which will bear interest at a fixed rate per annum as further described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. While the Issuer, as a financing company, is wholly dependent on the payments it will receive in respect of the New Finco Loan, the New Finco Facility Accession Agreement and the applicable Related Agreements, and a failure by the UPC Credit Facility Obligors (with respect to the New Finco Loan and New Finco Facility Accession Agreement) or UPC Financing and/or UPC Broadband Holding (with respect to the Related Agreements) to provide such funding may, in practice, negatively impact the Issuer’s ability to meet its obligations under the Indenture and Notes. However, subject to the Limited Recourse Restrictions, there are no contractual terms of the Notes under the Indenture or the other Note Security Documents which provide that the amounts payable by the Issuer (whether as principal or interest) with respect to the Notes will be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the Issuer as described in Clause (E) above. Furthermore, as the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, the rate of interest on the Notes is not determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the Issuer as described in Clause (F) above. In addition, the Issuer expects that the holders of the Notes will not receive income on a passthrough basis from the Issuer as described in Clause (F) above, as the Issuer expects that the holders of the Notes will hold the Notes as debt and not as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “—Risks Relating to the _Notes and the Structure—The Issuer is a financing company which will depend on payments under the New Finco Loan to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes” and “Description of the Notes”_ included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer will not be entitled to make any modifications to the terms of the Notes which would have the effect of reducing the principal amount of the Notes or reducing the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on the Notes, without the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. See “Description of the Notes”. 54 ----- The Indenture, the Transaction Documents and the Notes Security Document Documents do not confer upon the holders of the Notes any synthetic rights to have, receive or be allocated any of the rights in Clauses (A) through (F) above. On June 25, 2020, the relevant federal regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule released a final rule to amend certain parts of the Volcker Rule’s covered fund-related restrictions. The proposed changes are intended to improve and streamline certain aspects of the “covered funds” portion of the Volcker Rule, including by, among other aspects, making modifications to certain existing exclusions from the definition of “covered fund”, creating certain new exclusions from the definition of “covered fund”, and making certain clarifications to the definition of “ownership interest”. The final rule became effective on October 1, 2020. Before making an investment in the Notes, each potential investor in the Notes should consult with its own counsel and make its own determination as to whether it is subject to the Volcker Rule, whether the Notes constitute “ownership interests”, whether any exclusion or exemption under the Volcker Rule might be applicable to an investment in the Notes by such investor, whether its investment in the Notes would be restricted or prohibited under the Volcker Rule, and the potential impact of the Volcker Rule on its investment, any liquidity in connection therewith and on its portfolio generally. See “Transfer Restrictions”. None of the UPC Holding Group, the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Trustee nor any of their respective affiliates makes any representation to any prospective investor or purchaser of the Notes regarding the treatment of the Issuer or the Notes under the Volcker Rule or to the impact of the Volcker Rule on such investor’s investment in the Notes on the Issue Date or at any time in the future. The Volcker Rule and any similar measures introduced in another relevant jurisdiction may impact the price and liquidity of the Notes in the secondary market or restrict prospective investors’ ability to hold the Notes. Each purchaser is responsible for analyzing its own regulatory position under the Volcker Rule and any similar measures. 55 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

Instead, DTC will credit on its book-entry registration and transfer system a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the U.S., may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge book-entry interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, “holders” of book-entry interests will not be considered the owners of the Notes for any purpose. Only the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note. So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC (or its nominee) will be considered the holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.

If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and will not be entitled to Definitive Registered Notes except as provided in “—Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes” above. The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-entry interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer Restrictions”. During the Resale Restriction Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is both a QIB and also a Qualified Purchaser in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer _Restrictions” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other_ jurisdictions. After the expiration of the Resale Restriction Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency without compliance with these certification requirements. Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A (if available). Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions”, book-entry interests may be transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any book-entry interest in a Global Note that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a book-entry interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination and series will, upon transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the firstmentioned Global Note and become a book-entry interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to book-entry interests in such other Global Note for as long as that person retains such a book-entry interest. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for book-entry interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Definitive Registered Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions”. Transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S book-entry interest for Rule 144A book-entry interest in a Dollar Global Note will be done by DTC by means of an instruction originating from the registrar through the DTC Deposit/Withdrawal Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the corresponding Rule 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of unrestricted book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the Resale Restriction Period. Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a book-entry interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a book-entry interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to book-entry interest in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a book-entry interest. 149 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

We provide the following summary of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of DTC are controlled by DTC and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law; - a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks, brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to DTC and are known as indirect participants. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in DTC or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through DTC will receive distributions attributable to the Global Notes only through DTC.",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross-market transfers of the interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers with respect to interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by the common depository; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines of such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common depository to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes from DTC, and making and receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depository. Because of time-zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a DTC participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be 150 ----- reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date. The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchaser determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any book-entry interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date. Although DTC currently follows the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, it is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. 151 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

Each purchaser acknowledges that we and the Trustee under the Indenture reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer pursuant to clauses (d) or (e) prior to the applicable Resale Restriction Termination Date to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and the Trustee. (6) The purchaser understands that if it is a non-U.S. person outside of the United States, the Notes will be represented by a Regulation S Global Note and that transfers of such notes are restricted as described in this section and in the section entitled “Book-Entry Settlement and Clearance” or if it is a QIB that is also a Qualified Purchaser, the Notes it purchases will be represented by a Rule 144A Global Note. Such purchaser also confirms that it is not a retail investor in the EEA or the U.K. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the U.K. may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

(10) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchaser and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Purchaser. If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account. (11) The purchaser represents that (i) no portion of the assets used by it to acquire and hold the Notes constitutes assets of any employee benefits plan or similar arrangement or (ii) the purchase and holding of the Notes by it will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or a violation under any applicable similar laws.

Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth hereunder. (13) The purchaser understands that the Issuer will likely be a “covered fund” as defined in the Volcker Rule. The definition of “covered fund” in the Volcker Rule includes, among other things, any entity that would be an “investment company” under the 1940 Act, but for the exclusions provided under Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) thereunder. Because the Issuer will rely on Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, it will be considered a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule, unless it fits within an applicable exclusion from the definition of “covered fund”. Accordingly, in the event the Issuer is considered a “covered fund”, “banking entities” (as defined under the Volcker Rule) that are subject to the Volcker Rule may be prohibited under the Volcker Rule from, among other things, acquiring or retaining an “ownership interest” in the Issuer as a “covered fund”, unless such “banking entity” is able to rely on 155 ----- an applicable exemption under the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, “ownership interest” is broadly defined to include any equity, partnership or other similar interest. The phrase “other similar interest” is further defined under the Volcker Rule to include any interest that: (a) has the right to participate in the selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, member of the board of directors or trustees, investment manager, investment advisor, or commodity trading advisor of the covered fund (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event; (b) has the right under the terms of the interest to receive a share of the income, gains or profits of the covered fund; (c) has the right to receive the underlying assets of the covered fund after all other interests have been redeemed and/or paid in full (excluding the rights of a creditor to exercise remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default or an acceleration event); (d) has the right to receive all or a portion of excess spread (the positive difference, if any, between the aggregate interest payments received from the underlying assets of the covered fund and the aggregate interest paid to the holders of other outstanding interests); (e) provides under the terms of the interest that the amounts payable by the covered fund with respect to the interest could be reduced based on losses arising from the underlying assets of the covered fund, such as allocation of losses, write-downs or charge-offs of the outstanding principal balance, or reductions in the amount of interest due and payable on the interest; (f) receives income on a pass-through basis from the covered fund, or has a rate of return that is determined by reference to the performance of the underlying assets of the covered fund; or (g) any synthetic right to have, receive, or be allocated any of the rights in (a) through (f) above.",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

This description only applies to Notes held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and does not address, except as set forth below, aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as: - banks or other financial institutions; - insurance companies; - real estate investment trusts, individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts; - regulated investment companies; - grantor trusts; - tax-exempt organizations; - persons that will own the Notes through partnerships or other pass-through entities; - dealers or traders in securities or currencies; - U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; - certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United States; - U.S. Holders that use a mark-to-market method of accounting; or - U.S. Holders that will hold a Note as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion or integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, this description does not address the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or alternative minimum tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Notes and does not address the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income that may also apply to certain U.S. Holders’ capital gains and interest in respect of the Notes or rules requiring persons that use the accrual method of accounting to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. This description does not address U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the Notes as part of the initial distribution at their initial issue price (generally, the first price to the public at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money). Each prospective purchaser should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes. This description is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) (“Code”), U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, each as available and in effect on the date hereof. All of the foregoing are subject to change or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect), which could affect the tax considerations described herein. No opinion of counsel or ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be given with respect to any of the considerations discussed herein. No assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position different from any of the tax considerations discussed below. For purposes of this description, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes who for U.S. federal income tax purposes is: - an individual that is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, including the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust (1) that has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (2)(a) the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the substantial decisions of which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the 158 ----- partner and the activities of the partnership. Such partner or partnership should consult its tax advisor as to its consequences. The discussion below assumes that the Notes are treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except as otherwise described.

For purposes of Dutch tax law, a holder of Notes may include an individual or entity who does not have the legal title of these Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes or the income thereof is attributed based on specific statutory provisions or on the basis of such individual or entity having an interest in the Notes or the income thereof. This summary is intended as general information only and each prospective investor should consult a professional tax adviser with respect to the tax consequences of the acquisition, holding, redemption and disposal of the Notes. This summary is based on tax legislation, published case law, treaties, regulations and published policy, in each case as in force as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and it does not take into account any developments or amendments thereof after that date whether or not such developments or amendments have retroactive effect. This summary does not address the Dutch corporate and individual income tax consequences for: (a) investment institutions (fiscale beleggingsinstellingen); (b) pension funds, exempt investment institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) or other Dutch tax resident entities that are not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax; (c) holders of Notes holding a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) or deemed substantial interest (fictief aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer and holders of Notes of whom a certain related person holds a substantial interest in the Issuer. Generally speaking, a substantial interest in the Issuer arises if a person, alone or, where such person is an individual, together with his or her partner (statutorily defined term), directly or indirectly, holds or is deemed to hold (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total issued capital of the Issuer or 5% or more of the issued capital of a certain class of shares of the Issuer, (ii) rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such interest or (iii) certain profit-sharing rights in the Issuer; (d) persons to whom the Notes and the income therefrom are attributed based on the separated private assets (afgezonderd particulier vermogen) provisions of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet _inkomstenbelasting 2001);_ (e) entities which are a resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten and that have an enterprise which is carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative on Bonaire, Sint Eustatius or Saba and the Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative; and (f) individuals to whom the Notes or the income there from are attributable to employment activities which are taxed as employment income in the Netherlands.

270_2,Offerings 2021.md,125,CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS,125.1,,125.1.1,,"The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, including, without limitation, entities such as collective investment funds, certain insurance company separate accounts, certain insurance company general accounts, and entities whose underlying assets are treated as being subject to ERISA (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan under ERISA. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws (as defined below). Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain persons who are “parties in interest” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and/or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may have to be rescinded. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if the Notes are acquired with the assets of a Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates, is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Even if none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee is a party in interest or a disqualified person, a prohibited transaction may arise if the fiduciary authorizing the investment has an interest in or affiliation with any of the foregoing parties that may affect his, her or its judgment as a fiduciary. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a Note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 84-14, as amended (relating to transactions effected by “independent qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 95-60 (relating to investments by insurance company general accounts), and PTCE 96-23, as amended (relating to transactions effected by in-house asset managers), (collectively, the “Investor-Based Exemptions”). There is also a statutory exemption that may be available under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code to a person that is a party in interest solely by reason of being a service provider to a Plan investing in the Notes for adequate consideration or an affiliate of such service provider, provided such service provider is not a fiduciary with respect to the Plan’s assets used to acquire the Notes or an affiliate of such fiduciary (the “Service Provider Exemption”). Adequate consideration means fair market as determined in good faith by the Plan fiduciary pursuant to regulations to be promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor. However, there can be no assurance that any of these InvestorBased Exemptions or the Service Provider Exemption or any other administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. “Governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA or Section 4975(g)(3) of the Code) and certain non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Laws”). The purchase of the Notes using the assets of a Plan might be deemed to be a violation of the prohibited transaction rules of Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for which no exemption may be available. Accordingly, the Notes may not be purchased using the assets of any Plan if the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or their respective affiliates is the sponsor of, or Fiduciary to, such Plan in the absence of an applicable exemption. 166 ----- EACH ACQUIRER AND EACH TRANSFEREE OF A NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT, WARRANT AND AGREE THAT AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THAT IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN THAT (1) EITHER (A) IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF (AND FOR SO LONG AS IT HOLDS THIS NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN IT WILL NOT BE, AND WILL NOT BE ACTING ON BEHALF OF) (I) AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(3) OF ERISA, THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF PART 4 OF SUBTITLE B OF TITLE I OF ERISA, (II) AN INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT OR OTHER PLAN OR ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE APPLIES, OR (III) AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS INCLUDE “PLAN ASSETS” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF 29 C.F.R.

The transfer of any Note or any interest therein to a Plan or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan that is subject to any Similar Laws is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers or the Trustee, or any of their respective affiliates, that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by such plans generally or any particular such plan; that the Investor-Based Exemptions or the Service Provider Exemption described above, or any other prohibited transaction exemption, would apply to such an investment by such plans in general or any particular such plan; or that such an investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular such plan. The discussion of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code contained in this Offering Memorandum, is, of necessity, general, and does not purport to be complete. Moreover, the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. Therefore, the matters discussed above may be affected by future regulations, rulings and court decisions, some of which may have retroactive application and effect. Any Plan or employee benefit plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and any fiduciary thereof, proposing to participate in the offers and acquire the Notes or any interest therein should consult with its legal advisors regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws, to such investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of any applicable requirement of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws. 167 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

Attention is drawn to the information set out on the inside front cover of this document in respect of restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes and on distribution of documents. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange as soon as practicable after the Issue Date. The Initial Purchasers are not under an obligation to make a market in the Notes and any market making activity, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a secondary market for the Notes will develop, or if one does develop, that it will continue. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of or trading market for the Notes. No action has been taken or is being contemplated by the Issuer that would permit a public offering of the Notes or possession or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any amendment thereof, or supplement thereto or any other offering material relating to the Notes in any jurisdiction where, or in any other circumstances in which, action for those purposes is required. No offers, sales or deliveries of any Notes, or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other offering material relating to the Notes, may be made in or from any jurisdiction except in circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations and will not impose any obligations on the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers. Because of the restrictions contained in the front of this Offering Memorandum, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of the Notes. The Notes are offered when, as and if issued, subject to prior sale or withdrawal, cancellation or modification of the offer without notice and subject to approval of certain legal matters by counsel and certain other conditions. Persons into whose hands this Offering Memorandum comes are required by the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in which they purchase, offer, sell or deliver Notes or have in their possession, distribute or publish this Offering Memorandum or any other offering material relating to the Notes, in all cases at their own expense. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various consulting, financial advisory, investment banking, commercial lending and capital markets services for the UPC Holding Group and Liberty Global, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to subsidiaries of Liberty Global or the UPC Holding Group in the past. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with, and/or own outstanding debt securities of, the UPC Holding Group and/or their affiliates, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have hedged, routinely hedge and are likely to hedge in the future, their credit exposure to the UPC Holding Group and/or their affiliates consistent with their 169 ----- risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates provide the UPC Holding Group and/or their affiliates, from time to time, with hedging services, and may act as counterparties to certain hedging agreements entered into by the UPC Holding Group and/or their affiliates and such parties will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under facilities of the UPC Credit Facility or holders of the 2027 SPE Senior Secured Notes, certain of which will be repaid with the proceeds from the offering of the Notes and are parties to certain related hedging arrangements with the UPC Holding Group and/or their subsidiaries.

Subject to the terms and conditions in the purchase agreement relating to the Notes between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has severally agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the principal amount of Notes set forth therein. The purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the relevant Notes if any of them are purchased. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase relevant Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Notes are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and other conditions precedent. In the purchase agreement, the Issuer has agreed that: - Subject to certain exceptions, none of the Issuer, UPC Holding or UPC Broadband Holding will sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to any debt securities, which are substantially similar to the Notes, issued by any of the Issuer, UPC Holding or UPC Broadband Holding and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue for a period of 30 days after the date hereof (other than any issuance of Additional Notes (as defined in “Description of the _Notes”) and any other debt securities issued by any of the Issuer, UPC Holding or UPC Broadband_ Holding), without the prior written consent of the Stabilizing Manager. - The Issuer will indemnify the several Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchase of securities. Each purchaser of the Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be deemed to have made by its purchase acknowledgements, representation, warranties and agreements as described under “Transfer _Restrictions”._ The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes at the offering price that appears on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. The offering of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the Initial Purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act. Each Initial Purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the Notes (A) in the United States to QIBs that are also Qualified Purchasers in reliance on Rule 144A and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S. Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons, except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they will do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Managers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a syndicate short position. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Stabilizing Managers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. 168 ----- In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such term is used for the purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of the pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next seven business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.

There is uncertainty concerning the enforcement of English court judgments in the Netherlands following Brexit. As no new reciprocal agreement on civil justice has been agreed, there will be a period of uncertainty concerning the enforcement of English court judgments in the Netherlands.

As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Issuer or the relevant UPC Credit Facility Guarantors. The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated if it finds that (i) the jurisdiction of the U.S. court has been based on grounds that are internationally acceptable, (ii) the judgment by the U.S. court was rendered in legal proceedings that comply with the standards of the proper administration of justice that includes sufficient safeguards (behoorlijke rechtspleging), (iii) the judgment by the U.S. court is not incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a previous decision rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgement in the Netherlands and (iv) the final judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Dutch civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under Dutch law. Enforcement and recognition of judgments of U.S. courts in the Netherlands are governed by the provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).",N/A,as_expected,2021,494

270_2,Offerings 2021.md,1687,SCHEDULE 11 AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES,1687.1,,1687.1.1,,"1. **Security Principles (a) The guarantees and security to be provided will be given in accordance with the security principles set out in this Schedule (the “Security Principles”). This Schedule addresses the manner in which the Security Principles will impact on the guarantees and security proposed to be taken in relation to this transaction. (b) The Security Principles embody recognition by all Parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security from all Obligors and third party security providers (together the “Security Providers”) in every jurisdiction in which the Security Providers are incorporated. In particular: (i) general statutory limitations (including, but not limited to, with respect to the relevant jurisdictions for which guarantee limitation language is set out in Clause 17.9 (Limitation) of this Agreement, such limitations as set out therein), regulatory requirements or restrictions, tax restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation” and “capital maintenance” rules, retention of title claims, employee or works council consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a Security Provider to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the enforcement of the guarantee or security be limited by or to an amount or otherwise; if any such limit applies, the guarantees and security provided will be limited to the maximum amount which the relevant Security Provider may provide having regard to applicable law (including any jurisprudence); additional guarantee limitations may be included in any Obligor Accession Agreement where required in connection with the accession of a new Obligor; (ii) guarantees and security will not be required from or over the shares in, or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement or any person which is neither an Obligor nor a Holding Company of an Obligor; (iii) third party security providers will not be required to provide any guarantees; (iv) the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the cost to the Borrower Group of providing such security (including any increase to the tax and/or regulatory costs of the Borrower Group) so as to ensure that, in the reasonable opinion of UPC Broadband, those costs are proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Finance Parties and the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties, taking into account the level of such stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties, provided that no maximum secured amount may be limited to minimise any taxes imposed pursuant to section 956 of the Code; (v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will, subject to (iv) above, be granted over the material assets only; (vi) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of a Security Provider or under English law, all security (other than share security over its subsidiaries) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Security Provider; (vii) any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by this Agreement and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security document; (viii) if there are third party arrangements in place in respect of any asset, business or person acquired by the Borrower Group (where those third party arrangements were not entered into in contemplation of that acquisition) as a result of which the consent of a third party is required for that acquired person to provide a guarantee or to secure any acquired asset, such guarantee and/ or security will not be required to be granted; (ix) Security Providers will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if that would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their directors or contravene any legal A-214 ----- prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer provided that the relevant Security Provider shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle; (x) the granting of guarantees, perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Finance Documents thereof or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Finance Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection or as otherwise set out in this Schedule; (xi) the granting of guarantees, security or perfection of security will not be required if (1) it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Security Provider to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted or not prohibited by the Finance Documents or (2) it would be either impossible or impractical or would unduly disrupt the business of the relevant Security Provider and, in each such event, a guarantee will not be granted and/or security will not be taken over such assets, as applicable (including, without limitation, notification of such security to any third party); (xii) the Security Agent on behalf of each of the Lenders shall be able, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to enforce the security constituted by the security documents without any restriction from either: (A) the constitutional documents of the relevant Security Provider; (B) any Security Provider which is or whose assets are the subject of such security document (but subject to any inalienable statutory rights which the Security Provider may have to challenge such enforcement); or (C) any shareholders of the foregoing not party to the relevant security document; (xiii) guarantee limitations may mean that access to the assets of a Security Provider for its guarantee is limited, in which case, any asset security granted by that Security Provider shall be proportionate (in terms of liability) to the value of its guarantee; (xiv) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any Excluded Swap Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement); (xv) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Obligors or material assets are not located; (xvi) local law restrictions may mean that the Lenders may not be able to benefit from the same security; and (xvii) the Security Agent will hold one set of security for the Lenders (subject to applicable law). (c) The Security Agent (upon request or instruction, as applicable, in accordance with this Agreement) or the other Finance Parties, as the case may be, shall promptly discharge any guarantees and release any security which is or are subject to any transaction permitted by this Agreement, unless contrary to the Security Principles. 2. **Guarantors and Security (a) To the extent possible and subject to Clause 17 (Guarantee) of this Agreement and the Security Principles, each guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and will be for all liabilities of the Obligors under the Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of Clause 17 (Guarantee) of this Agreement and the Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction and the requirements of local law in each relevant jurisdiction. (b) To the extent possible and subject to Clause 17 (Guarantees and Indemnity) of this Agreement and this Schedule, all security shall be given in favour of the Security Agent and not the Finance Parties individually. “Parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary; such provisions will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security documents unless required under local laws. To the extent possible, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any Lender transfers any of its participation in the Facilities to a new Lender. (c) Security Documents will, to the extent legally possible and subject to this Schedule, incorporate the defined terms used in the Intercreditor Agreement and secure the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) of the relevant Obligor to the secured parties, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, local law requirements and the requirements of this Schedule in each relevant A-215 ----- jurisdiction and, in no circumstances, shall impose any obligation more onerous than those contained in this Agreement other than to the extent required by local law in order to create, enforce or perfect the security interest expressed to be created thereby. (d) Where a Security Provider secures shares, the relevant security document will be governed by the laws of the company whose shares are being charged or pledged and not by the law of the country of the Security Provider. (e) No action will be required to be taken in relation to any guarantee or security where any Lender transfers or assigns any of its participation in the Facilities. The Security Providers will not be liable for any fees, costs, taxes or expenses in relation to any re-registration, re-notarisation or other requirement for perfection or protection of security or guarantees on transfers or assignments by Finance Parties. (f) Any security document shall only be required to be notarised or notarially certified if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence. 3. **Terms of Security Documents The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken subject to due execution of all relevant security documents, completion of all relevant formalities, the reservations or qualifications in the Finance Documents or any legal opinion referred to in Clause 18.4 (Legal Validity) and the application of the Security Principles: (a) the Security Agent shall receive the benefit of: (i) prior to the Asset Security Release Date, the security granted pursuant to the documents listed in Part 2 of Schedule 2 (Condition Precedent Documents); and (ii) on or after the Asset Security Release Date, the security granted pursuant to the Security Documents over: (A) all of the shares in the Obligors held by any member of the Borrower Group or any Obligor; and (B) all of the rights of the relevant creditors in relation to Subordinated Shareholder Loans; and (C) Security over loans made by any Obligor to any other member of the Borrower Group, for the avoidance of doubt: (A) no guarantee or security shall be required to be provided by any person who is not a Security Provider and (B) security shall not be granted over any assets other than as set out in (i) and (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, security in respect of any real property); (b) security will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to any security permitted under the Finance Documents; (c) security will not be enforceable until the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and will be enforceable only subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (a “Declared Default”); (d) any rights of set-off will not be exercisable until the occurrence of a Declared Default; (e) notification of receivables security to debtors (other than intra-group debtors where notice will be given as soon as is reasonably practicable) will only be given if a Declared Default has occurred (subject to local law advice); (f) subject to paragraph (g) below, representations and undertakings shall only be included in each security document to the extent they relate to the security interest or secured assets or any registration or perfection of the security unless otherwise required by local law; (g) the provisions of each security document will not be unduly burdensome on the Security Provider (in relation to the benefit conferred) or interfere materially with the operation of its business and will be limited to those required to create effective security and will not impose commercial obligations and shall not contain additional representations and undertakings (such as in respect of insurance, maintenance of assets, information or the payment of costs) or otherwise repeat any such representations or undertakings given in this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, other than those which are strictly required as a matter of law for the creation and perfection of the security; (h) in the security documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in this Agreement (or the Intercreditor Agreement) including, without limitation, those relating to notices, costs and A-216 ----- expenses, default or penalty interest, indemnities, tax gross up or indemnity, distribution of proceeds and release of security; representations and undertakings shall be included in the security documents only to the extent that they are strictly required by local law for the creation and perfection of the security interest expressed to be created thereby; the security documents will not contain repeating representations; (i) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if, and only to the extent, that they are strictly required by local law to be provided to perfect, enforce or register the security and, when required, shall be provided no more frequently than annually or, following a Declared Default on the Security Agent’s written request; (j) the security documents should not and will not operate so as to prevent transactions which are not prohibited under the other Finance Documents; (k) the secured parties shall only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of a Declared Default or if the relevant Security Provider has failed to comply with a further assurance or perfection obligation within 10 Business Days of being notified of that failure and being requested to comply (provided that in such case, the power of attorney shall be limited to remedying such failure); (l) the Security Agent shall (and is irrevocably authorised and instructed to) promptly enter into and deliver any documentation and/or take such other action as may be required by UPC Broadband to give effect to the Security Principles; (m) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental charges to be delivered in respect of future assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental charges shall be provided at intervals no more frequently than annually, in each case on the Security Agent’s reasonable written request; and (n) each security document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the security document and this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of this Agreement or (as applicable) the Intercreditor Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the relevant security document. 4. **Share Security (a) Subject to the Security Principles the shares in each Obligor shall be secured. (b) The security document will be governed by the laws of the Obligor whose shares are being secured and not by the law of the country of the Security Provider granting the security. (c) Until a Declared Default, the Security Providers will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights to any shares pledged by them in a manner which does not adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the security or cause an event of default to occur and the person whose shares have been pledged will be permitted to pay dividends to each of its shareholders (including the Security Provider) and the relevant Security Provider shall be entitled to receive dividends from such person. (d) Where customary the share certificate and a stock transfer form executed in blank will be provided to the Security Agent, and where required by law the share certificate or shareholders register will be endorsed or written up and the endorsed share certificate or a copy of the written up register provided to the Security Agent, in each case, within 20 Business Days following execution of any security over those shares or the registration of the acquisition of those shares that are subject to such security. (e) Unless the restriction is required by law (or as expressly contemplated in any security document), the constitutional documents of any company the shares in which are subject to security will be amended to remove any restriction on the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement of the security granted over them. (f) The enforcement of security over shares and the acquisition or exercise by the Security Agent of voting rights in respect of shares may be subject to regulatory consent. Accordingly, enforcement of any security over shares and the exercise by the Security Agent of the voting rights in respect of such shares will be expressed to be conditional upon obtaining any consents required by law or regulation and no such consents shall be required to be sought or requested prior to a Declared Default and written request having been made by the Security Agent to UPC Broadband. A-217 ----- 5. **Receivables (a) If a Security Provider grants security over its intercompany receivables or rights in respect of Subordinated Obligations it shall be free to deal with same in the course of its business (provided permitted or not prohibited by this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement) until notified by the Facility Agent following a Declared Default. (b) The perfection of receivables security granted by notification will not be required until the occurrence of a Declared Default other than where such notification is required by applicable law to create security. If such notification is required by applicable law to create security, notice of the security will be served on the relevant counterparties in respect of material intercompany receivables and Subordinated Obligations within 20 Business Days of the security being granted and the Security Provider shall use its commercially reasonable endeavours (not involving the payment of money or incurrence of external expenses) to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the Security Provider has used its commercially reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance its obligation to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance shall cease on the expiry of that 20 Business Day period. (c) Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would prevent the Security Provider from dealing with a receivable in the course of its business (provided permitted or not prohibited by this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement) no notice of security shall be served until required by the Facility Agent following a Declared Default. 6. **Bank Accounts For the avoidance of any doubt, security will not be required to be granted over bank accounts. 7. **Release of Security Unless required by local law, the circumstances in which the security shall be released should not be dealt with in individual security documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be the same as those set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
