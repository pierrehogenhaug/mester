On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. The information set out in relation to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing clearing and settlement arrangements, including the section entitled “Book Entry, Delivery and Form,” is subject to any change in or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream currently in effect.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.

Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those expected in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - the impact of economic conditions and trends in automobile sales and production; - risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic; - the high level of competition in the markets in which we operate; - our ability to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards with respect to regulation, emissions and fuel economy; - legal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the expected exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union; - our ability to keep pace with changes in consumer demand and preferences; - the risk of our OEM customers decreasing production; - the impact of pricing pressure; - the risks associated with warranty claims, product liability and product recalls; - the cost of raw materials and other supplies; - the risk of a significant loss or disruption at our manufacturing facilities; - disruptions in the supply of materials and components that we, our suppliers or our customers use; - our ability to forecast our production requirements and OEM demand; - the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations; - the impact of labor disruptions on our business; - our ability to fund our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations; - our ability to realize the benefits of any acquisitions we make; - our ability to retain key personnel; - the risks associated with doing business globally; - the impact of any failure or disruption to our information technology networks and systems; - the adequacy of our insurance coverage; - risks related to the Offering, our capital structure and the Notes; and - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.” These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity and developments in the markets and ix ----- industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. We urge you to read this entire offering memorandum, including the sections entitled, “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate.

As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer has no material assets or liabilities, does not have any revenue-generating activities of its own and has not engaged in activities since its incorporation other than those related to its incorporation, the lending of its issued share capital to an affiliate and in preparation of the Offering. As a result, no historical financial information of the Issuer is included in this offering memorandum. The Issuer is a direct subsidiary of TI Automotive Limited, which is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of TIFS Holdings Limited, which is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent. The Parent is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of TIFS. Unless otherwise stated, all historical financial information presented in this offering memorandum is that of TI Fluid Systems plc and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Parent and the Issuer. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Group” or “TIFS” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to TIFS and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. TIFS will not be the issuer or a guarantor of the Notes and will not otherwise assume any liability for the Notes, and investors in the Notes will not have any recourse against TIFS in the event of any default by the Issuer or the Guarantors of their respective obligations under the terms of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS (as defined below) requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in the financial statements. In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of our business, the terms of the offering and the financial information. TIFS will not be an issuer or a guarantor of the notes and will not otherwise assume any liability for the notes, and investors in the notes will not have any recourse against TIFS in the event of any default by the Issuer or the Guarantors of their respective obligations under the terms of the notes and the guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.3,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,4.3.1,,"In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not specifically defined under IFRS or recognized under any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear xv ----- on the face of the Financial Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary non-IFRS financial measures used in this offering memorandum include Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, net debt, net leverage, operating profit margin and other figures (the “Non-IFRS Measures”). Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows: - “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for exceptional administration costs, net foreign exchange gains/(losses), net restructuring charges and associate share of profits or losses and dividends received from associates; - “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue; - “Adjusted EBIT” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation, amortization and impairment arising on tangible and intangible assets net of depreciation and amortization arising on purchase price accounting; - “Adjusted EBIT Margin” is defined as Adjusted EBIT divided by revenue; - “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” is defined as Free Cash Flow adjusted for cash movements in financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss, cash payments related to IPO costs, net cashflows relating to restructuring and settlement of derivatives. The restructuring cash adjustment is made to align the treatment of restructuring with the other Adjusted measures and is applied retrospectively; - “Adjusted Net Income” is defined as Profit or Loss for the period attributable to the ordinary shareholders before exceptional items adjusted to reflect associate dividends received and eliminate the impact of net restructuring charges and foreign exchange gains or losses; - “EBITDA” is defined as profit or loss before tax before net finance expense, depreciation, amortization and exceptional impairment of tangible and intangible assets; - “Free Cash Flow” is defined as the total of net cash generated from operating activities and net cash used by investing activities; - “net debt” is defined as the total of current and non-current borrowings excluding lease liabilities, net of cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss; - “net leverage” is defined as net debt divided by last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA; and - “operating profit margin” is defined as operating profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. These Non-IFRS Measures are presented in this offering memorandum because they are measures our management uses to monitor and measure performance of our business and operations and the profitability of our Divisions. Such measures are also utilized by the board of directors of TIFS as targets in determining compensation of certain executives and key members of management, as well as in our communications with investors. We believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. Our Non-IFRS Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of Non-IFRS Measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; xvi ----- - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Financial Statements and using these Non-IFRS Measures only to supplement evaluation of our performance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Exchange rates of the non-euro currencies most relevant to our operations compared to euro that have been applied to constant currency data for the year ended December 31, 2020, are USD: 1.224:1.000; Chinese renminbi: 7.988:1.000 and South Korean won: 1,331:1, which were the exchange rates on December 31, 2020.

Our products include brake and fuel bundles, tank top lines and heating, ventilation and air conditioning lines and components, and powertrain lines and high pressure fuel rails. We are the world’s largest manufacturer of light vehicle brake and fuel lines based on revenue. We produce our own rigid and flexible tubes and design advanced coatings for our specialized tube-based products, which carry brake fluid and fuel (for internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles) within the vehicle. The FCS segment also manufactures thermal fluid management systems, including those used in hybrid electric vehicles (“HEV”), battery electric vehicles (“BEV”) and autonomous electric vehicles (“AEV”), leveraging our existing nylon and lightweight know how, which we believe will result in growth opportunities for our business in excess of growth rates in light vehicle market as our addressable market expands. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 54% of our total revenue from our FCS segment. - **Fuel Tank and Delivery Systems: Our Fuel Tank and Delivery Systems (“FTDS”) segment manufactures plastic fuel tanks, plastic filler pipes and fuel pump and module delivery systems. We hold strong market positions for the majority of our product offerings in our FTDS segment. Our plastic fuel tank and plastic filler pipe products weigh less than similar steel products, which contributes to enhanced fuel economy, and include technology that reduces evaporative emissions. Our FTDS segment is also pursuing expansion in the electric vehicle market, where pressure resistant fuel tanks have the potential to increase our fluid handling content.

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Industry,9.4.1,Reduction of Emissions and Increasing Electrification,"Continued focus on reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency have developed in recent years from a desire to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements into an imperative to take responsibility for helping to create a greener and cleaner environment. As part of the effort to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency, technological innovation in traditional internal combustion engines (“ICE”) has focused on introducing higher pressure fuel systems to help improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions, technology to help reduce evaporative emissions through more efficient fuel tanks and weight reduction techniques, including replacing steel fuel tanks with plastic fuel tanks. In addition to the focus on reduction of emissions from ICE, the industry is also rapidly shifting to alternative powertrain and propulsion technologies through electrification, such as HEV, BEV and AEV. IHS Markit projects CAGRs of 26% and 31% in global HEV and BEV production, respectively, between 2020 and 2027, and that HEVs and BEVs will constitute approximately 38% (compared to 10% in 2020) and 16% (compared to 3% in 2020), respectively, of global vehicle production volumes by 2027. HEVs combine traditional ICE fluid systems, but also have additional fluid handling systems to manage electrification-related component temperatures, including advanced thermal management systems for the chassis, power electronics, electric motor drive and battery systems. As a result, HEVs may have up to six thermal loops (as opposed to the two main thermal management loops in a traditional ICE thermal system). HEV thermal management systems typically include fluid lines and tubes, pumps, quick connectors, sensors and valves. In addition the fuel tank systems for HEVs must accommodate increased fuel vapor pressure, which builds up during the period when the internal combustion engine is not operating and is not available to purge the fuel vapor. BEVs and AEVs are expected to have significantly higher line and tubing content than traditional ICEs, depending on vehicle size, battery size and system design. As thermal components and systems in BEVs and AEVs may not be exposed to the same heat generated by ICEs, the systems in BEVs and AEVs may use different materials, such as nylon, to help optimize system weight, temperature and pressure.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

In 2020, we had 107 manufacturing locations in 28 countries, and exhibited significant regional balance and diversity, with 38% of our revenues in Europe, 35% in Asia and 26% in North America, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2020. No single customer represented more than 13% of our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that this balance and diversification not only protects our revenues and cash flows from exposure to concentration risk, but it also provides us with additional opportunities to expand our collaboration with existing OEM customers in new technologies, such as for HEVs, BEVs and AEVs, or to grow business with new OEM entrants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The market for electric vehicles is expected to grow significantly: IHS Markit projects CAGRs of 26% and 31% in global HEV and BEV production, respectively, between 2020 and 2027, and that HEVs and BEVs will constitute approximately 38% and 16%, respectively, of global vehicle production volumes by 2027. We intend to continue to pursue content expansion in the electric vehicle market where advanced thermal management systems and pressure resistant plastic fuel tanks have the potential to increase our fluid handling products. We expect to be able to leverage our existing nylon and light weight know how and manufacturing capabilities to target key OEMs with thermal management systems that meet the requirements for HEVs, BEVs and AEVs, and to continue increasing our market position in pressure resistant plastic fuel tanks for the increasing HEV market. To that end we are focusing our advanced technology development centers and regional application engineering centers in the ongoing design, development and supply of advanced systems and components on a global basis to OEMs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

As the industry trend of increasing standardization of OEM Platform production continues, we believe that the breadth and scale of our operations, with manufacturing facilities near OEM assembly plants in 107 locations across 28 countries on five continents is a competitive advantage. We see significant opportunities in China, where we generated 23% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as tighter emission standards are leading to higher demand for partial, zero emission and pressure resistant plastic fuel tanks, and we expect to continue to benefit from the conversion of steel to plastic fuel tanks in China.

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Recent Developments,9.10.1,Our Response to COVID-19,"As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, we responded in an agile manner to the fast-changing business conditions. We were one of the first global suppliers to mandate working from home and to implement global travel restrictions. In response to regional outbreaks, we temporarily closed our plants to protect our workers, starting in Asia Pacific and then moving to Europe and North America. However, after several weeks of shutdown, we were able to efficiently and safely re-open our plants by implementing detailed health and safety protocols, such as regular temperature checks and health screening, requiring protective face coverings, social distancing, enhanced cleaning and maintenance procedures, and modified work proximities and altered shift patterns. The health and safety of our workforce was and continues to be our number one priority. We believe that taking decisive action to develop and put these enhanced workplace and manufacturing procedures into practice at all of our facilities around the world greatly limited the impact of COVID-19 infection across our workforce and enabled all of the Group’s production facilities to safely re-open in order to support production for our OEM customers. Thanks to these steps, no COVID-19 infections have to our knowledge been traced to TI Fluid Systems facilities. Global light vehicle production volumes declined significantly, by 16.1%, in 2020—an unprecedented fall due to the impact of COVID-19. The reduction was across all major regions of the world with the deepest decline occurring in the month of April at (61.5)% compared to the same month in 2019. Global production was significantly affected in the first half of the year, with volumes falling by (32.3)% compared to the first half of 2019, and markets started to recover in the second half, with volumes increasing by 0.5% compared to the second half of 2019. In March 2020, our management team implemented aggressive cost reduction and cash preservation measures to safeguard our financial performance and cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2020. These proactive cost management actions included utilizing local government economic support regimes such as furlough and short-term working schemes, 2020 reductions in social costs and rental and utility cost relief. We did not receive any direct loans from national governments. Economic support payments received directly from government authorities amounted to a net €32 million, and any payroll support was fully passed on to employees. Additionally, employment costs totaling €10 million were avoided in 2020 as national governments directly funded these costs to employees. During 2020, short-term employee-agreed salary reductions of €3.7 million helped manage cash costs, though these were repaid during the year. We continue to manage our costs in line with reduced volumes in order to minimize the impact on margins. In the first half of the year ended December 31, 2020, we undertook a full impairment review triggered by the significant change in projected light vehicle volume recovery as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The result of the impairment review was a €304.6 million exceptional impairment charge recognized in the first half of 2020, which, together with conversion of lower sales, drove our operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. In spite of the significantly lower global light vehicle production volumes and uncertainties related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was also another year of strong cash flow performance, where we delivered Adjusted Free Cash Flow of €148.2 million (compared to €180.2 million in 2019). This strong cash performance resulted in our reported cash and cash equivalent balances increasing by €110.6 million (compared to an increase of €48.2 million in 2019) before currency translation and a year-end cash balance of €485.8 million as of December 31, 2020 (compared to €411.7 million as of December 31, 2019). We worked closely with our supply base across the world to manage and support each other throughout the height of the pandemic. During the initial shutdowns, we recognized that some suppliers may struggle to remain in business and were not necessarily equipped to know where to look for support. Upon recognizing this issue, our employees prepared material which was made readily available to our supply base which helped guide them with information on support options that may be available to them in their locations. Following the development of our own COVID-19 protocols designed to reduce the risk of transmission in the workplace, we shared this content with many of our suppliers. We also networked with our vendors to make protective equipment and cleaning supplies available to our suppliers. We also worked to support the communities in which we operate during the pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic in Europe, several of our plants, including Chalons, France, and Tauste an Montornes, Spain, used 8 ----- 3D printers and available resources to manufacture face shields for local hospitals, health centers and elderly residence facilities in their communities. With parts printed on our 3D printers, we assembled these face shields. This effort was very important in providing much-needed personal protective equipment that these facilities could not procure on their own. We donated thousands of face shields at a time when they were not available for purchase, thus helping to keep the people that live and work in our communities safe. In the United States, we are also proud of our collaboration with Ford Motor Company and 3M to produce air flex tube assemblies for powered air-purifying respiratory systems (“PAPR”) which were urgently needed to enable front line healthcare workers to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. The TI team supported the design, engineering and testing to mass produce quick connectors and a new air flex tube solution for the PAPR system. The quick connector and sub-assembly were produced at our New Haven, Michigan, facility, with final tube assembly taking place at our Ashley, Indiana, facility. Keeping production local allowed Ford and 3M to rapidly ramp-up production and supply much-needed protection for healthcare professionals. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains a factor to manage across the regions in which we operate. We continue to monitor the situation and are confident that our enhanced workplace protocols and approaches are effective to assist in managing the impact, which is likely to remain in the short term.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Our EBITDA-based measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our EBITDA-based measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and 18 ----- have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our indebtedness.

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"We have 107 manufacturing locations in 28 countries on five continents, and a substantial amount of our revenue is closely linked to the economic cycle, the general macro-economic environment, automobile sales and production and the trends in product offerings from vehicle manufacturers.","Our customers are primarily OEMs in the automotive industry. Our business is therefore directly related to light vehicle production and automobile sales by our customers, both of which are highly sensitive to the performance of the global economy, macroeconomic factors and other factors outside our control, including trends in light vehicle production. Historically, there has been close correlation between economic growth and global light vehicle production volumes. The cost structure of our business, operating across manufacturing facilities in 107 locations, means that a large reduction in revenue will have an impact on profitability. The trend from the use of the ICE as the predominant vehicle power source towards full electrification of vehicles will continue to necessitate changes in our product portfolio. Consumer demand for automobiles is subject to considerable volatility as a result of general economic conditions, levels of employment, inflation, prevailing wages, levels of disposable income, tax increases, population growth, demographic trends, fuel prices, availability and cost of consumer credit and industrialization in developing countries. Declines in the availability of consumer credit and attractive leasing arrangements and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automobile sales and resulted in lower light vehicle production volume in the past and may do so in the future. Automobile sales and production are highly cyclical. The purchase of an automobile is a significant expense and during economic downturns or periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to refrain from making large purchases and existing automobile owners tend to retain their existing automobiles for longer especially if consumer credit is unavailable or costly. Lower global automobile sales could therefore result in our OEM customers significantly reducing light vehicle production schedules and reducing, delaying or cancelling plans to purchase our products. We may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we or our customers operate, or in which automobiles that incorporate our products are sold. Europe, from which we generated 37% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020, may undergo a renewed economic downturn following the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU or a reemergence of the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. The United States, which accounted for 18% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020, may also undergo a renewed economic downturn or there may be a significant change in trade relations and agreements between the United States and countries in which we operate, such as Mexico. China, which accounted for 23% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020, has recently experienced slower than expected growth and volatility in its financial markets. The economies of emerging markets are susceptible to the prevailing economic conditions in more developed economies and regions, such as North America and Europe. These developments or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Should any of the above risks materialize there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 21 ----- Our sales of products in the regions in which its customers operate ultimately depend on the success of its customers in those regions. If customers are unsuccessful in a particular region or market, this is likely to affect OEM production requirements and therefore OEM demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Global light vehicle production volumes declined significantly, by 16.1%, in 2020—an unprecedented fall due to the impact of COVID-19. The reduction was across all major regions of the world with the deepest decline occurring in the month of April, down by 61.5% compared to the same month in 2019. Global light vehicle production was significantly affected in the first half of the year, with volumes falling by 32.3% compared to the first half of 2019, and markets started to recover in the second half, with volumes increasing by 0.5% compared to the second half of 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or combat the pandemic, have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and the nature, extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing lockdowns, curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings, mandatory remote working, and in some countries, the ability to access manufacturing facilities and office buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Were a recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Any or all such consequences may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our results will depend on the scale, duration, severity and geographic reach of future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Following relaxation of restrictions in the late spring and summer of 2020, further waves of the pandemic have led to renewed restrictive measures including new regional or national lockdowns in several countries in which we operate. Although vaccination programs are being rolled out in many jurisdictions, the pace of vaccination is unclear and the efficacy on large populations is untested. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the length and severity of restrictions on business and individuals, the pandemic’s impact on customers, dealers, and suppliers, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations and demand for vehicles resume, the severity of the current economic downturn, any permanent behavioral changes that the pandemic may cause and any additional actions to contain the spread or mitigate the impact of the outbreak, whether government-mandated or elected by us. The future impact of COVID-19 developments will be greater if the regions and markets that are most profitable for us are particularly affected. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate many of the other risks described in this report, including, but not limited to, the general economic conditions in which we operate, increases in the cost of raw materials and components and disruptions to our supply chain and liquidity. We continue to monitor the situation, and any future mandatory shutdowns, declines in vehicle production or sales or other macroeconomic impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Should we be unable to continue to supply high-quality products within reliable delivery times to OEM customers in the future, such OEM customers could purchase products from our competitors. Our primary competitors include a broad range of international, regional and local companies some of which are focused on particular products or product groups and/or geographical regions. Certain of our competitors may 22 ----- have greater financial, technical and/or marketing resources than we do, which could enhance their ability to finance acquisitions, fund internal growth and/or respond more quickly to technological changes. Our competitors may also foresee and react to the course of market development more effectively than we do, develop products that are superior to our products, produce similar products at a lower cost or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving customer requirements. Our competitors may also have facilities located near an OEM customer where we are not currently present, which would reduce the transportation costs associated with the delivery of products from those facilities to the OEM customer. Increased consolidation among our competitors could allow competitors to further benefit from additional economies of scale, being able to offer more comprehensive product portfolios and increasing the size of the markets they serve. In addition, we face the risk of the entry of new competitors in the markets where we operate, particularly in emerging markets such as China where new entrants may be state-funded and/or where we anticipate that existing market participants will act aggressively to preserve and increase their market share. The entry of new competitors could result in increasing price pressure, reduced margins, higher employee turnover and labor costs and a reduction in our existing market share. Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could result in a reduction in our current market share and competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop sufficient new products or other sources of revenue if certain products become obsolete or if competitors introduce technological advantages that we do not possess. Changing environmental regulations mandating reduced emissions and increased fuel economy for vehicles could also affect demand for certain products. To compete effectively in the automotive supply industry, we must be able to successfully develop and introduce high-quality and innovative products and technologies to meet our customers’ needs in a timely and costeffective manner. We are subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development or production and failure of new products to operate properly. Loss of reputation and customers may also arise if we are not able to develop, produce and deliver products at the high-quality standards our customers expect. Our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to successfully implement technological innovations in design, engineering and manufacturing, which requires extensive investment. Any reduction in investment could reduce our ability to develop and implement technological innovations, which may materially reduce demand for our products. Equally, any investment devoted to the development of new technologies and products that fail to be accepted in the marketplace or that fail to be commercially viable may result in the partial or total loss of such investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to manufacture products for new vehicle or platform programs in time for the start of production or that our customers will execute the launch of their new vehicle or platform programs on schedule for us to supply products.

While the EU and the United Kingdom agreed to comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade pursuant to the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the end of the transition period on that date has, among other things, led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the border, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom and may undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU. Additionally, following the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom will cease to be a member of the EU single market, which will end the free movement of services and workers between the United Kingdom and the EU and may make it more difficult for our United Kingdom operations to do business with customers or suppliers that are based in the EU. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom generated 2% of our sales. The impact of the new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU and the resulting effects on the political and economic future of the United Kingdom, remain uncertain. Economic instability and uncertainty in Europe, has and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

In the future, private and commercial users of transportation may make increased use of modes of transportation other than automobiles. This could be driven by, among other things, rising costs for automotive transport of people and goods (e.g., rising fuel prices, toll fees or vehicle or other taxes), increasing traffic density in major cities and factors relating to environmental protection and growing ecological awareness. Moreover, the number of automobiles sold could decline due to changes in consumers’ long-term behavior, such as increased use of collective transportation (e.g., buses, carpooling, car sharing concepts, rail transport, etc.) and cars losing their appeal as status symbols. In addition, changes in consumer demand driven by the popularity of a particular vehicle type, model, platform or technology such as HEVs and BEVs, may also impact demand for our products.

Although we receive contracts (in the form of purchase orders) from our OEM customers, these contracts generally provide for the supply of an OEM customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model or platform and generally do not provide for the purchase of a specific quantity of our products. The contracts we have entered into with most of our OEM customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the vehicle model or platform (usually five to six years), although OEM customers generally reserve the right to terminate the contract at will (for convenience) with only limited compensation for raw materials, work in process and finished goods. As a result, the revenue to be generated from contracts entered into with our OEM customers is inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties relating to OEM demand and underlying consumer demand for a particular vehicle model or platform that could affect the actual purchase volumes and, correspondingly, the revenue and profitability of our contractual arrangement with an OEM for a specific vehicle model or platform. A significant decrease in consumer demand for key vehicle models or platforms sold by any of our major OEM customers or the ability of an OEM customer to re-source and discontinue purchasing products from us for a particular vehicle model or platform could have a material adverse effect on us. The reduction or loss of business with respect to, or the lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model or platform for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our revenue and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. To the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our key OEM customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because their contracts expire or are terminated for convenience, we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers.

Most OEMs, for example, have annual price reduction initiatives and cost savings objectives with their suppliers. In this regard, our OEM customer supply agreements generally require reductions in the selling prices of our systems and components over the term of a vehicle platform or model. OEMs have leverage over their suppliers, including us, because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive, serves a limited number of OEM customers, has a fixed cost base and at times has had periods of excess capacity. As OEMs may award us significant future business and have a contractual right to terminate their existing supply contracts at will, they have significant leverage in pricing negotiations. Based on these factors, and the fact that our customers’ vehicle programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes, our OEM customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing. These pricing pressures may be increased by any consolidation between our OEM customers as combined OEMs may have greater production volumes and therefore greater purchasing power, in which case corresponding negotiating leverage could increase. Accordingly, we are subject to continuing pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products and expect such pricing pressure to continue in the future as OEMs continue to pursue costcutting initiatives. No assurance can be given that such pricing pressures can be fully offset by reductions in our operating costs or improved operating efficiencies in order to maintain current margins or that our competitors will not be in a better position to react to such pricing pressures. If we are unable to maintain competitive prices for our products, we may not be able to retain existing business or win new business.

We are constantly exposed to the risk of selling and delivering products that do not meet customer requirements or specifications. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our products may not meet customer specifications. This risk can be compounded by the strategy employed by many OEMs to increasingly use standardized parts in different vehicle models and platforms in order to achieve synergies and cost savings, which may increase the risks of such non-compliance occurring across a larger number of vehicles. This could cause us to lose revenue, incur increased warranty and recall costs associated with product testing, repairs and replacement, experience delays, cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products until the cause of the warranty claim has been identified and remedied, experience increased product returns or discounts or even a product recall and suffer damage to our reputation, each of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a product does not meet customer requirements or specifications, an OEM may decide to continue production and replace parts that do not meet its specifications at a later date (at our cost). In addition, our customers could potentially claim damages on the basis of breach of contract even if the relevant product is later replaced. These claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time. In addition, even if we are successful in defending such a claim, claims of this nature could negatively affect OEM customer confidence in us and our products. The causes of warranty issues are sometimes beyond our control. In addition to errors in the design, development, production or handling of our products, components or materials delivered by our suppliers and integrated in our products or manufacturing process may be non-conforming. While there are no material warranty claims pending and while we believe that our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty claims with respect to significant potential warranty matters, our warranty provisions are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to resolve such known potential claims and the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our current estimates and established reserves. If any of our products do not, or are alleged to not, meet customer specifications and are determined to present an unreasonable vehicle safety risk, such products may be subject to recall by the OEM customer. Each of our OEM 25 ----- customers has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers.

Significant changes in the markets in which we purchase materials, components and supplies for the manufacture of our products may adversely affect our profitability, particularly in the event of significant increases in demand for our products where there is no corresponding increase in supply of the raw materials that we use, or in the event of inflation or other pricing increases. The prices of the raw materials used by us, and the raw materials used by our suppliers, have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to be volatile in the future. Furthermore, during periods of declining raw material prices, customers may demand price reductions for our products despite the fact that we may be using existing inventories that were produced with higher raw material and supply costs. This could, in turn, have a negative impact on our profit margins. We do not generally have a contractual right to pass supply and raw material cost increases onto our customers, and although we have had some success in doing so in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Even where we are able to pass on such price increases to the customer, we may not be able to do so on a timely basis. In addition, we may not always be able to substitute any raw materials or other supplies with lower-cost alternatives that still meet customer requirements. Any long-term increase in the cost of our raw materials or other supplies, and resultant increase in the price of our products may ultimately negatively impact demand for our products.

For example, a mechanical failure or disruption affecting any operating line, including any disruption or production capacity constraints resulting from our failure or inability to accurately or effectively manage our manufacturing facilities or changes in our production levels, may result in a disruption in our ability to supply our customers. In early 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was first identified, in response to regional outbreaks, we temporarily closed our plants to protect our workers, starting in Asia Pacific and then moving to Europe and North America. If any of our manufacturing facilities were to be shut down unexpectedly, if certain of our manufacturing operations or equipment and machinery within an otherwise operational facility were to cease production unexpectedly or if we were to fail to accurately or effectively manage our manufacturing facilities or changes in our production levels, there can be no assurance that alternative production capacity would be available or that, if it were available, it could be obtained quickly enough or at the same cost or could be easily transferred. In addition, the loss of systems capability at a facility as a result of IT failure or cyberattack, could impact our ability to operate one or more plants and supply our customers. Injuries arising from health and safety incidents could result in lost time, reduce employee morale and possible changes in working practices. Serious incidents can also have a detrimental impact on our reputation. Operational disruptions and interruptions and process problems, including problems related to start-up issues at facilities or resulting from our failure or inability to accurately or effectively manage changes in our production levels, may lead to significant production downtimes and interruptions to deliveries to OEM customers, which can in turn trigger claims by OEM customers for losses related to assembly shut-down and lost production. While we manufacture our products in numerous facilities and maintain insurance in respect of our facilities, including business interruption insurance, a significant loss of the use of all or a portion of one of our key manufacturing facilities, whether short-term or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 26 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Such disruptions could be caused by, for example, closures of one or more of our supplier’s plants or manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical failures or breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions, political upheaval, pandemics, severe weather, cyberattack, natural or nuclear disasters and delayed customs processing, among other things. Financial difficulties of our major suppliers may also lead to delays in the delivery of raw materials and components. The unavailability, for whatever reason, of any raw material or component required to manufacture one or more of our products could force us to cease production, potentially for a prolonged period. In the event that we have to source raw materials or components from another supplier, a failure of a product to achieve the required quality could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the quality of alternative raw materials or components. In addition, many of our OEM customers have approval rights with respect to the suppliers we use, thereby limiting our ability to source raw materials or components from other suppliers at short notice if the relevant OEM customer has not already approved such other supplier. Failure to replace any of our suppliers on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Even where our products are ready to be shipped, delays may arise before they reach our customers. Our customers may halt or delay their production if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components. This may cause our OEM customers, in turn, to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products. Where an OEM customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time, it is unlikely we will be fully compensated, if at all, for our losses and expenses. If we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations, we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products. Generally, we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up”, such as overtime and premium freight. Additionally, if we are the cause for an OEM customer being forced to halt production, the OEM customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. Any supply-chain disruption, however small, could potentially cause the partial or complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our OEM customers, and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims for compensation, which may include claims for direct and consequential losses such as lost profits and have a negative impact on our relationship with such OEM customer and our reputation more generally. As we have extensive operations in emerging markets, the risk of disruptions in the supply of materials and components that we and our customers use in their products is heightened due to the potential for greater political, economic and social instability, limited transportation infrastructure and difficulties in finding alternative reliable, cost-efficient and qualified suppliers in these regions.

We have underutilized our manufacturing lines in the past and may continue to do so from time to time in the future. We also face challenges estimating production volume and managing production capacity across all of our manufacturing facilities. If we overestimate the volume of products we expect to sell, we will have excess production capacity which would likely reduce the efficiency of production and the margins on the products sold. Our production is bespoke to a particular automotive platform and therefore our products cannot easily be transferred to another production order. In such instances, we may be left with inventory that cannot be sold in the near term. If we underestimate the volume of products we need to produce at any of our facilities, or if we fail to accurately or effectively manage our manufacturing facilities or changes in our production levels, we may be 27 ----- unable to meet customer orders within agreed timeframes. This may occur because existing facilities do not have sufficient capacity, we have insufficient inventory or the costs of transporting goods from one site to another would be uneconomical. As a consequence, we may be required to incur additional costs and pay financial penalties for the late delivery of products to customers. Our OEM customers do not commit to production schedules for the lifetime of the platform or even part of the life of the platform. Our inability to forecast the level of OEM customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity even when a supply contract is in place with an OEM.

Our primary currency exposures are to the Euro, the US Dollar, the Chinese Renminbi and the Korean Won. Net currency exposure from sales or expenses denominated in a foreign currency arises to the extent that we do not incur corresponding or offsetting expenses or sales in the same foreign currency. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in these currencies. We generally seek to mitigate our external transactional currency risk by negotiating revenue and supplier contracts in each operating unit’s functional currency, and also hedge certain residual exposures that are considered highly probable for a period of up to twelve months. In certain jurisdictions, we are restricted in our ability to enter into hedges in excess of specified amounts or time periods, which limits our ability to mitigate transactional currency risk in such jurisdictions. In addition, because the results of operations of some of our operating entities are reported in currencies other than the Euro, we face currency translation risk when such financial results are translated into the Euro at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Currency translation risks also arise in connection with our intra-Group financing activities, such as its intra-Group loans between our subsidiaries in the United States (for which the functional currency is the US Dollar) and the United Kingdom (for which the functional currency is the Euro). Furthermore, because a significant portion of our indebtedness is denominated in US Dollars, we face potential currency risk when our cash from operations in other currencies (including the Euro) is converted into US Dollars in connection with the servicing of our indebtedness. We do not currently hedge against specific entity translation effects of currency fluctuations, which have impacted and will continue to impact our results of operations. Although we put in place in certain hedging arrangements in October 2015 which were primarily related to reducing our foreign currency exposure on our US Dollar based financing facilities, we unwound all of our foreign currency hedges in March 2020.

We operate funded defined benefit pension plans in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. These plans are final salary plans which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The latest valuations for the US, UK and Canadian plans on December 31, 2020, were deficits of €52.3 million and €6 million, and nil respectively. Employer funding contributions to these defined benefit pension plans are agreed at each formal valuation and in the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled €7.8 million. Our defined benefit pension plan contributions for the year ended December 31, 2021 are expected to amount to approximately €4.5 million. Key assumptions used to value our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits, funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on pension assets, the health care cost trend rate and assumptions underlying actuarial methods. If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than the trustees’ assumptions, we may have to contribute additional cash to fund our obligations under these plans. Our ability to satisfy the funding requirements associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations to our current employees and retirees will depend on our cash flow from operations and our ability to access credit and the capital markets. The funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility, including government regulation. The values attributable to the externally invested pension plan assets are subject to fluctuations in the capital markets that are beyond our influence. Unfavorable developments in the capital markets could result in a substantial coverage shortfall for these pension obligations, resulting in a significant increase in our net pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. Any such increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Under the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as amended), the US Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) has the authority to petition a court to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under certain limited circumstances. In the event our pension plans are terminated by the PBGC, we could be liable to the PBGC for the entire amount of the underfunding, as calculated by the PBGC based on our own assumptions (which would likely result in a larger obligation than that based on assumptions we had used to fund such plans). Alternatively, the PBGC could require us to make additional contributions to the plans, thereby reducing the funds available to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Under the Pensions Act 2004, the UK Pensions Regulator may issue a contribution notice requiring contributions to be paid into the relevant plan by an employer in a UK defined benefit plan or any person who is “connected with” or is an “associate of” an employer in a UK defined benefit plan. A contribution notice may be issued if the Pensions Regulator is of the opinion that (i) the relevant person has been a party to an act, or a deliberate failure to act, which had as its main purpose (or one of its main purposes) the avoidance of pension liabilities or (ii) the relevant person has been a party to an act, or a deliberate failure to act, which has a materially detrimental effect on a pension plan without sufficient mitigation having been provided.

Increasing our manufacturing footprint in Asian markets, including China, and our business relationships with Asian OEMs are important elements of our strategy as is expanding our manufacturing footprint in other emerging markets. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future as we expand our business in these regions.

We are also subject to the risk that competitors will engage in unauthorized copying of our production and process know-how, resulting in us potentially losing technology leadership and advantages. The risks of such unauthorized copying are especially high in certain markets outside Western Europe and the United States, including China and India. Such infringements and copying of know-how, if they relate to a sufficiently critical, or a sufficient number of, rights, products or processes, could lead to significant losses of revenue or goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Certain environmental laws impose liability, sometimes regardless of fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third-party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the adoption of emission control regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate manufacturing facilities could require the implementation of further environmental, health and safety and other measures that could be costly, and could also impact utilization rates and increase the amount we spend annually on energy. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future and our costs of complying with current and future environmental laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future practices or facilities, will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Term Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. 37 ----- In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able effectively to enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions of organization of the Issuer and the Guarantors not organized in the United States may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes Guarantees in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The Issuer is organized under the laws of England and Wales, the Guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States, England and Wales, Germany, Canada, Belgium and Poland. With respect to any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union (such as Germany, Belgium and Poland), there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Parent’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer and the enforceability of a Notes Guarantee against a Guarantor. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Notes Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Notes Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee; 39 ----- - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Notes Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, _capital maintenance and other limitations on the Notes Guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Notes Guarantees were issued, the Guarantor: - issued such Notes Guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such Notes Guarantee after its insolvency; - issued such Notes Guarantee in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary of the Notes Guarantee knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Notes Guarantee on the basis that the Notes Guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes Guarantee, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Notes Guarantee if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that both the Issuer and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Notes Guarantees were issued or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Notes Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the relevant Guarantor. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to 40 ----- fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Notes Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Notes Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Notes Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Notes Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. The Notes Guarantees granted by the Guarantors organized in Germany, Belgium and Poland will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so-called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture, which is designed to ensure compliance with these rules and any other general statutory laws or risks for directors. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Notes Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Notes Guarantee cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Notes Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Notes Guarantees apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor.

After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests.

As such, global light vehicle production volumes are the principal driver of our performance, and our revenues are generally closely correlated with global light vehicle production volumes. Historically, our revenue, while correlated with global light vehicle production volumes, has trended toward outperformance of growth, excluding currency movements, and we seek to continue that trend across all regions. Light vehicle production has historically exhibited cyclicality over multi-year periods, with varying cyclicality across customers, regions and platforms. We believe that our highly diverse customer base, global manufacturing footprint and flexible cost structure provide us with a natural hedge against this sort of cyclicality. Light vehicle production is also responsive to global macroeconomic forces and macro-trends, such as the development of China and other emerging economies. Light vehicle production declined significantly during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, and an in the year ended December 31, 2020, was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global light vehicle production volumes declined significantly by 16.1% in 2020 to 74.6 million vehicles—an unprecedented fall due to the impact of COVID-19. The reduction was across all major regions of the world with the deepest decline occurring in the month of April at (61.5)% compared to the same month in 2019. Global production was significantly affected in the first half of the year, with volumes falling by (32.3)% compared to the first half of 2019, and markets started to recover in the second half, with volumes increasing by 0.5% compared to the second half of 2019. As a result, we saw revenues decrease by €532.3 million, or 15.9%, on a constant currency basis compared to 2019. To the extent global light vehicle production increases, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from this growth based on our strong customer relationships, technological innovation and consistent product quality, delivery and service. In particular, as the industry shifts away from ICEs toward HEVs, BEVs and AEVs, we see a significant opportunity to grow our business.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The COVID-19 pandemic drove the significant decrease in global light vehicle production described above impacting our revenues, and inefficiencies in the production process due to lower and inconsistent volumes and COVID-19-related working protocols such as additional cleaning and social distancing measures. In the first half of the year ended December 31, 2020, we undertook a full impairment review triggered by the significant prolonged recovery of global light vehicle production volumes and forecast cash flows projected at that time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The result of the impairment review was a €304.6 million exceptional impairment charge recognized in the first half of 2020, which, together with conversion of lower sales, drove our operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, projected market volume outlook and to strengthen our business performance in the future, we incurred restructuring charges of €16.1 million related to permanent headcount reductions across all our businesses and the planned closure and downsizing of eight of our manufacturing plants in Europe, North America and Latin America. We targeted cash expenditures relating to this restructuring of €17 million in 2020 and are targeting €30 million in 2021. We are targeting savings in 2022 of an estimated €74 million and cumulative savings through 2022 of approximately €94 million as part of these cost savings programs. We also undertook active cost management actions in the year, including utilizing local government economic support regimes, including the use of furlough and short-term working schemes, 2020 reductions in social costs and rental and utility cost relief. Economic support payments received direct from government authorities amounted to a net €32 million, with any and all payroll support fully passed on to employees. Additionally, employment costs totaling €10 million were avoided during the year ended December 31, 2020, as national governments directly funded these costs to employees. 52 ----- We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to be a factor in our results of operations in the near future.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

As part of the effort to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency, technological innovation in traditional ICE vehicles has focused on introducing higher pressure fuel systems to help improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions, technology to help reduce evaporative emissions through more efficient fuel tanks and weight reduction techniques, including replacing metal components (such as fuel tanks) with plastic fuel tanks. However, the focus on reduction of emissions is also rapidly shifting to developing alternative powertrain and propulsion technologies through electrification, such as HEVs, BEVs and AEVs. IHS Markit projects CAGRs of 26% and 31% in global HEV and BEV production, respectively, between 2020 and 2027, and that HEVs and BEVs will constitute approximately 38% (compared to 10% in 2020) and 16% (compared to 3% in 2020), respectively, of global vehicle production volumes by 2027. HEVs combine traditional ICE fluid systems, but also have additional fluid handling systems to manage electrification-related component temperatures, including advanced thermal management systems for the chassis, power electronics, electric motor drive and battery systems. As a result, HEVs may have up to six thermal loops (as opposed to the two main thermal management loops in a traditional ICE thermal system). HEV thermal management systems typically include fluid lines and tubes, pumps, quick connectors, sensors and valves. In addition the fuel tank systems for HEVs must accommodate increased fuel vapor pressure, which builds up during the period when the internal combustion engine is not operating and is not available to purge the fuel vapor. BEVs and AEVs are expected to have significantly higher line and tubing content than traditional ICEs, depending on vehicle size and system design. As thermal components and systems in BEVs and AEVs may not be exposed to the same heat generated by ICEs, the systems in BEVs and AEVs may use different materials, such as nylon, to help optimize system weight, temperature and pressure. We believe that an optimized ICE and HEV contains content supplied by us in an amount in the range of €250-€700 per vehicle, while a traditional ICE contains €200 of content per vehicle. We have seen our average content per vehicle grow from €120 per vehicle in 2018 to €135 per vehicle in 2020. We believe we are well-positioned to win new business and grow our existing business in connection with this trend of reduced emissions and increased fuel efficiency.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Prior to 2000, the more developed markets of North America, Western Europe, South Korea and Japan accounted for a substantial majority of global light vehicle production. However, since 2000, global light vehicle production growth has largely been driven by emerging markets and, in particular, China, where light vehicle production volume grew at a CAGR of 13.5% between 2000 and 2020. According to IHS Markit, approximately 31% of global light vehicle production in 2020 was generated in China, with growth expected to continue in the long-term. The more developed markets are expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.6%, with an increase of approximately 6.8 million units from 2020 to 2027, while emerging markets are forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5.3% with an increase of 17.6 million units during the same period.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

While operating units typically quote business in the same currency as the associated costs, there are exceptions and, additionally, there are instances where the transaction impact is not fully offset. Our results of operations are also influenced by currency translation, as the results of operating units are ultimately consolidated in Euros. We do not hedge against the translation effects of currency fluctuations, thus exchange rate fluctuations may impact the reporting of the financial results of a subsidiary even though no change in its results of operations has occurred. For further information see “Risk Factors—We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate _fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations, which may adversely affect our financial results.”_ The Group records revenue through product sales in a variety of currencies, including Euros, US Dollars, Chinese Renminbi and Korean Won. These currencies are also the most significant currencies for the Group’s cost of sales. Fluctuations in the value of the various currencies in which the Group operates, and the US Dollar and Chinese Renminbi in particular, against the Euro have affected the Group’s results of operations. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Euro appreciated against the US dollar and other key currencies, which had a negative impact on the Group’s reported revenue, resulting in a net adverse impact of €64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Group generally seeks to mitigate its external transaction risk by negotiating revenue and supplier contracts in each operating unit’s functional currency. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage much of the residual transactional currency risk. In March 2020, the Group terminated all its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash flow hedge relationships, its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in net investment hedges, and all its interest rate swaps. Most of the instruments terminated in March had original maturity dates of October 2020. Due to the market fluctuations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group decided to crystallize these asset positions and convert them to cash. The Group realized cash proceeds of €15.9 million on termination of these derivatives and in total received €16.6 million in the year from these arrangements. 54 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Our EBITDA-based measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. Our EBITDAbased measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to service our indebtedness.

This decrease was driven primarily by the COVID-19 pandemic and the historic decrease in global light vehicle production and the negative impact of currency exchange rates of €64.2 million. Excluding the negative impact of currency exchange rates, our decline in revenues was broadly in line (0.2% outperformance) with the declines in global light vehicle production during the period. The net adverse impact of currency exchange rates was mostly due to strengthening of the Euro against the US dollar and other key currencies in countries where we have manufacturing operations. 57 ----- _Revenues by region_ The table below sets forth our revenues by region and period percentage of change for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

This slight underperformance was driven by the ramp down of some programs which offset the benefit of the successful launch of new HEV/ BEV programs for both FTDS and FCS. In the region we aligned with our customers production shut downs and temporarily ceased operations in our factories to minimize risk to employee well-being and also control costs. The volume recovery in the second half of the year was tempered by the activity impact of subsequent waves of the pandemic. In Asia Pacific, revenue decreased by €48.1 million, or 2.5% at constant currency, year over year, to €982.5 million, compared to light vehicle production decline of 11.3%, for a strong outperformance of 8.8%. We generated 23% (2019: 19%) of its total revenue in China, benefiting from our long-standing market position in our brake and fuel lines business within our FCS division and continued growth in fuel tank business within the FTDS division. The high market share for FCS in China meant that revenue was more impacted by the general volume decline in China, whereas FTDS continues to benefit from successful business launches of conventional plastic fuel tanks and HEV pressure resistant fuel tanks and this segment enjoyed double digit year over year growth. In North America, revenue decreased by €222.0 million, or 22.2% at constant currency, year over year, to €714.7 million, compared to light vehicle production decline of 20.2%, a 2.0% underperformance. The main impact for this region was program ramp downs in the FCS division, and the continued impact of our lower share of the popular large truck/SUV platforms. _Revenues by segment_ The table below sets forth our revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, at actual and constant currency exchange rates. FCS revenue declined by €390.7 million, or 18.4% at constant currency, from the prior year to €1,526.9 million, an underperformance of 2.3% when compared to global light vehicle production. The FCS revenue performance is driven by unfavorable regional mix, with powertrain program ramp downs in North America region offsetting the benefit of successful launches of thermal programs in Europe and Asia Pacific. FTDS revenue decreased by €205.9 million, or 12.7% at constant currency, to €1,287.6 million, outperforming global light vehicle production by 3.4%. This performance is heavily influenced by outperformance of 0.5% and 16.9% in Europe and Asia Pacific, respectively, which account for over 80% of FTDS sales in 2020. Notably our sales in Asia Pacific saw positive growth over 2019 at constant currency of 5.6%, reflecting the benefits of program launches and ramp ups in China and Korea and favorable mix. 58 ----- _Total cost of sales_ Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €309.2 million, or 10.6%, compared to cost of sales of €2,922.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was the result of lower activity due to the decrease in demand as a result of COVID-19 and the reduction in light vehicle production and active cost management actions throughout the year, which included the use of furlough and short-term working schemes and direct funding of certain employment costs by national governments, which was partially offset by a €120.4 million exceptional impairment of intangible assets, PP&E and lease right-of use assets as a result recognized in the first half of 2020 following an impairment review triggered by the significant change in projected volumes and forecast cash flows projected at that time. _Distribution costs_ Distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by €11.3 million, or 11.9%, to €83.7 million, compared to distribution costs of €95.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of lower activity due to decrease in demand as a result of COVID-19 and the reduction in light vehicle production. _Total administrative expenses_ Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by €187.6 million, or 132.4%, to €329.3 million, compared to administrative expenses of €141.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of the impact of an exceptional impairment charge to goodwill of €184.2 million recognized in the first half of 2020 following an impairment review triggered by the significant change in projected volumes and forecast cash flows projected at that time. _Net foreign exchange gains_ Net foreign exchange gains recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by €26.7 million to €27.2 million, compared to €0.5 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019. These gains primarily relate to gains on the Group’s unhedged US dollar denominated intercompany borrowings in Euro functional currency companies. These arose after March 2020, following termination of all the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash flow hedge relationships. _Net finance expense_ Net finance expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by €16.5 million, or 28.7%, to €74.0 million, compared to net finance expense of €57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was a result of a hedge ineffectiveness loss of €7.1 million from the early close out of certain cash flow hedges at the end of March 2020, as part of the Group’s cash preservations measures (compared to €0.2 million in 2019), which also gave rise to €1.3 million fair value net gains on derivatives and foreign exchange contracts not in hedged relationships (compared to €10.2 million in 2019). The Group realized cash proceeds of €15.9 million on termination of these derivatives and in total received €16.6 million in the year from these arrangements. _Income tax (expense)/credit_ Income tax for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a credit of €1.6 million, compared to an expense of €57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2019 Group income tax charge, €57.1 million, was favorably impacted by the €12.2 million prior year tax credit recognized in respect of the US Research & Experimentation claims. Group profit before tax after adjusting for the impact of the Group’s share of associate after tax profits and losses, €3.5 million losses (2019: €0.3 million profits), amounted to €54.3 million (2019: €201.4 million). Normalizing 2019 for the €12.2 million prior year tax credit, the 2020 and 2019 effective tax rates were 51.7% and 34.4%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we are reporting an exceptional impairment charge of €304.6 million with a deferred tax benefit of €29.7 million which results in an exceptional effective tax rate of 9.8%. The low exceptional effective tax rate is due to the fact that the majority of the impairment is related to goodwill that does not carry a deferred tax balance and therefore this portion of the impairment is not tax effected. Our income tax charge, before exceptional items, for the year ended December 31, 2020, was €28.1 million, a decrease of €29.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This reduction results in an increase in 59 ----- the Effective Tax Rate to 55.3% (2019: 28.3%) on Group Profit Before Tax of €50.8 million. Adjusting for the one-off effect of the 2019 €12.2 million tax credit associated with the US Research and Experimentation claim and the impact of accounting for associates on an after tax basis, the 2020 Effective Tax Rate is 51.7% (2019: 34.4%). The unusually high effective tax rate is reflective of the mix effect of the significant drop in the level of profits generating a tax charge and a stable level of losses where no deferred tax asset is recognized. The effective tax rate for those entities which are ordinarily subject to tax or where deferred tax assets are recognized is broadly consistent year on year, 24.6% (2019: 26.4%), despite the fall in the absolute level of net profits. The level of losses not subject to a tax charge was €38.7 million (2019: €36.0 million). The 2020 Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is 42.6% (2019: 32.3%).

The major impact on Adjusted EBITDA during the period was lower operating profit as a result of conversion on lower revenue, partially offset by reduction in overhead costs as a result of cost saving measures in response to COVID-19. We continue to manage our costs in line with the reduced volumes in order to minimize the impact on margins. The €16.1 million net restructuring charges comprised €19.5 million in respect of headcount reduction actions, plant closure and downsizing with an associated headcount reduction of 1,059 offset by a €3.4 million gain arising from the land and building disposals associated with plant closure actions. By region, the restructuring charges borne in Europe (€12.4 million), Latin America (€2.0 million), Asia Pacific (€1.5 million) and North America (€3.6 million) were offset by the land and building disposal gains in North America (€3.4 million). The segmental impact to FCS and FTDS was €7.0 million and €9.1 million respectively. At the end of 2020 there was a restructuring provision of €11.0 million, compared to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Adjusted EBIT_ Adjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by €167.1 million, or 49.1%, to €173.3 million, compared to €340.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was impacted by lower Adjusted EBITDA as described previously. During the year there were program specific impairment charges of €9.2 million, compared to €3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, consisting of €2.9 million in FCS and €6.3 million in FTDS. Adjusted EBIT margin was 6.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. By segment, FCS Adjusted EBIT was €97.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to €199.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, with an Adjusted EBIT margin of 6.4% (2019: 10.4%). FCS continues to achieve positive margins despite the prevailing market environment. The year over year decline in margin reflects the volume reduction, particularly in Europe and North America. Asia Pacific margin remained strong as the region recovered earlier from factory shutdowns when compared to other regions. The 2019 Adjusted EBIT included €12.0 million benefit arising from the US pensions settlement and Brazilian indirect tax compensation, and was only partially repeated in 2020 from a further US pension settlement amounting to €1.6 million. FTDS Adjusted EBIT decreased by €64.9 million to €76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to €141.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, with Adjusted EBIT margin of 5.9% (2019: 60 ----- 9.4%). The decrease in margin reflects the conversion of the significantly reduced revenues as a result of COVID-19. Asia Pacific margin remained strong, benefiting from new business launches in the fuel tanks business. The 2019 Adjusted EBIT included €1.9 million benefit arising from the US pensions settlement which was only partially repeated in 2020 from the further US pension settlement amounting to €0.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Global light vehicle production has a significant influence on our performance. In 2019, global light vehicle production decreased by 5.6% to 88.9 million vehicles compared to the prior year. Our revenue continued to outperform global light vehicle production, exceeding the global light vehicle production change by 2.1% in 2019.

Europe and Africa light vehicle production declined by 5.9%. Revenue outperformance was primarily due to new business launches and favorable program ramp up impacts, particularly in FTDS, offset by lower volumes in FCS. 61 ----- In Asia Pacific, revenue decreased by €1.6 million, or 1.5% at constant currency, year over year, to €1,030.6 million, and outperforming light vehicle production in the region by 4.7%. Asia Pacific light vehicle production declined by 6.2%. The weakness in light vehicle production was most notable for us in China, where we have longstanding market position in our brake and fuel lines business within our FCS segment. Accordingly, FCS revenue was impacted by the volume declines in China during the year ended December 31, 2019. Despite this we continued to outperform in the region, primarily through continued new business success with our fuel tanks in FTDS in China where the Group is benefiting from the automotive megatrends of reduced evaporative emissions and fuel efficiency, driven by the ongoing switch from steel to plastic fuel tanks. In North America, revenue decreased by €35.2 million, or 8.6% at constant currency, year over year, to €936.7 million, or 4.7% below light vehicle production volume. North America light vehicle production declined by 3.9%. Revenue was impacted by OEM program relocations to Europe and China as well as mix, with the Group’s lower exposure to SUVs and light truck programs in this region. _Revenues by segment_ The table below sets forth our revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. FCS revenue declined by €109.1 million, or 7.2% at constant currency, from the prior year to €1,917.6 million. The FCS revenue performance was particularly impacted during the year ended December 31, 2019 by lower production in China and mix in North America. FTDS revenue increased by €47.4 million, or 1.6% at constant currency, to €1,493.5 million. FTDS revenue continued to benefit from new wins in Asia Pacific and resilient performance in Europe. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by €15.5 million, or 0.5%, to €2,922.7 million, compared to cost of sales of €2,938.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was the result of reduced trading activities on lower revenue and active cost management, partially offset by increases resin costs. _Distribution costs_ Distribution costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by €7.4 million, or 7.2%, to €95.0 million, compared to distribution costs of €102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was the result of reduced trading activities on lower revenue and reductions in overhead costs. _Administrative expenses_ Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by €22.8 million, or 13.9%, to €141.7 million, compared to administrative expenses of €164.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by reversals of higher costs and charges incurred in prior years that were reversed by receipt of a settlement gain and lower payroll costs. _Net finance expense after exceptional items_ Net finance expense after exceptional items for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by €7.0 million, or 10.9%, to €57.5 million, compared to net finance expense after exceptional items of €64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily the result of the full-year impact of the interest savings following repayment of our 8.75% senior notes in July 2018 and a loan repayment in March 2019, as well as exceptional finance costs incurred in repayment of such senior notes in July 2018 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2020. 62 ----- _Income tax (expense)/credit_ Income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by €19.9 million, or 25.8%, to €57.1 million, compared to income tax expense of €77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Income tax expense before exceptional items was €57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to €77.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents an Effective Tax Rate of 28.3% (2018: 35.5%). The tax expense was €19.9 million lower than 2018 due to an overall decrease in taxable profits, and the €12.2 million net benefit arising from the completion of a prior year related Research & Experimentation claim in the US. Recognition of this claim favorably impacts the Effective Tax Rate by 5.2%. The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, which was calculated by adjusting for the impact of UK losses where no tax relief is available, and prior year tax movements, including the Research & Experimentation benefit, was 32.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 32.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This remained largely consistent with the prior year as the global mix of profits and territories in which the Group operated remained broadly the same.

Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 14.6%, compared to 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was the result of the impact of adopting IFRS 16, which had a €37.2 million benefit to Adjusted EBITDA due to the reversal of operating lease charges, partially offset by lower operating profit as a result of lower revenue. _Adjusted EBIT_ Adjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by €33.1 million, or 8.9%, to €340.4 million, compared to €373.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Adjusted EBIT margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 10.0%, compared to 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. This change in Adjusted EBIT was impacted by conversion on lower revenue, partially offset by reductions in overhead costs and the adoption of IFRS 16. We continue to manage our costs in line with the reduced volumes in order to minimize the impact on margins. Depreciation relating to right-of-use assets recognized as part of IFRS 16 accounted for €31.5 million of the increase in the depreciation and impairment charge of PP&E. By segment, FCS Adjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by €41.6 million, or 17.3%, to €199.4 million, compared to €241.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, with an Adjusted EBIT margin of 10.4% (2018: 11.9%). FCS achieved double digit margins despite difficulties in the prevailing market environment. The year over year decline in margin reflected the volume reduction particularly in China, where we have a high market share, as well as increases in resin costs. FTDS Adjusted EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €8.5 million, or 6.4%, to €141.0 million, compared to €132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, with Adjusted EBIT margin of 9.4% (2018: 9.2%). The increase in margin reflects the benefits of mix and strong operational performance in FTDS during 2019. 63 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash generated from operations as a result of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in light vehicle production in the first half of 2020, and was partially mitigated by a decrease in interest and income tax paid compared to that in the year ended December 31, 2019. 64 ----- For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash generated from operating activities was €334.4 million, an increase of €37.4 million, or 13%, compared to net cash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in cash generated from operations in part and a decrease in income tax paid compared to that in the year ended December 31, 2018. _Cash flows from investing activities_ For the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used by investing activities was €95.4 million, a decrease of €61.6 million, or 39%, compared to net cash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Development expenditure is capitalized where the costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and we intend to and have sufficient resources to complete the project and to use or sell the development asset. Expenditure capitalized includes the cost of materials, direct labor, and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Payments associated with exempt leases are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement. We first applied IFRS 16 “Leases” on January 1, 2019, in accordance with the simplified transition (modified retrospective) approach permitted in the standard, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized on that date. All lease liabilities recognized on the balance sheet (“non-exempt leases”), were initially measured at the present value of their remaining lease payments, discounted using our incremental borrowing rates as of January 1, 2019. All right-of-use assets existing at that date were initially measured at the amount of the lease liability after adjusting for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses. Since January 1, 2019, a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability has been recognized for all new non-exempt leases at the date at which the underlying leased assets are made available for our use discounted using our incremental borrowing rate at that date. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: - fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; - variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; - the exercise price of a purchase option if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option; and - payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs, and restoration costs. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within our control. After initial recognition, lease interest payable is charged to the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured when there is a change in the future lease payments due under a lease, due to a change in the lease term or fixed lease payments under the lease, including changes in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. A corresponding adjustment is also made to the right-of-use asset. Lease liabilities are remeasured at our incremental borrowing rates at the date of the change, except where changes in lease payments result from a change in an index or a rate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, other than financial assets and financial liabilities at “fair value through profit or loss” (“FVTPL”), are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are expensed as incurred. _Financial Assets_ Financial assets are classified into “financial assets at amortized cost” and “financial assets at FVTPL.” The classification is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on our business model for managing the financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. 69 ----- Financial assets at amortized cost Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss. Our financial assets at amortized cost comprise “trade and other receivables excluding prepayments” and “cash and cash equivalents.” Financial assets at FVTPL A financial asset is classified in this category if it does not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial asset at amortized cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. These contracts are marked to market by re-measuring them to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the balance sheet, when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Impairment of financial assets We recognize a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets at amortized cost. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. For trade receivables and contract assets, we recognize expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument “lifetime ECL.” A default on a financial asset occurs when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 180 days of when they fall due. We also assess on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the trade receivables. For all other financial instruments, we recognize lifetime ECL only when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, we measure the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, we compare the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, we consider an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external credit rating where available; significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument, e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread or the credit default swap prices for the debtor, indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in payments, an increase in the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy, or other financial reorganization, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. _Financial Liabilities_ Financial liabilities are classified as either “financial liabilities at amortized cost” or “financial liabilities at FVTPL.” Financial liabilities are recognized initially on the date at which we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities at amortized cost The classification of financial liabilities at amortized cost is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on our business model for managing the financial liabilities and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. 70 ----- Financial liabilities at amortized cost, including borrowings and trade and other payables excluding deferred income and lease liabilities, are measured using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortized cost of a financial liability and allocates interest expense over its term. The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments (including all issuance discounts and transactions costs), through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Borrowings, including extensions to existing agreements, are recognized initially at fair value, net of discounts and transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortized cost. Any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Interest arising on financial instruments is recognized on an accruals basis. In assessing whether a debt alteration is to be treated as a modification or an extinguishment and new arrangement, an evaluation is made of the qualitative factors such as the underlying parties to the transaction and quantitative factors such as the impact on the net present value of remaining cash flows. A gain or loss is recognized immediately in the income statement at the date of the extinguishment of a financial liability. Financial liabilities at FVTPL A financial liability is classified in this category if it does not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial liability at amortized cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. We enter into conventional derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risks, mostly foreign exchange forward contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 28 to the Financial Statements. Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into, and are subsequently marked to market by re-measuring to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.

Derivatives are initially recognized at their fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each balance sheet date. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. In March 2020, we terminated all our forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash flow hedge relationships, our forward foreign exchange contracts designated in net investment hedges, and all our interest rate swaps. Prior to this date, we designated certain derivatives as either: - Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge); and - Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). At the inception of a hedging transaction, we documented the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. We also documented our assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that were used in hedging transactions were effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Our cost of hedging, the time value of options and forward element of forward contracts were initially recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to profit and loss over time. _Cash flow hedges_ We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and, prior to March 2020, variability in cash flows relating to US dollar borrowings. We also used interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk arising from its borrowings, which fixed the interest rate for a portion of the borrowings. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting were recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion was recognized immediately within finance income or expense in the income statement. 71 ----- When hedge accounting was discontinued for these cash flow hedges, the amount that had been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve was treated as follows: (i) if the hedged future cash flows for the US dollar borrowings were still expected to occur, that amount remained in the cash flows hedge reserve until the future interest or borrowings cash flows occur, or until that amount was a loss, and it was expected that all, or a portion of that loss, would not be recovered in one or more future period. In those circumstances, the amount that was not expected to be recovered was immediately transferred to finance income or expense in the income statement as a reclassification adjustment. (ii) if the hedged future cash flows for the US dollar borrowings were no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the cash flow hedge reserve was immediately transferred to finance income or expense in the income statement as a reclassification adjustment. _Net investment hedges_ Prior to March 2020, hedges of net investments in foreign operations were accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument, relating to the effective portion of the hedge, was recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion was recognized in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The fair values of derivatives, which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, are classified as current assets or liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Revenue in the course of ordinary activities is measured and recognized using the five-step approach outlined in IFRS 15: 1. Identify the contract with the customer 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract 3. Determine the transaction price 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 5. Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies the performance obligations _Step 1:_ To be recognized as a contract, there must be appropriate approval from both parties and clear identification of each party’s rights under the agreement. The payment terms should be evident, with collection of consideration probable. Our customer arrangements take a variety of forms, with typical contractual frameworks comprising: master terms and conditions, program award letters, purchase orders and release orders. For piece part revenue, volume requirements and mutually enforceable terms are established on the customer issuance of a release order and therefore this is the relevant accounting unit of contract. Tooling, prototype and development (“TPD”) requirements are typically specified in a purchase order or equivalent. _Step 2:_ The performance obligation within a piece part release order is to manufacture and deliver the specified volume of requested parts. The performance obligation of a TPD order is to construct or undertake the relevant tooling and development activities. Where the different obligations are separable, in terms of both capability and within the contractual documentation, they are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Further details regarding the nature of goods and services sold is included in Note 2 to the Financial Statements. 72 ----- _Step 3:_ The fair value of consideration receivable is the transaction price specified in the relevant release order or purchase order, net of returns, discounts, sales taxes and volume rebates. For piece part revenue, the price is fixed at the given release order (contract) and does not include any element of variable consideration. For TPD revenue, where there is any uncertainty over the amount of consideration that will ultimately be recognized, the transaction price is constrained until such uncertainty is resolved. Amounts invoiced in excess of the transaction price will be reflected as pricing accruals or revenue deferrals. _Step 4:_ The transaction price established in step 3 is allocated to the distinct performance obligations identified in step 2. _Step 5:_ Revenue is recognized on satisfaction of the specified performance obligations, consistent with the passing of control of the goods and services. For piece part revenue, control is deemed to have passed at the point in time delivery of the parts specified in the applicable release order is made. Where consignment arrangements apply, revenue is only recognized when control of the underlying inventory has passed to the customer. For TPD activities, control is deemed to have passed once production part approval process or start of production has been achieved, depending on the specific terms of the agreement. Costs incurred up until this point are recognized as work-in-progress on the balance sheet and reviewed regularly for impairment should their future recovery become doubtful. Upfront deposits and progress billings are recorded in deferred revenue, until point of recognition. _Contract Costs_ Incremental costs incurred in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized over the applicable program life, with regular review for impairment. Other pre-contract costs and costs of fulfilment are expensed as incurred unless future economic benefit is evident, or if applicable, within the scope of other standards. _Impairment_ Contract assets arise where a performance obligation has been satisfied but amounts due have not been fully recognized within trade receivables.

A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under bonus plans if we have a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount because of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably. _Defined contribution plan_ Payments to a defined contribution retirement benefit plan are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which we may elect to pay discretionary and fixed contributions to a separate trust and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts in respect of past service. _Defined benefit plan_ A defined benefit plan provides an amount of benefit that an employee will receive at a later date, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, periods of service and compensation. Our defined benefit arrangements include funded and unfunded pension plans, post-employment healthcare, statutory termination indemnities and long-service awards. The liability recognized in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (“DBO”) at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. Where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the DBO, an asset is recognized only to the extent of future economic benefits accruing to us either as cash refunds or as a reduction in contributions. The service cost of providing benefits for funded plans accruing during the year and any past service costs are charged as an operating expense. The interest cost or credit arising from the unwinding of the discount on the net actuarial liability or asset is recognized in the income statement as finance expense or income. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. The DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related benefit obligation. _Defined benefit plans – funded_ We operate funded pension plans in the US, Canada and UK. The US plans are subject to annual actuarial review, while the others are formally valued at least triennially. Assets are held in trusts and are separately administered from our activities. Assets include readily marketable equities, credit and diversified growth/multistrategy funds, and qualifying insurance policies, and are valued at fair value. We make contributions based on actuarial advice sufficient to meet the liabilities of the plans. _Defined benefit plans – unfunded including healthcare_ We operate unfunded employment benefit plans in certain countries of which the most significant are postemployment healthcare in the US, a closed arrangement, and pension plans in Germany. Other liabilities include statutory termination indemnities and long-service awards.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income and equity. _Current tax_ Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. _Uncertain tax positions_ We operate in many jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude. Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions, which 74 ----- require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic positions. Management uses in-house tax experts, professional advisers and previous experience when assessing tax risks. Depending on their nature, estimates of interest and penalties are included either in interest payable or in tax liabilities. As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments may arise which have a material impact on our tax rate and/or cash tax payments. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where we operate and generate taxable profits. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. _Deferred tax_ Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities where we control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities, where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

As part of the effort to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency, technological innovation in traditional internal combustion engines (“ICE”) has focused on introducing higher pressure fuel systems to help improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions, technology to help reduce evaporative emissions through more efficient fuel tanks and weight reduction techniques, including replacing steel fuel tanks with plastic fuel tanks. In addition to the focus on reduction of emissions from ICE, the industry is also rapidly shifting to alternative powertrain and propulsion technologies through electrification, such as HEV, BEV and AEV. IHS Markit projects CAGRs of 26% and 31% in global HEV and BEV production, respectively, between 2020 and 2027, and that HEVs and BEVs will constitute approximately 38% (compared to 10% in 2020) and 16% (compared to 3% in 2020), respectively, of global vehicle production volumes by 2027. HEVs combine traditional ICE fluid systems, but also have additional fluid handling systems to manage electrification-related component temperatures, including advanced thermal management systems for the chassis, power electronics, electric motor drive and battery systems. As a result, HEVs may have up to six thermal loops (as opposed to the two main thermal management loops in a traditional ICE thermal system). HEV thermal management systems typically include fluid lines and tubes, pumps, quick connectors, sensors and valves. In addition the fuel tank systems for HEVs must accommodate increased fuel vapor pressure, which builds up during the period when the internal combustion engine is not operating and is not available to purge the fuel vapor. BEVs and AEVs are expected to have significantly higher line and tubing content than traditional ICEs, depending on vehicle size, battery size and system design. As thermal components and systems in BEVs and AEVs may not be exposed to the same heat generated by ICEs, the systems in BEVs and AEVs may use different materials, such as nylon, to help optimize system weight, temperature and pressure.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Bundy supplied innovative fuel lines for the Ford Model T which were crafted out of a single strip of steel rolled around twice to create a double-walled tube. In 1929, Bundy’s engineers invented the “Bundyweld” tube, a double-walled steel tube that used brazed copper rather than solder to join the seams of the tubing. The result was enhanced torsion and bending qualities, increased resistance to corrosion and improved fatigue strength. At about the same time, hydraulic brakes were introduced by the automotive industry, creating a new application for Bundyweld tubing. Bundy’s brake and fuel tubing business grew with the automotive industry. In 1936, Bundy entered into its first international venture through a license agreement with Armco International Corporation to produce Bundyweld tubes in France and England. Over the course of the next 50 years Bundy continued to grow its business and expand its product line. In 1987, TI Group Plc (“TIGP”) acquired Armco International Corporation’s European tubing business and then acquired Bundy the following year.

We produce plastic fuel tanks using its patented “Ship-in-a-Bottle” and Tank Advanced Process Technology manufacturing methods to insert internal components (such as a pump module) into a multiple layer extruded plastic fuel tank while it is still in a molten state. Evaporative emissions from plastic fuel tanks can be reduced by using multiple barrier layers of specific resin materials to construct the tank and by minimizing the presence of openings and seals resulting from the insertion of components into the tank during the manufacturing process. The “Ship-in-a-Bottle” and Tank Advanced Process Technology manufacturing processes prevent evaporative emissions by eliminating the need to cut and reseal the plastic fuel tank. HEVs can use our Tank Advanced Process Technology which uses doublemolding to reinforce the plastic fuel tank so it can withstand higher vapor pressures in a hybrid fuel tank system, while the combustion engine idles during the vehicle electric mode. We also produces pressure resistant plastic fuel tanks with baffles, which help to reduce the noise generated during battery propulsion in HEVs and BEVs. We also manufacture plastic filler pipes, which have the benefit of being lighter than steel filler pipes and corrosion free. They also reduce hydrocarbon emissions through extrusion of multi-layered plastics in a process similar to the Group’s plastic fuel tank manufacturing process. In addition, the Group manufactures valves and venting for plastic fuel tank systems. _Fuel delivery products_ Our fuel delivery products, which comprise fuel pump modules for gasoline, diesel and flex-fuel vehicles, are inserted into the fuel tank during final tank assembly.

All of these EHS activities are designed to improve safety and reduce risk. The health and safety of our employees remains an overarching priority and is central to everything we do. We focus on safe working environments and eliminating work-related injuries and illnesses. As the COVID-19 pandemic began in China, we worked very closely with our Chinese EHS team to understand the situation and to implement controls and counter measures in our plants. This collaborative approach allowed us to quickly and efficiently develop a global procedure for reopening our plants following closure due to COVID-19. Our focus revolved around protecting our workforce to the best of our ability. To that end, we instituted two different procedures: one for plants and one for office settings. We established physical control measures, such as physical spacing, mask wearing, shield wearing and temperature checks, as well as administrative controls such as health assessments, contact tracing, and regular updates on the status of COVID-19 in the countries where we operate to assure safety. Prior to reopening, each location was virtually audited by a Corporate Regional EHS Manager. To assure ongoing compliance with the procedures, we instituted weekly audits for the plant management team. We continue to do additional corporate audits to verify compliance. This robust system of controls and checks has allowed us to open all of our plants and prevent the spread of COVID within our plants, thus protecting our most valuable asset – our people. At a local level, each plant is required to have a safety committee that is comprised of the plant manager, at least one other senior manager, as well as operators and supervisors working on the plant floor. The mandates of local safety committees vary depending on the plant but, generally, include hazard identification and assessments, accident investigations, safety audits, safety training, and recommending personnel protective equipment. 90 ----- In 2020, the we began a program to measure Lost Time Injury Frequency (“LTIF”) at each plant, by region and on a global consolidated basis. LTIF is calculated in accordance with guidance issued by the UK Health and Safety Executive. Our global LTIF for the period 2018 to 2020 is shown below. While our LTIF increased slightly over the 2018-2019 period, we believe that the increase was primarily due to more accurate and consistent reporting data. The 2020 LTIF saw a significant reduction. We believe this was driven by our strict COVID-19 protocols and regular EHS meetings with EHS plant teams. Our corporate EHS team is now meeting regularly with the MDs and their teams. We believe our LTIF compares very favorably to industrial benchmarks.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

These core values and the standards of business conduct that we follow in our daily work are detailed in our Code of Business Conduct and related policies (collectively, our “COBC”). Our COBC covers a wide range of polices and principles, including conflicts of interest, gifts and courtesies, anticorruption, anti-bribery, fair competition (anti-trust), positive work environment (anti-discrimination and anti-harassment), health and safety, and environmental compliance. Across all our activities, but particularly around safety, ethics and compliance, and diversity, we continue to develop and improve our policies and processes. Our COBC drives us to promote ethical practices and compliance, to protect the people we employ, to support the communities we work in and to respect and reduce our impact on the environment in which we operate. We remain committed to strengthening our ESG program in order to deliver a sustainable business for the benefit of all our stakeholders.

We seek to ensure that our people benefit from effective communications and engagement, with regular all employee meetings and divisional departmental meetings. We also encourage our management teams to hold regular informal update meetings to keep our employees informed and engaged. Our gender split in 2020 across salaried employees was 2.37:1.00 (male:female). Consistent with our core values and focus on our employees, we have continued to develop and improve our global safety programs. In particular, we developed and implemented procedures to protect our workforce and safely open and operate our facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace. To that end, we have formed a US-based Diversity and Inclusion Committee to be expanded globally in 2021 to provide perspective and ideas to help us develop practical and meaningful initiatives and programs. We operate in 28 countries worldwide. Our people and all of our operations are encouraged to develop a local strategy to make positive contributions to their communities. In 2020, our employees around the globe participated and contributed to many community and charitable projects and programs. These took place in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and North America. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, several of our plants, including Chalons, France, and Tauste and Montornes, Spain, used 3D printers and available resources to manufacture face shields for local hospitals, health centers and elderly residence facilities in their communities. This effort was very important in providing essential PPE that these facilities could not procure on their own. We donated thousands of face shields at a time when they were not available for purchase, helping to keep the people that live and work in our communities safe. _Ethics and Compliance_ Operating with integrity and in an ethical and compliant manner is one of our core values. Our principles of ethical standards are clearly set out in our COBC, which applies to all our employees globally. As a company, we expect all our suppliers to comply with the same standards of doing business as we set for ourselves and this requirement is set out in our Global Supplier Requirements Manual. Following the rollout of our new independent third-party operated Speak-Up hotline in 2019, we continued to manage risk and address concerns raised through the Speak-Up hotline. This hotline has provided our employees with a channel to raise questions and concerns anonymously. Additionally, we instituted a quarterly reporting meeting with members of the executive team to review the concerns raised by employees through the various Speak-Up channels and identify areas for improvement. The ethics and compliance function continues to work towards ensuring employees understand our COBC and are comfortable seeking guidance and reporting concerns. Recognizing the importance of maintaining and furthering a culture of ethics and integrity, through the leadership of the two divisional executive vice presidents and the Group Ethics and Compliance Director, we have created a working group comprised of senior members of management and the Group Ethics and Compliance Director who meet on a monthly basis to discuss ethics and compliance issues and address best practices to continually improve the culture of ethics and compliance at all levels of the organization.

In the past several years we have improved the manner and method in which we collect and verify energy, waste and water consumption data across all our global locations. While we continue to improve the scope and quality of our data, we have already seen sustainability benefits. Using our data, we have driven a net reduction of the production of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and have also increased the volume of material being recycled and reused at plants in all regions. We have a global energy monitoring program which we use to calculate our CO2(e) greenhouse gas emissions with a long-term goal of implementing efficiency programs to reduce energy consumption and our carbon footprint. Emissions for 2018 were calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as a reference and include all of our manufacturing facilities and corporate offices globally. Our greenhouse gas emissions have generally decreased from 2018 to 2020. In 2019, we made a considerable effort and investment in a more formal environmental data collection and reporting platform. We now use the same system that is used by the CDP (formerly, the Carbon Disclosure Project) to collect our data. This refined and improved data collection system will allow us to more accurately track not only our CO2 production but all production of greenhouse gases as defined by the Kyoto Protocol. As we look forward to 2021, we anticipate making our first public disclosure to the CDP for our 2020 calendar year data. With the establishment of the our ESG steering committee, we are expecting to update and enhance our environment policies and procedures. We expect to share more environmental-related data publicly through our website and via third party services like CDP and Ecovadis. We are planning on revising our CO2(e) targets as well as developing a water conservation target with board oversight in 2021. We have established a plan to develop a formal waste reduction target established by the end of 2022. Our Global and UK Scope 1 and 2 emissions are described in the graphs below. Scope 1 estimates include emissions from fossil fuel used on premises. Scope 2 estimates are emissions from purchased electricity. Emissions for 2020 have been calculated using UL Pure Credit 360 software and the calculations are completed to include all greenhouse gases as defined by the Kyoto Protocol. Calculations are transparently shown in the system and produce results in accordance with the methods in the GHG Protocol. We implemented this software between 2018 and 2019 and, as a result, Scope 1 emissions are now calculated using a more robust methodology, leading to a lower reported total for Scope 1 emissions (both Global and UK). The current software utilizes the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting for fuel conversions. The emissions reductions in 2020 are primarily a result of COVID-19 facility shutdowns and lower production volumes as well as, in the case of the UK, the procurement of renewable (wind) energy for our facility in Deeside, UK.

Each Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor will: - be a senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor; - rank equally in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future Indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, including such Guarantor’s guarantee of or Indebtedness under the Senior Facility Agreement; 102 ----- - rank senior in right of payment to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future Indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee; and - be effectively junior to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future secured Indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Facility Agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness. Not all of the Parent’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute or contribute any of their assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor. For the year ended December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, the Guarantors represented 32% of the Group’s consolidated EBITDA (without adjustment for intra-group transactions) and 35% of the Group’s consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, the Guarantors accounted for 33% of the Group’s total assets (property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, inventory and trade and other receivables excluding intra-group balances). The Issuer is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent and a direct subsidiary of TI Automotive, which holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the operating assets of the Group. The Issuer is a finance subsidiary that has not engaged in any operating activities since its incorporation and currently does not have any Subsidiaries. The Issuer will need to depend entirely on capital contributions from TI Automotive, repayment or servicing of loans made to the Parent or its other Subsidiaries or other funding to meet its obligations under the Notes. The operations of TI Automotive are conducted through its other Subsidiaries and, therefore, TI Automotive depends on the cash flow of Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including obligations under the Notes as a Guarantor. The Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Parent’s and TI Automotive’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of any Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of such Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinate in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by such Guarantor. The Parent’s nonGuarantor subsidiaries had €0.1 million of borrowings and €630 million of other liabilities (total liabilities less borrowings excluding intra-group balances), in each case, as of December 31, 2020, all of which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment (the “Change of Control Payment”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to the date of purchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Issuer will mail a notice to each Holder and the Trustee describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and offering to repurchase Notes on a date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in such notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act to the extent applicable and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of such Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer. The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes and the Trustee or the Registrar will, upon receipt of an Issuer order, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. In the case of certificated Notes, if the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest or Additional Amounts will be payable to Holders who tender pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; in the case of global Notes, the Issuer will pay accrued and unpaid interest to the Change of Control Payment Date to the Holder on such date. The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Repurchase Event will be applicable regardless of whether any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Repurchase Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the 109 ----- Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption for all of the outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture under the caption “—Optional Redemption” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the proposed redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, conditional upon the Change of Control, so long as a definitive agreement has been executed that contains terms and provisions that would otherwise result in a Change of Control upon completion of the transactions contemplated thereby. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Senior Facility Agreement and cause a default may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. In addition, future Indebtedness of the Parent and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event. The exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of other Indebtedness may prohibit the Issuer’s prepayment of Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. Consequently, if the Issuer is not able to prepay such Indebtedness or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer will be unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations if Holders of Notes exercise their repurchase rights following a Change of Control Repurchase Event, thereby resulting in a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture may result in a cross-default under such other Indebtedness. The Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving the Issuer by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The comments below assume that there will be no substitution of the Issuer or further issues of securities that will form a single series with the Notes and do not address the consequences of any such substitution or further issue (notwithstanding that such substitution or further issue may be permitted by the terms and conditions of the Notes). The comments below do not necessarily apply where the income is deemed for tax purposes to be the income of any other person. The references to “interest” below are to “interest” as understood for the purposes of UK tax law. They do not take into account any different definitions of “interest” that may prevail under any other tax law or that may apply under the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related document. The comments below relate only to persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes and any interest payable on their Notes and who hold Notes as a capital investment. Certain classes of persons (such as brokers, dealers in securities, market makers, depositaries, clearance services, certain professional investors, persons connected with the Issuer or persons who acquire (or are deemed to acquire) Notes by reason of an office or employment) may be subject to special rules and the comments below do not apply to such holders of Notes. The UK tax treatment of prospective holders of Notes depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. The comments below do not purport to constitute legal or tax advice and any prospective holders of Notes who are subject to tax in any jurisdiction other than the UK, or who are in any doubt as to their tax position, should consult an appropriate professional adviser.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The International Stock Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. The Notes will be treated for these purposes as listed on the International Stock Exchange if they are both admitted to trading on the International Stock Exchange and officially listed in Guernsey in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally applicable in countries in the European Economic Area. If the Notes are not or cease to be so listed, interest will generally be paid by the Issuer under deduction of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) unless (i) any other exemption or relief applies or (ii) the Issuer has received a direction to the contrary from HMRC in respect of such relief as may be available pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty. Any premium payable on redemption may be treated as a payment of interest for UK tax purposes and may accordingly be subject to the withholding tax treatment described above. In certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer will be obliged to gross-up payments on the Notes to ensure that the Noteholders receive and retain a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding for or on account of UK income tax been required. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”. _Payments by a Guarantor_ The UK withholding tax treatment of payments by a Guarantor in respect of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the Notes) is uncertain. If a 136 ----- Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes it is possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for any of the exemptions described above.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

However, where the interest is paid without withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income tax, the interest will not be assessed to UK tax in the hands of a holder of Notes (other than certain trustees) who is not resident for tax purposes in the UK, except where the holder of Notes carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency, or in the case of a corporate holder, carries on a trade through a permanent establishment in the UK, in connection with which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable, in which case (subject to exemptions for interest received by certain categories of agent) tax may be levied on the UK branch or agency, or permanent establishment. However exemption from, or reduction of, such UK tax liability might be available under an applicable double taxation treaty. Holders of the Notes should note that the provisions relating to additional amounts referred to in “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes” would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled to the relevant interest and premium to UK tax.

If Notes are not deeply discounted securities, they will fall outside the definition of “qualifying corporate bond” mentioned above. Accordingly, any disposal of such a Note by an individual holder who is resident for tax purposes in the UK or who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency to which such a Note is attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for the purposes of UK tax on chargeable gains, depending on individual circumstances. In calculating any gain or 137 ----- allowable loss on disposal of such a Note, sterling values are compared at acquisition and transfer or redemption. Accordingly, a UK taxable gain could arise even where any Euro amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the amount paid for a Note. _Accrued Income Profits_ On a disposal of Notes by a holder of Notes, any interest which has accrued since the last interest payment date may be chargeable to tax as income under the rules relating to accrued income profits as set out in Part 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 if that holder of Notes is resident in the UK or carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable. These provisions will not apply if the Notes are deemed to be “deeply discounted securities” (as to which, please see “Taxation of Discount” below). _Taxation of Discount_ Dependent, among other things, on the discount (if any) at which the Notes are issued, or, in certain cases, the premium (if any) payable on redemption, the Notes may be deemed to constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4 of the ITTOIA 2005. If Notes are deemed to constitute deeply discounted securities, individual holders of the Notes who are resident for tax purposes in the UK or who carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable generally will be liable to UK income tax on any profit made on the sale or other disposal (including redemption) of the Notes, however such holders will not be able to claim relief from UK income tax in respect of costs incurred on the acquisition, transfer or redemption of, or losses incurred on the transfer or redemption of, the Notes.

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.48,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.48.1,Characterization of the Notes,"We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or make additional payments in 139 ----- redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest (as described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control Triggering Event” and “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Note, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. Holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.48,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.48.2,Payments of Stated Interest,"Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below with respect to the Notes, payments of stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Payments of interest on the Notes will be denominated in euro. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder that receives an interest payment in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the “spot rate” in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in foreign currency in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of interest income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale or other disposition of a Note) denominated in foreign currency, an accrual basis U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) in respect of an accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the amount previously accrued during such accrual period (as described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source gain or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.48,Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations,21.48.3,Original Issue Discount,"The Notes may be treated as having been issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the issue price of the Notes is less than their stated principal amount by an amount greater than or 140 ----- equal to a statutorily defined de minimis amount (1/4 of 1 percent of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date). If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on a Note, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis, before the Holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. The amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” (other than the initial short accrual period and the final accrual period) a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The OID allocable to any accrual period will equal (a) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period) less (b) the stated interest on the Notes allocable to the accrual period. The “yield to maturity” is the discount rate that, when applied to all payments under a Note as of its issue date, results in a present value equal to the Note’s issue price. The amount of OID allocable to any initial short accrual period generally may be computed under any reasonable method. The amount of OID allocable to the final accrual period is the difference between the stated principal amount of the Note and the adjusted issue price of the Note at the beginning of the final accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note as of the beginning of any accrual period generally will equal its issue price, increased by previously accrued OID. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder of a Note generally will be required to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. A U.S. Holder may irrevocably elect, subject to certain limitations, to treat all interest on any Note as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the method described above. The election must be made for the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder acquires the Note and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about this election. A U.S. Holder of Notes must (i) determine OID allocable to each accrual period in euro using the constant yield method described above and (ii) translate the amount into U.S. dollars in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting as described above under “—Payments of Interest”. A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when an amount attributable to accrued OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The adjusted tax basis of a Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase increased by any previously accrued OID. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the cash plus the fair market value of all other property received on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such sale or other taxable disposition, the amount realized will generally be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. 141 ----- Gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount”. However, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize any exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition. Gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the Notes for more than one year. For non corporate U.S. Holders, long term capital gains are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its particular circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The amount of gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of such foreign currency for U.S. dollars will be equal to the difference between (1) the amount of U.S. dollars received and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency. Upon any subsequent exchange of such foreign currency for property, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between (1) the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency paid for such property based on the spot rate of exchange for such foreign currency on the date of the exchange and (2) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the foreign currency so exchanged. As discussed above, if the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition. A U.S. Holder that purchases a Note with previously owned foreign currency will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency and the U.S. dollar fair market value of such note on the date of purchase.

However, under proposed Treasury Regulations issued in December 2018 (and upon which taxpayers may rely until final Treasury Regulations are issued), such withholding does not apply to any “foreign passthru payment” that is made before the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” from FATCA unless “materially modified” (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) after such date. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after expiration of the grandfather period. Non U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.

The discussion is limited to considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except to the extent discussed in “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and does not address the effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could significantly affect the U.S. federal tax consequences described below and adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash). This discussion is general in nature and does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax under Section 59A of the Code. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation: - holders of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities; 138 ----- - U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long term residents of the United States; - persons liable for the alternative minimum tax; - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement (as defined in Section 451 of the Code); - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; - individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts; - real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies; - brokers, dealers and traders in securities; - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; - persons who actually or constructively own more than 10% of our stock (by vote or value); - S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities (and investors therein); - tax exempt organizations and governmental organizations; and - persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or - a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the Notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them. THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING THE MEDICARE CONTRIBUTION TAX ON NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY. This summary assumes that the Notes will be treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.49,Certain Polish Tax Considerations,21.49.1,,"The following is a discussion of certain Polish tax considerations relevant to an investor resident in Poland or which is otherwise subject to Polish taxation. This statement should not be deemed to be tax advice. It is based on Polish tax laws and, as its interpretation refers to the position as at the date of this offering memorandum, it may thus be subject to change including a change with retroactive effect. Any change may negatively affect tax treatment, as described below. This description does not purport to be complete with respect to all tax information that may be relevant to investors due to their personal circumstances. Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their professional tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, disposal, redemption or transfer without consideration of the Notes. The information provided below does not cover tax consequences concerning income tax exemptions applicable to specific taxable items or specific taxpayers (e.g. domestic or foreign investment funds). 143 ----- The reference to “interest” as well as to any other terms in the paragraphs below means “interest” or any other term as understood in Polish tax law. (a) Taxation of a Polish tax resident private investor (natural person) Under Art. 3.1 of the Personal Income Tax Act dated 26 July (the “PIT Act”), natural persons, if residing in the Republic of Poland, are liable for tax on their total income (revenue) irrespective of the location of the sources of revenue (unlimited obligation to pay tax). Under Art. 3.1a of the PIT Act, a Polish tax resident individual is a natural person who (i) has his/her centre of personal or business interests located in Poland or (ii) stays in Poland for longer than 183 days in a year, unless any relevant tax treaty dictates otherwise. (1) Income from capital investments other than interest Income other than interest derived by a Polish tax resident individual from debt financial instruments held as non-business assets, including income from a transfer of Notes for consideration, qualify as capital income according to Art. 17 of PIT Act. This income does not cumulate with the general income subject to the progressive tax scale but is subject to a 19 per cent. flat rate tax. The costs of acquiring the Notes are recognised at the time the revenue is achieved. Based on Art. 17.2 and Art. 19.1 of the PIT Act, if the price expressed in the contract without a valid reason significantly deviates from the market value, the amount of income is determined by the tax authority or fiscal control authority in the amount of the market value. In principle, this income should be settled by the taxpayer by 30 April of the year following the year in which the income was earned. No tax or tax advances should be withheld by the person making the payments. (2) Withholding tax on interest income Under Art. 30a.7 of the PIT Act, interest income (discount) does not cumulate with general income subject to the progressive tax rate but under Art. 30a.1.2 of the PIT Act it is subject to 19 per cent. flat rate tax. Under Article 41.4 of the PIT Act, the interest payer, other than an individual not acting within the scope of his/her business activity, should withhold the 19 per cent. Polish tax upon any interest payment. Under the Art. 41.4d of the PIT Act, tax on interest or discount on Notes is withheld by entities keeping Notes accounts for taxpayers, in their capacity as tax remitters, if the income (revenue) is earned in the territory of Poland and is associated with the Notes registered in these accounts, and, further, if relevant payments are made to the taxpayers through those entities. This principle also applies to remitters who are payers of corporate income tax and are subject to limited tax liability in Poland, to the extent they conduct their business through a foreign establishment and it is to that establishment’s operations that the Notes account is linked. There are no regulations defining in which cases income earned (revenue) by a Polish tax resident should be considered income (revenue) earned in Poland. However, it is expected those cases will be analogous to those of non-residents. Pursuant to Art. 3.2b of the PIT Act, income (revenues) earned in the Republic of Poland by non-residents shall include in particular income (revenues) from: 1. work performed in the Republic of Poland based on a service relationship, employment relationship, outwork system and co-operative employment relationship irrespective of the place where remuneration is paid; 2. activity performed in person in the Republic of Poland irrespective of the place where remuneration is paid; 3. economic activity pursued in the Republic of Poland, including through a foreign establishment located in the Republic of Poland; 4. immovable property located in the Republic of Poland or rights to such property, including from its disposal in whole or in part, or from disposal of any rights to such property; 5. Notes and derivatives other than Notes, admitted to public trading in the Republic of Poland as part of the regulated stock exchange market, including those obtained from the disposal of these Notes or derivatives, or the exercise of rights resulting from them; 144 ----- 6. the transfer of ownership of shares in a company, of all rights and obligations in a partnership without legal personality, or participation in an investment fund, a collective investment undertaking or other legal entity and rights of similar character or from receivables being a consequence of holding those shares, rights and obligations, participation or rights, if at least 50 per cent. of the value of assets of such company, partnership, investment fund, collective investment undertaking or legal entity is constituted, directly or indirectly, by immovable properties located in the Republic of Poland, or rights to such immovable properties; 7. the transfer of ownership of shares, all rights and obligations, participation or similar rights in a real estate company (as defined in the PIT Act); 8. the receivables settled, including receivables put at disposal, paid out or deducted, by natural persons, legal persons, or organisational units without legal personality, having their place of residence, registered office, or management board in the Republic of Poland, irrespective of the place of concluding and performing the agreement; and/or 9. unrealised gains as referred to in the exit tax regulations. The above list is not exhaustive; therefore, the tax authorities may also consider that income (revenues) not listed above is sourced in Poland. Given the above, each situation should be analysed to determine whether interest earned by a Polish tax resident individual from the Notes is considered to be income sourced in Poland and whether the entity operating the Notes account for the individual will withhold the tax. Since the Issuer is not a Polish entity, as a rule interest from the Notes should not be considered as earned in the territory of Poland, unless there is a specific nexus (e.g. the Notes are admitted to public trading in Poland). Although this is not clearly regulated in Polish tax law, in fact, foreign entities do not act as Polish withholding tax remitters (save when such foreign entities operate by way of a branch that constitutes a tax establishment in Poland). Therefore, it should be expected that the issuer itself or a non-Polish entity operating the Notes account for the individual will not withhold the tax. According to Article 45.3b of the PIT Act, if the tax is not withheld, the individual is obliged to settle the tax himself/herself by 30 April of the following year. Separate rules apply to interest income on Notes held in Polish omnibus accounts (within the meaning of the provisions of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments, hereinafter “Omnibus Accounts”). Under Art. 41.10 of the PIT Act, insofar as Notes registered in Omnibus Accounts are concerned, the entities operating Omnibus Accounts through which the amounts due are paid are liable to withhold the flat-rate income tax on interest income. The tax is charged on the day of placing the amounts due at the disposal of the Omnibus Account holder. Pursuant to Art. 30a.2a of the PIT Act, with respect to income (revenue) from interest transferred to taxpayers holding rights attached to Notes registered in Omnibus Accounts whose identity has not been revealed to the tax remitter in accordance with the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments, a 19% flatrate tax is withheld by the tax remitter (under Art. 41.10 of the PIT Act the entity operating the Omnibus Account) from the aggregate income (revenue) released for the benefit of all such taxpayers through the Omnibus Account holder. Under Art. 45.3c of the PIT Act, taxpayers are obliged to disclose the amount of interest (discount) on Notes in their annual tax return if the Notes were registered in an Omnibus Account and the taxpayer’s identity was not disclosed to the tax remitter. Under Art. 30a.9 of the PIT Act, withholding tax incurred outside Poland (including countries which have not concluded a tax treaty with Poland), up to an amount equal to the tax paid abroad, but not higher than 19 per cent. tax on the interest amount, could be deducted from the Polish tax liability. Double tax treaties can provide other methods of withholding tax settlements. (3) Notes held as business assets If an individual holds the Notes as business assets, in principle, interest (discount) and income from a transfer of Notes for consideration should be subject to tax in the same way as other business income. The tax, at 19 per cent. flat rate or the 17 per cent. to 32 per cent. progressive tax rate depending on the choice and meeting of certain conditions, should be settled by the individuals themselves. 145 ----- (b) Taxation of a Polish tax resident corporate income taxpayer Under Art. 3.1 of the Corporate Income Tax Act dated 15 February 1992 (the “CIT Act”) the entire income of taxpayers who have their registered office or place of management in Poland is subject to tax obligation in Poland, irrespective of where the income is earned. The appropriate tax rate is the same as the tax rate applicable to business activity, i.e. 19 per cent. for a corporate income taxpayer or 9 per cent. for small and new taxpayers. A Polish tax resident corporate income taxpayer is subject to income tax in respect of the Notes (both on any capital gains and on interest/discount) following the same principles as those which apply to any other income received from business activity within the same source of income. As a rule, for Polish income tax purposes interest is recognised as revenue on a cash basis, i.e. when it is received and not when it has accrued. In respect of capital gains, the cost of acquiring the Notes will be recognised at the time the revenue is achieved. Revenue from a transfer of Notes for consideration is, in principle, their value expressed as the price specified in the contract. If the price expressed in the contract, without a valid reason, significantly deviates from the market value, the revenue amount is determined by the tax authority as an amount equivalent to the market value (Art. 14 of the CIT Act). In the case of income from the transfer of Notes for consideration, tax deductible costs are generally recognised when the corresponding revenue has been received. The taxpayer (without the remitter’s participation) settles income tax on interest/discount and on the transfer of Notes for consideration, which is settled along with other income from the taxpayer’s business activity within the same source of income. Regarding the proper source of revenue, in principle, the income (revenue) from the Notes, including their transfer against a consideration, is combined with revenues from capital gains (Art. 7b.1 of the CIT Act). In the case of insurers, banks and some other entities (financial institutions), this revenue is included in revenues other than revenues from capital gains (Art. 7b(2) of the CIT Act). Although no Polish withholding tax should apply on interest payable to Polish corporate income taxpayers, under specific rules applying to interest income on Notes held in Omnibus Accounts, under Art. 26.2a of the CIT Act, for income (revenue) from interest transferred to taxpayers holding rights attached to Notes registered in Omnibus Accounts whose identity has not been revealed to the tax remitter in accordance with the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments, a 20 per cent. flat-rate tax is withheld by the tax remitter from the aggregate income (revenue) released for the benefit of all such taxpayers through the Omnibus Account holder. If such tax is withheld for a Polish tax resident corporate income taxpayer, to receive a refund of such tax, the entity should contact its tax advisor. Any withholding tax incurred outside Poland (including countries which have not concluded any tax treaty with Poland), up to an amount equal to the tax paid abroad, but not higher than the tax calculated in accordance with the applicable domestic tax rate, can be deducted from the Polish tax liability. Double tax treaties can provide other methods of withholding tax settlements. (c) Notes held by a non-Polish tax resident (natural person or corporate income taxpayer) Under Art. 3.2a of the PIT Act, natural persons, if they do not reside in Poland, are liable to pay tax only on income (revenue) earned in Poland (limited obligation to pay tax). Under Art. 3.2 of the CIT Act, in the case of taxpayers who do not have their registered office or management in Poland, only the income they earn in Poland is subject to taxation in Poland. Non-Polish tax residents who are natural persons or corporate income tax payers are subject to Polish income tax only with respect to their income earned in Poland. Under Art. 3.3 of the CIT Act, income (revenues) earned in the Republic of Poland by non-residents shall include in particular income (revenues) from: 1. all types of activity pursued in the Republic of Poland, including through a foreign establishment located in the Republic of Poland; 2. immovable property located in the Republic of Poland or rights to such property, including from its disposal in whole or in part, or from the disposal of any rights to such property; 3. Notes and derivatives other than Notes, admitted to public trading in the Republic of Poland as part of the regulated stock exchange market, including those obtained from the disposal of these Notes or derivatives, or the exercise of rights resulting from them; 4. the transfer of ownership of shares in a company, of all rights and obligations in a partnership without legal personality, or participation in an investment fund, a collective investment undertaking or other 146 ----- legal entity and rights of similar character or from receivables being a consequence of holding those shares, rights and obligations, participation or rights, if at least 50 per cent. of the value of assets of such company, partnership, investment fund, collective investment undertaking or legal entity is constituted, directly or indirectly, by immovable properties located in the Republic of Poland, or rights to such immovable properties; 5. the transfer of ownership of shares, all rights and obligations, participation or similar rights in a real estate company (as defined in the CIT Act); 6. the receivables settled, including receivables put at disposal, paid out or deducted, by natural persons, legal persons, or organisational units without legal personality, having their place of residence, registered office, or management board in the Republic of Poland, irrespective of the place of concluding or performing the agreement; and/or 7. unrealised gains referred to in the exit tax regulations. Similar provisions are included in Art. 3.2b of the PIT Act. It should be noted that the list of income (revenues) earned in Poland, as provided in Art. 3.3. of the CIT Act and Art. 3.2b of the PIT Act is not exhaustive, therefore, other income (revenues) may also be deemed to be earned in the Republic of Poland. Even though the above list of circumstances in which income (revenue) is sourced in the Republic of Poland is not exhaustive, it could be argued that, in principle, payments under Notes issued by a foreign entity are not sourced in Poland unless one of the cases indicated above occurs (in particular, the Notes are traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange). If income from the Notes is considered as sourced in Poland, the following applies: _Special exemption for Notes meeting special conditions_ Under Art. 17.1.50c of the CIT Act, tax-free income is income earned by a CIT taxpayer subject to limited tax liability in Poland in respect of interest or a discount on Notes: (a) having a maturity of at least one year; (b) admitted to trading on a regulated market or introduced into an alternative trading system within the meaning of the Act of 29 July 2005 on Trading in Financial Instruments, in the territory of Poland or in the territory of a state that is a party to a double tax convention concluded with Poland which regulates the taxation of income from dividends, interest and royalties; unless the taxpayer is an affiliate (within the meaning of the transfer pricing law) of the issuer of such Notes, and holds, directly or indirectly, together with other affiliates (within the meaning of those regulations), more than 10 per cent. of the notional value of those Notes. Under Art. 26.1aa-1ac of the CIT Act, remitters are not obliged to withhold tax on interest or discount in respect of Notes meeting the above requirements, provided that the issuer submits to the tax authority a declaration that it has acted with due diligence in informing affiliates, within the meaning of the transfer pricing provisions, about the exemption conditions applying to those affiliates. The declaration is made once in relation to a given issue of Notes, not later than the date of the payment of interest or discount on the Notes. Analogous provisions apply to personal income tax (Art. 21.1.130c and Art. 41.24-26 of the PIT Act). _Failure to meet the conditions for a special exemption_ In the absence of the exemption referred to above, the following rules apply: In the case of taxpayers subject to limited tax liability in Poland, the interest (discount) on Notes earned in the Polish territory is taxed, as a general rule, at a flat rate of 20 per cent. in the case of corporate income tax payers (Art. 21.1.1 of the CIT Act) or 19 per cent. in the case of natural persons (Art. 30a.1.2 of the PIT Act). Under Art. 26.1 of the CIT Act, interest payers, other than individuals not acting within the scope of their business activity, should withhold this tax and similar provisions are provided in Art. 41.4 of the PIT Act. Under Art. 26.2c.1 of the CIT Act, the entities operating Notes accounts and Omnibus Accounts for taxpayers, acting as tax remitters, should withhold this interest income if such interest income (revenue) was 147 ----- earned in Poland, is connected with Notes registered in said accounts and the interest payment to the taxpayer is made through said entities. Although it is considered that foreign entities do not act as Polish tax remitters, according to the abovementioned provision, this obligation applies to non-residents to the extent they operate a permanent establishment in Poland and the account, on which Notes are registered, is linked to the activity of this permanent establishment. Similar provisions concerning interest payments to individuals are provided in Art. 41.4d of the PIT Act. The rules of taxation described here may be modified by the relevant provisions of double tax treaties concluded by Poland, based on which a reduced tax rate or income tax exemption may apply to income (revenue) obtained from interest/discount (Art. 21.2 of the CIT Act, Art. 30a.2 of the PIT Act). To benefit from the tax rate or income tax exemption under the tax treaty, the taxpayer should present a valid certificate of its tax residence. As a rule, the tax residence certificate is considered valid for twelve consecutive months from its date of issue. Moreover, many tax treaties provide protection only for beneficial owners. Pursuant to Art. 4a.29 of the CIT Act and, respectively, Art. 5a.33d of the PIT Act, beneficial owner means an entity meeting all of the following conditions: (a) it receives the amount due for its own benefit, which includes deciding independently about its purpose, and bears the economic risk associated with the loss of that receivable or part of it; (b) it is not an intermediary, representative, trustee or another entity legally or actually obliged to transfer the receivable in whole or in part to another entity; and (c) it conducts real business activity in the country of its registration, if the receivables are obtained in connection with the conducted business activity. The majority of double tax treaties concluded by Poland provide for an exemption from income tax on capital gains, including income from the sale of Notes obtained in Poland by a tax resident of a given country. Separate, specific rules apply to interest income on Notes held in Omnibus Accounts. Also, in cases where Polish withholding tax should not apply on interest payable to non-Polish tax residents (natural persons or corporate income taxpayers), under specific rules applicable to interest income on Notes held in Omnibus Accounts there is a risk that such tax would be withheld. Under Art. 26.2a of the CIT Act, with respect to income (revenue) from interest transferred to taxpayers holding rights attached to Notes registered in Omnibus Accounts whose identity has not been revealed to the tax remitter in accordance with the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments, a 20 per cent. flat-rate tax is withheld by the tax remitter from the aggregate income (revenue) released for the benefit of all such taxpayers through the Omnibus Account holder. Under Art. 30a.2a of the PIT Act, with respect to income (revenue) from interest transferred to taxpayers holding rights attached to Notes registered in Omnibus Accounts whose identity has not been revealed to the tax remitter in accordance with the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments, a 19 per cent. flat-rate tax is withheld by the tax remitter from the aggregate income (revenue) released for the benefit of all such taxpayers through the Omnibus Account holder. If such tax is withheld for non-Polish tax resident taxpayers, to receive a refund of such tax, the entity should contact its tax advisor. If a foreign recipient of income acts through a permanent establishment in Poland to which interest is related, as a matter of principle it should be treated in the same manner as a Polish tax resident, with some necessary additional requirements (e.g. the requirement to present the interest payer with a certificate of tax residence along with a declaration that the interest is related to the establishment’s activities). (d) Special provisions on withholding tax on large payments _Corporate income tax_ Under Art. 26.2e of the CIT Act, if the total amount paid out on account of the items listed in Art. 21.1 of the CIT Act (including interest/discount on Notes) and Art. 22.1 of the CIT Act to the same taxpayer exceeds PLN 2,000,000 in the tax year of the payer, payers are, as a general rule, required to withhold, on the day of payment, a flat-rate income tax at the basic rate (20 per cent. in the case of interest/discount on Notes) from the excess over that amount, without taking into account any possibility of avoiding withholding that tax on the basis of an appropriate double tax treaty, and also without taking into account exemptions or rates resulting from special regulations or double tax treaties (hereinafter the “Obligation to Withhold Tax”). Under Art. 26.2i and 26.2j of the CIT Act, if the payer’s tax year is longer or shorter than 12 months, the amount to which the Obligation to Withhold Tax applies is calculated by multiplying 1/12 of PLN 148 ----- 2,000,000 and the number of months that have begun in the tax year in which the payment was made. If the calculation of that amount is not possible by reference to the payer’s tax year, the Obligation to Withhold Tax shall apply accordingly to the payer’s current financial year and, in its absence, with respect to the payer’s other period with features specific to the financial year, for a period not longer than 23 consecutive months. Under Art. 26.2k of the CIT Act, if the payment was made in a foreign currency, to determine whether the amount to which the Obligation to Withhold Tax applies was exceeded, the amounts paid are converted into PLN at the average exchange rate published by the National Bank of Poland on the last business day preceding the payment day. Under Art. 26.2l of the CIT Act, if it is not possible to determine the amount paid to the same taxpayer, it is presumed that it exceeded the amount from which the Obligation to Withhold Tax applies. Under Art. 26.7a of the CIT Act, the Obligation to Withhold Tax does not apply if the payer has declared that: (a) it holds the documents required by tax law for the application of the tax rate or tax exemption or non-taxation under special regulations or double tax treaties; (b) after verifying that of the conditions to apply an exemption or reduced withholding tax rate resulting from special regulations or double tax treaties are satisfied, it is not aware of any grounds for the assumption that there are circumstances that exclude the possibility of applying the tax rate or tax exemption or non-taxation under special regulations or double tax treaties, in particular it is not aware of the existence of circumstances preventing the fulfilment of certain conditions referred to in other regulations, including the fact that the interest/discount recipient is their beneficial owner and, if the interest/discount is obtained in connection with the business activity conducted by the taxpayer, that in the country of tax residence the taxpayer carries on the actual business activity. The above is to be declared by the head of the unit within the meaning of the Accounting Act (e.g. the Issuer’s management board), specifying his/her position. The declaration cannot be made by proxy. The declaration is to be made in electronic form not later than the payment day (Art. 26.7b and 26.7c of the CIT Act). In the case of withholding tax as a result of the Obligation to Withhold Tax, if double tax treaties or special regulations provide for a tax exemption or reduced tax rate, the taxpayer or tax remitter (if the taxpayer has paid tax with its own funds and has borne the economic burden of such tax, e.g. as a result of a gross-up clause) may apply for a refund of that tax by submitting the relevant documents and declarations. When recognising that the refund is justified, the tax authorities shall carry it out within six months. Pursuant to the Regulation of the Minister of Finance dated 31 December 2018 regarding the exclusion or limited application of Art. 26.2e of the CIT Act (the “Regulation”), the application of the Obligation to Withhold Tax is excluded inter alia in relation to the following interest/discount payments: (a) to central banks not having their registered office or management in the territory of the Republic of Poland, obtained from interest or discount on treasury bonds issued by the State Treasury on the domestic market and acquired from 7 November 2015; (b) to economic units established by a state administration body jointly with other States under an agreement or contract, unless those agreements or contracts provide otherwise; (c) to international organisations of which the Republic of Poland is a member; (d) to entities with which the Republic of Poland has concluded cooperation agreements, if they have been exempted from corporate income tax on the receivables in question; and (e) to entities exempt from corporate income tax, provided that their name is indicated in double tax treaties to which the Republic of Poland is a party. In addition, until 30 June 2021, the Obligation to Withhold Tax is excluded in respect of interest/discount on Notes for taxpayers having their registered office or management in the territory of a state being a party to a double tax treaty with the Republic of Poland which regulates the taxation of income from dividends, interest and royalties, if there is a legal basis for exchanging tax information with the state of the taxpayer’s registered office or management. It should be noted that payments made in 2021, but before 30 June 2021, that are excluded from the Obligation to Withhold Tax under the Regulation, will be included in the above-mentioned limit from which the Obligation to Withhold Tax applies, in relation to payments made after 30 June 2021. 149 ----- The Obligation to Withhold Tax does not apply in the case of the special exemption applicable to Notes meeting certain conditions referred to in the section “Special exemption for Notes meeting special _conditions” above, provided that the Issuer submits to the tax authority a declaration that the Issuer has_ observed due diligence in informing its affiliates, within the meaning of the provisions on transfer pricing, about the terms of that exemption in relation to those affiliates. The declaration is made once in relation to a given issue of Notes, by no later than the date of the payment of interest or discount on the Notes. Personal income tax Analogous provisions apply to personal income tax, including Art. 41.12 of the PIT Act which provides for an analogous tax withholding obligation. The Regulation of the Minister of Finance of 31 December 2018 regarding the exclusion or limited application of Art. 41.12 of the PIT Act is the equivalent of the Regulation described under “Corporate income tax” above. (e) Tax on civil law transactions Neither an issuance of the Notes, nor a redemption of the Notes is subject to tax on civil law transactions. In light of Art. 1.1.1.a of the Tax on Civil Law Transactions Act dated 9 September 2000 (the “PCC Act”), agreements for sale or exchange of assets or proprietary rights are subject to tax on civil law transactions. The Notes should be considered as representing proprietary rights. Transactions are taxable if their subjects are: (a) assets located in Poland or proprietary rights exercisable in Poland; (b) assets located abroad or proprietary rights exercisable abroad if the acquirer’s place of residence or registered office is located in Poland and the civil law transaction was carried out in Poland. Although this is not clearly addressed in the law, in principle, the Notes should not be considered as rights exercisable in Poland, consequently, the tax would apply only if the purchaser was Polish and the transaction was concluded in Poland. If the sale or exchange of the Notes is subject to the PCC Act, then the tax at 1% of the market value of the Notes should be payable within 14 days after the sale or exchange agreement has been entered into. However, if such agreement has been entered into in notarial form, the tax due should be withheld and paid by the notary public. Tax on sale of the Notes is payable by the entity acquiring the Notes. In the case of exchange agreements, tax on civil law transactions should be payable by both parties jointly and severally. However, under Art. 9.9 of the PCC Act, an exemption applies to the sale of property rights constituting financial instruments (such as the Notes): (a) to investment companies and foreign investment companies; (b) via investment companies or foreign investment companies; (c) as part of organised trading; or (d) outside organised trading by investment companies and foreign investment companies, if those rights were acquired by those companies under organised trading, within the meaning of the provisions of the Act of 29 July 2005 on Trading in Financial Instruments. Moreover, in accordance with Art. 1a.5 and 1a.7 in connection with Art. 2.4 of the PCC Act, the PCC exemption applies to sale or exchange agreements concerning the Notes: (a) to the extent that they are taxed with the VAT in Poland or in another EU Member State or EEA; or (b) when at least one of the parties to the transaction is exempt from VAT in Poland or in another EU Member State or EEA on account of that particular transaction. (f) Remitter’s liability Under Art. 30 of the Tax Code dated 29 August 1997, a tax remitter failing to fulfil its duty to calculate, withhold or pay tax to a relevant tax authority is liable for the tax that has not been withheld or that has been withheld but not paid, up to the value of all its assets.

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,266,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES,266.1,European Union,266.1.1,,"Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in Germany, Belgium and Poland, which are Member States of the European Union. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), and starting from June 26, 2017, which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company organized under the laws of a Member State is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The “centre of main interests” is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the “centre of main interests” of a company in that respect, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office, and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established. If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in a Member State in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are automatically recognized in the Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a company carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State 151 ----- where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the company’s “centre of main interests” is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial (secondary) proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. He may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other Member State. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its 152 ----- creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the group’s members. The EU Insolvency Regulations provides - for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) courts and (iii) courts and insolvency practitioners; - for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; - that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and - that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. _EU directive on preventative restructuring frameworks_ The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019. The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. 153 ----- The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive. In the event that the Issuer or a Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

This also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose centre of main interests is not situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction. Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/ _faillite)._ Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX “Insolvency of enterprises” of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (the “Belgian Insolvency Act”). Note that in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation déficitaire). The latter proceedings will not be further discussed.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,266,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES,266.2,Belgium,266.2.2,Judicial Reorganization,"A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed. As from the filing of the petition with the competent court and as long as such court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelve months as from the start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months. 154 ----- The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued. If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantors, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur _d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of_ any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice). Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the debtors or one of its corporate bodies, the court may replace them with a temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/ _administrateur provisoire) for the duration of the moratorium._ The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations. The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties. 155 ----- In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it. In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, although only limited measures can be imposed by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without their individual consent. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy. To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. The court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The court-ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de _justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be limited to the transfer_ price, subject to some limited exceptions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,266,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES,266.2,Belgium,266.2.3,Bankruptcy,"Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation (Recast). Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de _paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they_ fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver 156 ----- (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one or several ongoing contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will not impair any rights _in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an ongoing contract may demand_ the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, in which case its claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors. The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contract. As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse). For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period. If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the Insolvency Regulation (Recast), not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles: - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called “estate debts,” have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. 157 ----- - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization). - Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests. - Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated). - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met. Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods” (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit requirement is not met and the creditor knew or should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture will contains such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor(s) will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit. The grant of a guarantee by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate purpose and statutory purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association, and the guarantee may not include any liability that would result in unlawful financial assistance in accordance with Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations dated 23 March 2019, as amended from time to time, whichever is applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte _periode/période suspecte)._ The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) security interests provided for pre-existing debts (save for any security granted during the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings). Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment. In particular, a guarantee entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or at an undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee were aware of the Belgian Guarantor’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure pre-existing debts. If the Notes Guarantee granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the above), holders of the Additional Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests. Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio _pauliana)._ Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed and the date of registration.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (for further detail on what constitutes a qualifying floating charge, see “ —Administrative Receivership” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered successively to determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing the company as a going-concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a 160 ----- whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “ —Onset of Insolvency” below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if the English Guarantor were to enter into administration, the notes and the guarantee, as applicable, may not be enforceable while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure you that the Trustee would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). If an English company were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent such security is a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it would be enforceable while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the administrators.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

That party will also be able to appoint an administrative receiver if the qualifying floating charge falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers, or if the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and generally includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security 161 ----- pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement”, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration” above). The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although the receiver owes the chargor a duty to act in good faith during the course of his/her appointment). This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Fixed versus floating charges” below).",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the_ court and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). A creditor’s voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because it means secured creditors can go ahead and enforce their security. 162 ----- A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Avoidance of _Transactions” below)._",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50 per cent. (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, except to the extent that it is under-secured.

In practice, the requisite “sufficient connection” has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s “center of main interests” is in England and Wales, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not specific circumstances satisfy the requirement for sufficient connection in any given case. Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75 per cent. or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing at which the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or decline to sanction the scheme.

The CIGA is intended to improve the ability of companies to be efficiently restructured and it includes the following provisions. 163 ----- _Moratorium_ The CIGA inserts a new stand-alone moratorium into the Insolvency Act 1986 to facilitate company restructurings. Entry into a moratorium is similar to the current out-of-court administrator appointment procedure, i.e., filing relevant papers at court (except where the company is subject to an outstanding winding-up petition (unless the moratorium is commenced before 30 September 2021) or is an overseas company, in which case the company must apply to court for the moratorium). The moratorium is subject to the supervision of a licensed insolvency practitioner (the “Monitor”). As a condition to commencement of the moratorium, the company requires confirmation from the Monitor that the company is eligible for the moratorium and that, in the Monitor’s view, it is likely that a moratorium for the company would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern (or, where the moratorium is commenced before 30 September 2021, that it is likely that a moratorium for the company would result in the rescue of the company as a going concern or would do so if it were not for any worsening of the financial position of the company for reasons relating to coronavirus). The moratorium is available to companies that are, or are likely to become, unable to pay their debts. A company is excluded from being eligible for the moratorium if (among other matters): - at any time in the previous 12 months, the company has been subject to a formal insolvency proceeding; or - the company is party to a “capital market arrangement” (including the grant of security or a guarantee) under which a party has incurred a debt of at least £10 million, where the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. The moratorium lasts for an initial period of 20 business days, subject to possible extension. A company subject to a moratorium effectively receives a payment holiday in respect of its pre-moratorium debts, subject to broad exceptions (including debts or liabilities arising under a contract involving financial services). The Monitor must terminate the moratorium if certain circumstances arise, including if the Monitor thinks that the moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of a company as a going concern (and, until 30 September 2021, that, even if one were to disregard any worsening of the financial position of the company for reasons relating to coronavirus, the moratorium would not be likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern). If a company enters liquidation within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, any unpaid moratorium debts, and certain pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium, will have priority over other claims in the liquidation. Pre-existing financial debts accelerated during the moratorium will not receive such priority, other than in respect of amounts which already fell due during the moratorium. If a company enters administration within 12 weeks following the end of a moratorium, the administrator must make a distribution in respect of any unpaid moratorium debts, and those pre moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday during the moratorium and which are payable in priority over other claims in administration. Any person affected by the moratorium may challenge it on certain grounds, including that of unfair harm, at any time during the moratorium. _Restructuring Plan Procedure_ The CIGA inserts a new restructuring plan procedure into the Companies Act 2006. The new procedure is similar to a scheme of arrangement but with the added possibility of cross-class cram-down. A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including creditors, shareholders, administrators or liquidators). A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including creditors, shareholders, administrators or liquidators). The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies; the company need only have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern. 164 ----- This standalone restructuring option is generally available to companies with a sufficient connection to the United Kingdom. The CIGA includes a power for the Secretary of State to exclude companies providing financial services, pursuant to secondary legislation. The process closely resembles that of schemes of arrangement. At the first hearing, the court will examine the constitution of classes as proposed by the plan proponent. Subject to the requisite voting thresholds being met, at a second hearing, the court will consider if the necessary requirements have been met (including the requirements for a cross-class cram-down, if applicable) and will consider whether to sanction the restructuring plan. For a class of stakeholders to approve the plan, at least 75% in value, of those voting, must vote in favor. The plan may still be confirmed by the court even where certain classes do not vote in favor, provided that: - the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative”; and - at least one class who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan. The court may decline to sanction the plan if it does not consider it would be just and equitable to do so. The “relevant alternative” for this purpose is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the plan were not sanctioned. Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan. If a company were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property is applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest account for the relevant indebtedness; - _Second ranking: prescribed fees and expenses of the official receiver; - _Third ranking: where winding-up procedures are begun within 12 weeks following the end of any (new, stand-alone) moratorium (see further below), unpaid moratorium debts and unpaid priority pre-moratorium debts; - _Fourth ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are-paid); - _Fifth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. 165 ----- Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts are limited to (a) certain categories of bank account deposits, and (b) claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts and, as between one another, the categories of bank account deposits rank before the HMRC claims; - _Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - _Seventh ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the notes or the guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency from the date of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company.

It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction the English company is unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company gives the preference ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into.

Only with prior approval of the court can an administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the gross proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. There is a possibility that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.” See also “—Administrative Receivership.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is a risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with the English Guarantor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Guarantor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Guarantor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable”. Under the Companies Act, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including security not governed by English law) granted by a company (together with prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for registration within 21-days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the 21-day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of the company. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. 170 ----- In the event that the relevant security document is not registered, the company may be required to enter into a new security document and register it with Companies House within 21-days of its creation. Alternatively, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order allowing the charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be made by the company or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security.

Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer party to the European regime for reciprocal recognition of insolvency proceedings or civil/commercial judgments under the EU Insolvency Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation, respectively. The prospects of recognition of such proceedings or judgments in cases involving the United Kingdom and the remaining European member states will need to be carefully considered in each case and may vary significantly between member states. The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) (which has been implemented in the United Kingdom by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 and in a number of other jurisdictions), provides for recognition of insolvency proceedings in other jurisdictions as either foreign main or foreign non-main proceedings. English insolvency proceedings in relation to the English Guarantor may be recognized as foreign main proceedings in other jurisdictions which have implemented the Model Law if the English Guarantor has its “center of main interests” in England. If the English Guarantor is found to have its “center of main interests” in a place other than England, the English insolvency proceedings may only be afforded recognition as foreign non-main proceedings provided that the English Guarantor is found to have an establishment in England (meaning that it has a place of operations in England and carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). In that case, the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantor will occur in the place in which the English Guarantor is found to have its “center of main interests.” English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12 months’ forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter _Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in_ Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or over indebtedness (Überschuldung), each managing director of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders or members of the supervisory board (if established), are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or six weeks after such over indebtedness (Überschuldung) occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings or for restructuring proceedings (see “Preventive Restructuring Framework”) in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they_ fall due at some point in time within a prognosis period of usually 24 months, whereas imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020 (as amended from time to time, the “COVInsAG”), provides, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until, currently, April 30, 2021. The suspension – as in force from January 1, 2021 – applies to debtors who, in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020, have applied for financial assistance under state assistance programs to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or have been prevented, as eligible debtors, from filing such application for legal or factual reasons, unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of obtaining the state financial assistance or the assistance that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the over-indebtedness or illiquidity. 172 ----- A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung), if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turn-around plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit)_ and/or is over-indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for preliminary “debtor in possession” protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), unless—from a third party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger _Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). It may also_ implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During the period of either the preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige _Eigenverwaltung) or the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor shall prepare an_ insolvency plan, which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). In particular, the insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings (other than with respect to immoveable assets) or, to the extent required to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business, prohibit the enforcement of any collateral granted over claims, rights or other movable assets of debtor. If the enforcement of collateral is prohibited by the insolvency court, secured creditors have to be adequately compensated by the insolvency estate. Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will also supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary trustee or preliminary administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator or preliminary trustee may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), whilst in debtor-in-possession proceedings, the debtor’s management retains the right to manage business. However, the court may also order that certain disposals of the debtor may require the preliminary trustee’s (vorläufiger Sachwalter) consent also in debtor-in-possession proceedings. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three requirements: - a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted); - revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding the filing; and/or - fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis (including, inter alios, part time employees). The requirements apply to the entity subject to the proceedings without taking into account the assets of other group companies. The preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) / preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) / trustee (Sachwalter); and court orders for “debtor in possession” proceedings (Anordnung _der Eigenverwaltung)._ The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been 173 ----- filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Unless the court has granted “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste _Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_ of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the appointment. The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings, the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any unsecured insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including, e.g., the Notes Guarantees. Residual claims of a secured insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the respective collateral (if any) also qualify as unsecured insolvency claim in this regard. However, in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor shall only incur estate liabilities in the ordinary course of business without the trustee’s (Sachwalter) consent. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (or trustee (Sachwalter) in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings) may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent _Transfer”)._ For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings over the assets of any German Notes Guarantor would include, among possible voidance actions and other things, the following: (a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of a German Notes Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate; (b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by a German Notes Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; (c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the relevant insolvency debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (d) claims against any the relevant debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and (e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute a part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter). Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency and restructuring law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, 174 ----- upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or restructuring proceedings or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency or restructuring proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid in case of insolvency proceedings if such clause would frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless such clause only reflects termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, also unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question. That having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) views the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) competent to realize pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are hold in a custodian account (Depot) in Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share capital of the pledged company. It therefore appears likely that in this particular case, secured creditors would not be held competent to realize the respective share pledges. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Ersatzabsonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9% (or as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least 4%) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) (being the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) and the insolvency court as well as the members of the (preliminary) creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the collateral securing the Notes (if any)). If a German Notes Guarantor or a subsidiary thereof subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes by the German Notes Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied. 175 ----- The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator or, in debtor-in-possession proceedings, by the trustee (upon instruction of the preliminary creditors’ committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. The insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) may derogate from the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge of secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create, modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor can also be included in the insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to third parties or to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) could under certain circumstances provide for provisions, inter alia, regarding the Notes Guarantees which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of obligations under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees. Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-for-equity swap under the proposed insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other security interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor affiliates being required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided that the relevant debtor affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such impairment are entitled to receive adequate compensation. This means that the claims under the Notes Guarantees can get impaired if the Issuers or a German Guarantor would enter into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or not the relevant German Guarantor is itself subject of insolvency proceedings. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has provisions to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they stipulate four key measures in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand); (ii) a single person may be appointed as insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) for all relevant group companies; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees, and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht). As a general principle, the claims arising from the Notes Guarantee may be enforced against a German Notes Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the relevant German Notes Guarantor. Any insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer or a Guarantor would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause other Guarantors or other affiliated companies to subsequently file for insolvency. German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions, but except for government developments banks and its affiliates). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a “shareholder like” position (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). 176 ----- In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor, the claims arising from a Notes Guarantee could be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. _Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_ Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or, in the event that debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable voidance periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or, as the case may be, a trustee (Sachwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If the validity or enforceability of the Notes, the respective Notes Guarantees or any collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made under the Notes, the Notes Guarantee or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases. (a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; (b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (b) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (c) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such transaction for other creditors; (c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is 177 ----- obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or such filing at the time of the transaction (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings; (d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a guarantee) for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings; (e) any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the insolvency creditors if the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was at least imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. For granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, such knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. Apart_ from that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a rebuttable presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the creditor or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment (Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he had no knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction. (f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party (nahestehende Person), as described below, which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; (g) any act that grants security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim under a shareholder loan granted to the debtor or an equivalent claim if (i) in the case of the granting of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. This does not apply (i) to shareholders that own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and (ii) until the sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity with the intension to restructure the debtor; and (h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction to a third party for a loan claim or an equivalent claim if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security for such loan or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) for such loan (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that, e.g., the respective debtor (e.g., a German Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending restructuring proceedings (see Preventive Restructuring Framework) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be 178 ----- deemed to have such “knowledge.” A person is further deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). With respect to an “affiliated party” (nahestehende _Person) as described below there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge” as indicated_ above. In relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons. The granting of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances it may not be subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg). According to recent case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, this privilege does not apply to claims as described under (vii) above. Any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and respective collateral as well as shareholder loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions, which have been granted from March 1, 2020 until September 30, 2020 are privileged under German insolvency law due to the CovInsAG, provided that the statutory insolvency filing obligation of the debtor has been suspended pursuant to the CovInsAG or the debtor would not have been obliged to file irrespective of the CovInsAG. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing duties at the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021). Loans granted, and security taken, by certain public institutions as part of COVID-19 subsidies remain privileged even if granted or taken after that period. The general privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts. Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see —“Preventive Restructuring _Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the_ debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof. This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral provided therefor. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor if (i) such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings (see Preventive Restructuring Framework) per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by a delayed filing for insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. If, however, such additional funding has been provided or existing funding has been extended or respective collateral has been granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), any such transaction is statutorily exempted from the lender liability concept as laid out above, provided that the statutory insolvency filing obligation of the debtor has been suspended pursuant to the CovInsAG or the debtor would not have been obliged to file irrespective of the CovInsAG. 179 ----- Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. However, the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts is suspended in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing duties at the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), provided that the statutory insolvency filing obligation of the debtor has been suspended pursuant to the CovInsAG or the debtor would not have been obliged to file irrespective of the CovInsAG.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,266,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES,266.4,Germany,266.4.2,Preventive Restructuring Framework,"The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG). Based on the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring Directive”) the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into force on January 1, 2021. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “centre of main interest” is located in Germany. This may apply as of the date of this Offering Memorandum to the German Guarantors. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, no corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and consequently any proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with uncertainty. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring proceedings by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its centre of main interest in Germany would be in particular the following: - potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings; - any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes) with a majority of 75% of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other classes under certain presumptions; - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims, or, if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a moratorium. _Restructuring Proceedings_ Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the competent restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible to file for restructuring proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). As a statutory general rule, such imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due within a two years’ look-forward period. 180 ----- During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager, which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor has to refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the envisaged restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings. During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However, if such an insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly without undue delay. The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the restructuring courts discretion, (i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or overindebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to the restructuring plan provided the achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains predominantly likely. Once restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor is again obliged to file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If (i) the envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the settlement of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by the restructuring court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/or shareholders are to be compromised). The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) any person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective individual case and who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor, creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is, based on expert opinion provided by an Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see“—Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a mandatory restructuring officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of creditors, the restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own discretion. The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the procedure to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan and can be empowered by the restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive payments to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the proposed plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and restore the debtor’s viability. The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties independently and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory restructuring officer. The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex officio or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition. Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan. Creditors may only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs of the optional restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the stakeholders involved in the negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An optional restructuring officer can also be removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition. 181 ----- Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate the restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g. if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of the occurrence of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account the actual status of the relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency proceedings is obviously not in the interest of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s filing. _Restructuring plan_ Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain selected or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other agreements to which more than the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms of and liabilities relating to the relevant debtor under the Indenture. Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor agreements can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne _Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors_ are adequately compensated. Consequently, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees could also be subject to a restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre of main interest” in Germany. Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law measures like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the shareholders’ consent but require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims as no creditor can be forced to take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if the Notes or Notes Guarantees were subject to a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders of the Notes could not be forced under the restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuers or a Guarantor without their respective consent. The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed by the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a (virtual) creditors’ meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the respective creditors’ economic interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors, unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors (e.g. shareholders) will form separate classes. However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings, could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by value of all claims of one class will be required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity requirement. Dissenting classes can be crammed down (or up), if (a) the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan (whereby the alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but can also be an alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis); (b) the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan; and (c) a majority of classes has accepted the plan. A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if (i) no other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in insolvency proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not covered by a respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari passu in insolvency proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under the restructuring plan (unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described under (ii) in the foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder retains equity without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly committed to the continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or the creditors’ rights are only compromised marginally (e.g. by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months). Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan. In case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected stakeholders before the plan can be confirmed. 182 ----- The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid (drohend _zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the procedure to adopt the_ restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon the restructuring court’s notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be expectedly worse off under the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant has already raised such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However, such application has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors that can prove to be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds. Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they are able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the restructuring plan and funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not suffice for their individual compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate implementation of the restructuring plan. Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation upon the restructuring proceedings being included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. This is expected to occur in July 2022. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such recognition has not yet been tested as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. _Moratorium_ In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by the competent court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors with regards to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten). The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors may still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated insolvency proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in particular if the requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not comply with certain statutory duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) the competent court may lift the moratorium, also on a creditor’s application. _Limitations on Enforcement_ Certain of the German Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH”). Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”) and other laws. These provisions would also apply to any future German Notes Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., _Gesellschaft_ _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung_ _&_ _Compagnie _Kommanditgesellschaft, GmbH & Co. KG”). German GmbH Limitation Language—General_ As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (meaning, assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German Generally Accepted Accounting 183 ----- Principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital) ; in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such provisions apply to the general partner which is a GmbH. The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH or by a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, certain credit agreements and guarantees to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture provided by the German Notes Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees, the Indenture is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. _German GmbH Limitation Language—Wording_ The limitation language for any GmbH to be incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents (as defined in “Description of the Notes”), in particular in the Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows: (a) Definitions In this paragraph: “AktG” means the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). “Auditor’s Determination” means the determination pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) below. “BGB” means the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB). “DPLA” means a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder _Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as defined in § 291 (1) AktG and applied mutatis mutandis to a GmbH._ “EU Guarantor” means any limited liability company (or limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner) incorporated in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose centre of main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is in Germany. “German Guarantor” means any GmbH Guarantor and any EU Guarantor. “GmbH” means a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbH) incorporated under German law. “GmbH Capital Impairment” means the GmbH Net Assets of a GmbH Guarantor falling below the amount (Entstehung einer Unterbilanz) required to maintain that GmbH Guarantor’s registered share capital (Stammkapital) or an increase of an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) and thereby violating §§ 30, 31 GmbHG. “GmbH Guarantor” means a Guarantor which is a GmbH. “GmbH Net Assets” means the net assets (Reinvermögen) of a GmbH Guarantor calculated in accordance with § 42 GmbHG, §§ 242, 264 HGB and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable (Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchführung) from time to time in Germany as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (b)(vi) below. “GmbHG” means the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften _mit beschränkter Haftung, GmbHG)._ “HGB” means the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). “InsO” means the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung, InsO). “Limited Obligation” means any guarantee and any other liability, indemnity or other payment obligation under any provision of the Notes Documents. 184 ----- “Limited Upstream Obligation” means any Limited Obligation if and to the extent such Limited Obligation secures or relates to liabilities which are owed by direct or indirect shareholders of the relevant German Guarantor (upstream) or subsidiaries of such shareholders (such subsidiaries not to include the relevant German Guarantor and the direct or indirect subsidiaries of that relevant German Guarantor) (cross-stream). “Liquidity Impairment” means a German Guarantor being deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its liabilities towards its creditors and thereby violating § 15b (5) InsO. “Management Notification” means the notification pursuant to paragraph (b)(iii) below. (b) GmbH Capital Impairment Limitation Language (i) Save as set out in this paragraph (b), the Holders and the Trustee shall not enforce, and any GmbH Guarantor (and/or the relevant subsidiary of a GmbH Guarantor, which itself is a guarantor) shall have a defense (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a complete or partial discharge (Erfüllung) or enforcement (Vollstreckung) in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment to occur. (ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply: (A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH Guarantor secures any indebtedness under any Notes Document in respect of: (1) amounts which are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant German Guarantor or its direct or indirect subsidiaires; or (2) bank guarantees or letters of credit (or comparable instruments) that are issued for the benefit of any of the creditors of the German Guarantor or the German Guarantor’s direct or indirect subsidiaires, in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph (ii) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced multiple times (no double dip); (B) if, at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation, a DPLA (either directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists between the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation as dominating company (herrschendes Unternehmen) and the relevant GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes Unternehmen), provided that: (1) the GmbH Guarantor is a direct or indirect subsidary of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or (2) the GmbH Guarantor and the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation are both subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company with such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen), in each case to the extent the relevant GmbH Guarantor has a fully valuable recourse claim (vollwertiger Verlustausgleichsanspruch) against the dominating company, unless a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) explicitly confirmed with reasons (and not, for example, as an obiter dictum) in a third party case that the mere existence of such DPLA leads to the inapplicability of § 30 (1) sentence 1 GmbHG; or (C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger _Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH Guarantor against the Issuer or the_ relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation. (iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within twenty (20) Business Days after the making of a demand against that GmbH Guarantor under the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation: 185 ----- (A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or indemnity; and (B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its GmbH Net Assets, providing an up-to-date pro forma balance sheet), then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been provided. (iv) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty-five (25) Business Days of its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within sixty-five (65) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the Auditors or any other auditors of international standard and reputation appointed by the GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set out under this paragraph (b). Save for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties. (v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions of the GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has substantially improved, the Trustee (acting reasonably) may, at the GmbH Guarantor’s cost and expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such Auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s Determination prior to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent the Auditors determine that the Capital Impairment have been cured. (vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows: (A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant GmbH Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant GmbH Guarantor became a party to any of the Indenture and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant GmbH Guarantor if it is permitted under the Notes Documents or has been carried out with the prior written consent of the Trustee; (B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; (C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; (D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB shall not be included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and (E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly negligent violation of the Notes Documents shall not be taken into account as liabilities. (vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b) that the Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize, to the extent lawful and within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and are not necessary for the relevant GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht _betriebsnotwendig)._ (c) Liquidity Impairment Limitation Language (i) Save as set out in this paragraph (c), none of the Holders and the Trustee shall enforce, and any German Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against, any Limited Upstream Obligation if and to the extent a payment and/or enforcement in respect of a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a Liquidity Impairment for such German Guarantor. 186 ----- (ii) Paragraphs (b)(iii), (b)(iv), (b)(v) and (b)(vii) above shall apply mutatis mutandis to the restriction in paragraph (i) above. (d) Where the provisions of this Section apply to a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft), all references to the assets of a German Guarantor shall mutatis mutandis include a reference to the assets of the general partner (Komplementär) of such limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft). (e) In addition to the restrictions set out in paragraphs (b) through (d) above, if a German Guarantor demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the payment under and/ or enforcement of any Limited Upstream Obligation against such German Guarantor would result in personal liability of its managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) or director(s) (Vorstände) for a reimbursement of payments made under any Limited Upstream Obligation (including, without limitation, pursuant to § 43 GmbHG and/or § 826 BGB), the German Guarantor shall have a defence (Einrede) against the Limited Upstream Obligation to the extent required in order not to incur such liability. (f) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream Obligation granted by a German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are owed by that German Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited under this paragraph. (g) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming in court that payments under paragraph/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligations do or do not fall within the scope of §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG, § 15b InsO, and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable) or that the limitations set out in this Section are not required to avoid any violation of these laws or liability issues for any managing director or board director. (h) Nothing in this Section shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under the Indenture or any other Notes Document to the Trustee or vice versa. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, this paragraph and any rights and/or obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law. German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to Sections 30, 31 GmbHG and Section 15b InsO, are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Notes Guarantors to make payments on the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or the enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (meaning, a situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the German Notes Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Notes Guarantees or any Collateral by the German Notes Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the stated share capital of a grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (for example, the provision or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. 187 ----- On June 20, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring Directive”) has been adopted. The Restructuring Directive was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 26, 2019, and the member states have approximately two years to transpose the substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one year extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which claims of the relevant creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of only 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers and against the voting of a single creditor in a pre-insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings. The Restructuring Directive also provides for cross class cram down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing. _Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_ The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. The CovInsAG, however, suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 and where the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the centre of main interest of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency proceedings over the German Notes Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions, in particular if such assets are located in another Member State of the European Union.

Prawo restrukturyzacyjne (tekst _jednolity: Dz. U. z 2020 roku, poz. 814, ze zm.)). Enforceability of decisions issued by foreign courts_ In the event of subjecting the Polish Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee to the laws of foreign country in a dispute before a Polish court, only substantive laws of that foreign law will be applied while the laws of procedure will be governed by Polish law. Furthermore, as a rule, Polish courts can refuse to apply or execute foreign legal provisions, if the application of such provisions results in the contravention of peremptory rules of Polish public policy, or if specific law has to be applied regardless of the choice of law (meaning, should any rights in rem be involved, they will be subject to the laws of the country in which the subject of these rights is located). As a general rule, the decisions of Polish courts become final and non-appealable after execution of appropriate remedy path or after the expiry of the statutory term to file a remedy, subject to applicability of extraordinary legal remedies if available. The enforcement of decisions of foreing courts in Poland is subject to treaties and conventions to which Poland is a party and the rules of the Polish Civil Procedure Code. The decisions issued by foreign courts, as the general rule, become enforceable in Poland after establishing their enforceability by the Polish court. There is no treaty between the United States and Poland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements (other than arbitration awards) rendered in civil matters. Therefore, any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in the United States in a civil matter would be recognized and enforced in the courts of Poland in accordance with the Polish Civil Procedure Code. As a general rule of the Polish Civil Procedure Code, judgments of foreign courts in civil cases are recognized by virtue of law, however, a judgment cannot be recognized in Poland if: - it is not final and binding in the state where it was issued; - it was issued in a case which belongs to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Polish courts; - a defendant, who has not argue the merits of the case, has not been duly and timely served with the complaint initiating the proceedings and consequently has been unable to defend themselves; - the party was deprived of the possibility of defending itself in judicial proceedings; - an action concerning the same claim between the same parties had been brought before a court in Poland before it was brought before a court of a foreign state; - it contradicts an earlier final and binding judgment of a Polish court or an earlier final and binding judgment of a foreign court satisfying the conditions for its recognition in Poland, which was rendered in a case concerning the same claim between the same parties; or - its recognition would contradict the fundamental principles of the legal order of Poland (the public order clause). Any party wishing to have a U.S. judgment enforceable in Poland must file an application seeking declaration of enforceability of the U.S. judgment which must be filed with the relevant Polish district court (sa˛d okre˛gowy). As a general rule, the decisions of the courts of other EU member states do not need to be declared enforceable by the Polish courts, prior to their enforcement in Poland. Enforceability of these decisions may be challenged, however, in a separate proceedings before the Polish court. As a general rule, decisions of the Polish courts (including on issuance of enforceability clause) and appropriate actions of enforcement officers with whom the enforcement of claims is sought may be, depending on the circumstances, required for the enforcement of the given security interest. 189 ----- Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union, (with effect from January 1, 2021) the judgements of English courts are recognized and are enforceable in Poland in accordance with, and subject to the conditions of, the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements (the “Hague Convention”), provided that the choice of court clause contained in the relevant document is considered as exclusive within the meaning of the Hague Convention. Otherwise, such judgement will be recognized in Poland in accordance with the Polish Civil Procedure Code pursuant to the rules presented above with respect to the United States. _Polish insolvency law considerations_ Obligations of the Polish Guarantor under the Notes Guarantees and satisfaction of creditors’ calims under the Note Guarantees are subject to limitations resulting from the application of provisions of the Polish Bankruptcy Law and Polish Restructuring Law, as well as limitations resulting from provisions regarding protection of share capital as further described under the heading “Limitations Resulting from the Polish Commercial Code” below. _Insolvency and Insolvency Threat_ Pursuant to Polish Bankruptcy Law and EU Insolvency Regulation, bankruptcy proceedings of the Polish Guarantor should be conducted before a Polish court if its “center of main interest” is in Poland. Consequently, in the event of the insolvency of such Polish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings would be governed by Polish law. Similarly, in the event of such Polish Guarantor’s insolvency or its threat, restructuring proceedings would also be subject to Polish law. According to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Polish Guarantor will be declared bankrupt if it is insolvent. The Polish Guarantor as a debtor will be insolvent: (i) if it has lost its ability to fulfill its due pecuniary liabilities (wymagalne zobowia˛zania pienie˛z˙ne) (cash flow test). The inability to fulfill the due pecuniary liabilities is presumed to arise, if the delay in fulfilling pecuniary obligations exceeds three months), or (ii) its pecuniary liabilities (except for future liabilities and those to shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect, granted within five years before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed the total value of its assets (except for assets not constituting the bankruptcy estate) and such situation persists for longer than 24 months (balance sheet test). It is presumed that the pecuniary liabilities of the debtor exceed its assets if, according to the balance sheet, its liabilities (except for reserves for liabilities and liabilities to affiliates) exceed the value of its assets and such situation persists beyond 24 months. Despite meeting the balance sheet test by the Polish Guarantor, the Polish Bankruptcy Law allows the court dismissing an application for bankruptcy if there is no threat of losing ability by the Polish Guarantor to fulfill its due pecuniary liabilities in near future. Each individual who has the right to represent the Polish Guarantor (whether individually or jointly) is obliged to file a motion to declare the Polish Guarantor bankrupt within 30 days from when the grounds for declaration of bankruptcy above are met. Under the Anti-Crisis Act Regarding COVID-19, debtors whose insolvency occurred between 14 March 2020 and the date on which the state of epidemiological threat or epidemic in Poland was cancelled, are temporarily exempt from the obligation to file a petition for bankruptcy if their insolvency was due to COVID-19 (it is presumed that the insolvency was a result of COVID-19 if it arose during the state of epidemiological threat or epidemic). After cancellation of the state of epidemiological threat or epidemic, the 30-day deadline for filing a petition for bankruptcy shall run anew. Additionally, the Polish Guarantor’s personal creditors may file for bankruptcy of the Polish Guarantor. According to the Polish Restructuring Law, restructuring proceedings may be opened in respect of the Polish Guarantor as debtor if it is insolvent or will be threatened with insolvency, i.e., if its commercial position shows that it may become insolvent within a short period of time. If the Polish Guarantor is insolvent or threatened with insolvency, it may file a restructuring motion. If the Polish Guarantor is insolvent, a restructuring motion to open remedial proceedings may be filed by the Polish Guarantor’s personal creditors. 190 ----- If a motion for declaration of bankruptcy and motion for opening restructuring proceedings have both been filed, the court should first decide on the restructuring motion and put on hold the proceedings on the motion for bankruptcy (unless putting them on hold would be against the interests of all creditors). The debtor cannot be declared bankrupt during restructuring proceedings. _Bankruptcy Proceedings_ The principal aim of bankruptcy proceedings is the satisfaction of the creditors from the proceeds obtained from the sale of the debtor’s assets. In the event of bankruptcy proceedings, the court appoints a bankruptcy receiver (syndyk) who takes over the management of the bankrupt’s assets. From this moment on, the management of a debtor–bankrupt entity is replaced by the bankruptcy receiver who administers the bankrupt entity’s assets and represents the bankrupt entity. The bankrupt entity’s assets become bankruptcy assets which will be liquidated to pay off creditors. The composition of bankruptcy assets is determined during preparation of the inventory list and creditors’ receivables list which are prepared by the bankruptcy receiver. A motion for approval of the terms of sale of the debtor’s enterprise or its organized part, or substantial part of its assets, may be appended to the petition to commence bankruptcy proceedings (pre-packaged liquidation). Upon the bankruptcy declaration all of the debtor’s debts become due and payable and non-pecuniary debts are converted to pecuniary and become due and payable. Interest may be paid from the bankruptcy estate only for the period up to the date of the declaration of bankruptcy, unless they are secured by mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages, and satisfied from the security assets’ proceeds. The bankrupt’s claim may be set off against a creditor’s claim if both claims existed on the date of declaration of bankruptcy, regardless of whether the claims have not yet become due and payable. A set-off is not admissible if the bankrupt’s debtor acquired the claim by assignment or endorsement after bankruptcy was declared or acquired it during the year preceding the date of declaration of bankruptcy, while being aware that there were grounds for declaring bankruptcy. However, this limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has become the bankrupt’s creditor as a result of repaying the bankrupt’s debt, for which it was liable personally or with certain property items, and if the acquirer was not aware of the existence of grounds for declaring bankruptcy at the time of assuming liability for the bankrupt’s debt or (ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year before the date on which bankruptcy was declared. The set off is also not admissible if bankrupt’s creditor become bankrupt’s debtor after the date of declaration of bankruptcy. The sum proposed to be set off on the part of the bankrupt is the total of the bankrupt’s claim and on the part of the creditor it is the creditor’s principal claim only, along with interests accrued until the date of declaration bankruptcy. If the bankrupt’s debt without interest had not become due and payable by the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the sum to be set-off is the amount due reduced by statutory interest (which may not exceed six percent) between the date of declaration of bankruptcy until the date of payment, and may not exceed two years. A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right must make a statement in this respect not later than when submitting the claim. Once bankruptcy is declared, the bankrupt entity’s assets may not be subject to security, charged with a pledge, registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers may be made to establish any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such entry had been filed at least six months prior to filing the motion for bankruptcy. Provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party which explicitly stipulate that the agreement is amended or terminated in the case its bankruptcy (or filing for it) are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the bankrupt company is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the bankruptcy proceedings from being achieved will be deemed ineffective in relation to the bankruptcy estate. These specific provisions of Polish Bankruptcy Law are deemed to apply also to contracts that are subject to laws other than the laws of Poland, as long as the provisions of such contract would apply to an entity that is subject to bankruptcy proceedings under the Polish Bankruptcy Law. If court proceedings against the bankrupt entity are pending on the day of the bankruptcy declaration in any common courts, then such proceedings are in some cases discontinued. In particular, in the bankruptcy proceedings, unless separate statutory laws provide otherwise, proceedings initiated against the bankrupt before the date of declaration of bankruptcy concerning a claim which was submitted within the bankruptcy proceedings may be continued only if this claim has not been included in the list of claims (see below) once this list was finalised. If proceedings were pending in which the bankrupt entity was the plaintiff, the bankruptcy receiver replaces the bankrupt entity. If enforcement proceedings regarding the claims which may be submitted within the 191 ----- bankruptcy proceedings were pending against the bankrupt entity on the day of bankruptcy declaration, they are suspended with effect from the date of the bankruptcy declaration and proceeds received are transferred to the bankruptcy estate after the decision on the declaration of bankruptcy becomes final. If the arbitration proceedings were not commenced on the date of declaration of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy receiver may with the consent of the judge-commissioner renounce the arbitration clauses if the arbitration proceedings hinder the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate. If the bankruptcy receiver renounces the arbitration clause it expires. Creditors have a right to submit their claims within the time limit indicated in a decision declaring bankruptcy. Claims supported by evidence of claims are usually admitted, i.e., included in the list of claims. If a claim is not included in the list, then a creditor has a right to appeal. Under the Polish Bankruptcy Law, any debt payable in a currency other than Polish złoty, if being put on the list of claims, must be converted into Polish złoty according to the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate prevailing on the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has fallen due or not). In the bankruptcy proceedings, creditors under the Note Guarantees will be satisfied from the proceeds obtained from the sale of the Polish Guarantor’s assets if their claim under the Note Guarantees is due and payable, otherwise the proceeds of that sale will be deposited in the court deposit in their favor and released once their claim under the Note Guarantees becomes due and payable and not satisfied. As a rule, Polish Guarantor’s debts are divided into four categories and creditors whose receivables are ranked in a lower category cannot be satisfied before all the debts in the higher category have been fully satisfied. The first category principally includes payments to the state or employees (remuneration, health benefit payments and social security obligations, etc.) or related to the restructuring proceedings (including arising under a credit facility, loan, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit, or other form of financing envisaged in the arrangement concluded in the restructuring proceedings and provided in connection with the arrangement’s performance). Most unsecured commercial debts, tax and other public dues are listed in the second category. The third category encompasses interest on debts in the first and second categories (in the order in which the principal is satisfied), court or administrative penalties, donations etc. The fourth category concerns debts to direct and certain indirect shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect that were granted within five years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy including interest accrued thereon. Within a category, each creditor’s receivable is satisfied pro rata to the total value of receivables listed in that category. Before satisfying any claims, the bankruptcy receiver covers the costs of bankruptcy proceedings and the liabilities of the bankruptcy estate. The Polish Bankruptcy Law does not require a bankruptcy receiver to give effect to intercreditor arrangements such as subordination agreements. Although the law does not preclude creditors from attempting to enforce such rights in separate proceedings based on their entitlements arising from respective contracts, such proceedings are conducted outside of and following bankruptcy proceedings. Therefore, the claims of all unsecured creditors may be paid on a pari passu basis in bankruptcy proceedings. If an asset owned by the bankrupt entity (the Polish Guarantor) is encumbered with a mortgage, pledge, registry pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage, then a creditor has a right to be satisfied from that asset before other creditors (with a few exceptions such as, for instance, a certain portion of employee salaries). Where a number of mortgages or pledges have been established on a real estate or the object of the pledge, creditors are repaid from according to their priority. The pledgee under the registered pledge or financial pledge may seize the pledged object if the relevant pledge agreement provides for such method of satisfaction of creditor’s claim. However, seizure is not allowed if such object is the part of bankrupt’s enterprise and the sale of such object with the rest of the enterprise is more beneficial than its separate sale. In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, an arrangement between the debtor and creditors can be voted on and approved by the creditors. In such case after the approval by the court, the provisions of the arrangement determine the manner of satisfaction of creditors’ receivables. If the repayment of receivables arising under the Note Guarantees are covered by the arrangement, there is a possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Bankruptcy Law). A creditor who fails to satisfy his claim during bankruptcy proceedings may try to raise this claim directly against persons acting on behalf of the Polish Guarantor being a limited liability company. Pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies if enforcement against a company proves to be ineffective, members of the management board of a limited liability company shall be jointly and severally liable for the company’s liabilities. A member 192 ----- of the management board may be discharged from liability referred to above if he proves that the bankruptcy petition was filed in a timely manner or in the appropriate time the decision on the opening of the restructuring proceedings or the approval of the arrangement in the approval arrangement proceedings were issued, or that a failure to file a bankruptcy petition occurred through no fault on his part or that despite the failure to file a bankruptcy petition or to issue the decision on the opening of the restructuring proceedings or the decision on the approval the arrangement in the approval arrangement proceedings, the creditor suffered no additional damage. _Restructuring Proceedings_ Restructuring proceedings essentially aim to avoid the debtor’s bankruptcy through its debt restructuring under an arrangement with creditors and, in the event of remedial proceedings (poste˛powanie sanacyjne), also through remedial steps, while securing the justified rights of creditors. Restructuring proceedings may be initiated by a debtor’s motion, or, in case of remedial proceedings also on a debtor’s personal creditor’s motion, if the debtor is insolvent or threatened with insolvency. The court will refuse to open restructuring proceedings, if they are detrimental to creditors, or, in case of arrangement proceedings (poste˛powanie układowe) and remedial proceedings if the debtor’s ability to fund the costs of such proceedings and obligations arising after the date of opening of these proceedings cannot be substantiated. The debtor may request the opening of one of the four following restructuring proceedings: (i) approval arrangement proceedings, (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings; (iii) arrangement proceedings and (iv) remedial proceedings. In addition, in relation to COVID-19, on 24 June 2020, a new simplified restructuring proceeding entered into force and will be available until 30 June 2021. There are legislative work carried out to incorporate the simplified restructuring proceeding (with some amendments) to the Polish Restructuring Law. In the case of approval arrangement proceedings, the debtor solicits votes from creditors on a proposed arrangement without participation of the court. Once creditors have cast a sufficient number of votes, the debtor may apply to the court for approval of the arrangement. This type of proceedings is available when the sum of the disputed claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims. Accelerated arrangement proceedings are designed to allow a debtor to conclude an arrangement with the creditors following the preparation of a list of creditors’ receivables and its approval by a judge-commissioner in simplified proceedings. The procedure may be applied provided that the sum of disputed claims does not exceed 15% of the total claims. At the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings, the debtor’s assets constitute the arrangement estate. The arrangement estate is administered by the debtor, unless the court decides that an administrator should be appointed (e.g. if the debtor fails to perform the instructions of the judge-commissioner or the court supervisor). From the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings, the debtor or administrator (if appointed) cannot satisfy any creditors’ receivable which is covered by the arrangement, by operation of law. The enforcement proceedings concerning the claims to be covered by the arrangement are stayed by the operation of law. In arrangement proceedings, an arrangement may be concluded following the preparation of the list of creditors’ receivables and its approval by a judge-commissioner in ordinary proceedings. This procedure may be used when the sum of the disputed claims exceeds 15% of the total claims. As in accelerated arrangement proceedings, the assets of the debtor form the arrangement estate, which is administered by the debtor or administrator (if appointed). The debtor, or administrator (if appointed) also may not satisfy any debt which is covered by the arrangement, by operation of law. The enforcement proceedings concerning the claims to be covered by the arrangement are also stayed by the operation of law. Remedial proceedings allow a debtor to conclude an arrangement with creditors and undertake various remedial actions which aim to improve the economic situation of the debtor and restore the debtor’s capacity to perform his obligations. At the opening of remedial proceedings, the debtor is deprived of its right to administer its assets (from the opening of proceedings they constitute the remedial estate) and the assets are administered by a courtappointed administrator (unless the court allows the debtor to retain the right to administer the remedial estate). The administrator can undertake a number of restructuring steps, including renouncing a not performed mutual agreement, or challenging the effectiveness of certain acts undertaken by the debtor before filing the motion to open remedial proceedings. Upon opening of the remedial proceedings, the debtor or administrator are legally prohibited from making payments to satisfy claims which are covered by the arrangement. The enforcement proceedings are also stayed by the operation of law. 193 ----- The claim of the company which is subject to restructuring may be set off against a creditor’s claim if both claims existed on the date of opening of restructuring proceedings (other than the approval arrangement proceedings). However, the set-off is not admissible if (i) the creditor became a debtor or the debtor after the opening of the restructuring proceedings or (ii) the debtor of the company subject to restructuring acquired the claim against the company subject to restructuring by assignment or endorsement after opening of the restructuring proceedings and such claim came into existence prior to the opening of the restructuring proceedings. This limitation does not apply (i) if the acquirer has become the creditor of company subject to restructuring as a result of repaying such company’s debt, for which it was liable personally or with certain property items, and (ii) if the liability was assumed at least one year before the date of opening of the restructuring proceedings. Similarly, the set off is not permissible if the creditor of the company subject to restructuring become a debtor of such company after the opening of the restructuring proceedings. A creditor wishing to exercise the set-off right must make a statement within 30 days from opening of the restructuring proceedings and if the grounds for set off arose after that date, then within 30 days from arising of the ground for set off. Once the accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings or remedial proceedings are opened, the entity’s assets may not be encumbered with security, charged with a pledge, registry pledge or treasury pledge, and no entries in land and mortgage register or other registers may be made to establish any security interests, except for the entry of mortgage if the application of such entry had been filed at least six months prior to filing the motion for opening of the proceedings. Additionally, provisions of an agreement to which the debtor is a party which explicitly stipulate that the agreement is amended or terminated in the case of opening restructuring proceedings (or filing for it) (except for approval arrangement proceedings) are invalid. Also, provisions of an agreement to which the debtor is a party that hinder or prevent the aims of the restructuring proceedings from being achieved will be deemed ineffective in relation to the arrangement or remedial estate (as applicable). These specific provisions of the Polish Restructuring Law are deemed to apply also to contracts that are subject to laws other than the laws of Poland, as long as said provisions of such contract would apply to an entity that is subject to restructuring proceedings (other than approval arrangement proceedings) under the Polish Restructuring Law. If the arrangement proceedings or accelerated arrangement proceedings are opened with respect to the Polish Guarantor, then certain actions in court proceedings against the Polish Guarantor will require court supervisor’s consent. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables which are subject to arrangement were pending against the Polish Guarantor on the day of opening of such restructuring proceedings, they are suspended with effect from the opening of such proceedings and proceeds received are transferred to the arrangement estate after the issuance of decision on opening of the restructuring proceedings. The creditor secured with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge and/or maritime mortgage can conduct the enforcement only with respect to the object of such security interest. The court may also stay enforcement of the claim which is not subject to the arrangement for the period of up to three months if such enforcement concerns the object which is necessary to run Polish Guarantor’s enterprise. In the case of opening of the remedial proceedings against the Polish Guarantor, if proceedings were pending in which the Polish Guarantor was the plaintiff, the administrator replaces the Polish Guarantor. If enforcement proceedings regarding the receivables were pending against the Polish Guarantor on the day of opening of the remedial proceeding, they are suspended and proceeds received are transferred to the remedial estate after the issuance of decision on the opening of the remedial proceedings. If creditors vote in favor of an arrangement, the arrangement is accepted and then approved by the court. The court’s decision approving the arrangement may be appealed against. An approved arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors, whose receivables are covered by the arrangement. Certain receivables are not covered (affected) by the arrangement. These include, among other things: (i) receivables secured with mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages, however only up to the value of the collateral (to the extent they can be satisfied from the security assets on which such security was established); a creditor whose claims are so secured may, however, consent to being subject to arrangement, (ii) receivables under derivative or repo transactions, and (iii) receivables under employment contracts. The arrangement may also concern only certain types of receivables (partial arrangement). In such case, the arrangement is binding on (affects) all creditors who have receivables of such type. In a partial arrangement, there are several exceptions to the general rule that receivables secured by mortgages, pledges, registered pledges, treasury pledges and/or maritime mortgages are not covered by the arrangement, without the consent of the creditor, up to the value of the collateral. The consent of the creditor is not required, if the arrangement’s initial proposals envisage full satisfaction of the creditor within the timeframe specified in the arrangement, or if they envisage satisfaction to an extent not less than may be expected from the collateral. 194 ----- If the receivables arising under the Note Guarantees are covered by the arrangement, there is a possibility that such receivables may be decreased on the basis of a decision of the creditors (such decisions would be subject to certain mandatory rules of the Polish Restructuring Law). A simplified restructuring proceeding is a hybrid of solutions provided for in other restructuring proceedings. It is for the most part extrajudicial and refers to the approval arrangement proceedings regulated in the Polish Restructuring Law, but with significant modifications. A simplified restructuring proceeding is opened automatically by publishing an announcement in the judicial and commercial gazette “Monitor Sa˛dowy i _Gospodarczy”, indicating the debtor’s details, the arrangement date, and the arrangement supervisor. Before_ making an announcement, the debtor prepares and submits to the selected arrangement supervisor arrangement proposals, a list of claims, and a list of disputed claims. As in the approval arrangement proceedings, the debtor, with the help of a restructuring adviser, presents creditors with arrangement proposals, collects their votes and, only at the end, applies to the court for approval of the arrangement, which has already been voted on. A creditors’ meeting to vote on the arrangement may be conducted remotely using electronic communications. The application for approval of the arrangement must be submitted to the court no later than four months after the announcement in “Monitor Sa˛dowy i Gospodarczy”. If no application for approval is filed within this period, the proceedings will be discontinued by operation of law. During the period from the date of making an announcement on opening the simplified restructuring procedure to the date of completion or discontinuance, existing enforcement proceedings are suspended by operation of law and no new proceedings may be instigated against the debtor. In addition, during the period of simplified restructuring, it is prohibited to terminate key agreements concluded with the debtor, including rental, tenancy, leasing or loan agreements, without the arrangement supervisor’s permission. There is also a ban, known from the accelerated arrangement procedure, on payment of claims covered by the arrangement by operation of law, as well as restrictions on setoff. Another new feature is the possibility to include in the arrangement a claim secured against the debtor’s assets without the secured creditor’s consent. Any creditor may apply to the court for lifting in its entirety of the effects of the announcement of the opening of a simplified restructuring proceeding, including the prohibition of enforcement against the debtor’s assets. Creditors will also be entitled to pursue a claim for redress of damages if the debtor made an announcement on the opening of proceedings in bad faith. _Limitations and Effectiveness of the Note Guarantees in Bankruptcy or Restructuring Proceedings_ Pursuant to Article 11 sec. 2 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law, a corporate entity is deemed to be insolvent if its pecuniary liabilities (except for future liabilities and those to shareholders relating to loans and legal acts of similar effect, granted within five years before the declaration of bankruptcy) exceed the total value of its assets (except for assets not constituting the bankruptcy estate) and such situation persists for longer than 24 months. Given certain legal controversies regarding the application of this rule, and in order to mitigate the possibility that the Polish Guarantor could be declared bankrupt under this rule, the liability of any Polish Guarantor on account of payments under the Note Guarantees shall be limited to the amount equivalent to the Polish Guarantor’s assets (except for assets which do not form part of the estate subject to bankruptcy). This limitation of liability will no longer apply when the Polish Guarantor becomes insolvent in the meaning of Article 11 of the Polish Bankruptcy Law or upon acceleration of the receivables under the Note Guarantees (in spite of the previous application of that limitation of liability). Under the Polish Bankruptcy Law, the Note Guarantees may be declared ineffective or deemed to be ineffective in certain situations. In particular, the enforceability of the receivables arising under the Note Guarantees in the insolvency proceedings depends on whether it was granted at least six months before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy of the Polish Guarantor and, furthermore, whether the secured receivables are due and payable. Pursuant to the Polish Bankruptcy Law, if: (i) the debt secured by the Note Guarantees is not due (dług _niewymagalny); and (ii) the Note Guarantees were granted within six months before the filing of the motion for_ bankruptcy, then it will be deemed ineffective. However, in such case, the creditor may bring an action or charge in order to seek the recognition of the Note Guarantees as effective if at the time when the same was granted the creditor was unaware of the existence of grounds for declaration of bankruptcy of the grantor. Furthermore, if the Note Guarantees are granted within six months preceding the date of the filing of the motion for bankruptcy, it will be assessed whether the Note Guarantees in this state of facts was granted by the bankrupt entity to its partners or shareholders, their representatives or spouses of the same, or affiliates, their partners or shareholders, representatives, or spouses of the same as well as with another company, in the event of either being the controlling company. If so, the Note Guarantees will be declared ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate, unless the other party is able to prove that it is not detrimental to other creditors. 195 ----- The disposals made by the bankrupt in respect of its estate (czynnos´ci prawne, którymi upadły rozporza˛dził _swoim maja˛tkiem) within one year before the filing of the motion for bankruptcy will be deemed ineffective_ towards the bankruptcy estate if the value of the disposal significantly (raz˙a˛co) exceeded consideration for the bankrupt, or there was no consideration for the bankrupt. It is not entirely clear under the Polish Bankruptcy Law whether the guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions since it is debatable whether they can be qualified as disposals. Under the Polish Restructuring Law, the Note Guarantees may also be declared ineffective or deemed ineffective in certain situations. The disposals made by the debtor in respect of its estate (czynnos´ci prawne, którymi upadły rozporza˛dził swoim _maja˛tkie) within one year before the filing of the motion for remedial proceedings will be deemed ineffective_ towards the remedial estate if the value of the disposal materially (istotnie) exceeded consideration for the debtor or third party, or there was no consideration for the debtor. It is not entirely clear under the Polish Restructuring Law whether the guarantees are subject to such clawback provisions since it is debatable whether they can be qualified as disposals. Additionally, pursuant to the Polish Restructuring Law, if: (i) the Note Guarantees were granted within one year before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings; and (ii) the Note Guarantees were not granted directly in connection with consideration received by the Polish Guarantor, then the Note Guarantees will be ineffective towards the remedial estate. The Note Guarantees will be ineffective towards the remedial estate in the part in which it exceeds (as at the date of granting the Note Guarantees) the value of the secured claim together with ancillary claims specified in the document establishing the Note Guarantees by more than a half, and provided that the Note Guarantees were granted within a year before the filing of the motion for opening restructuring proceedings. _Actio Pauliana_ Polish civil law provides a basis for declaring some actions done to the detriment of creditors ineffective (so-called “actio Pauliana”). In general, if as a result of a legal act performed by a debtor to the detriment of creditors, a third party gains a financial benefit, each of the creditors may demand that the said act be declared ineffective with respect to him, if the debtor acted knowingly to the creditors’ detriment, and the third party knew or, having used due care, could have learned of it. This provision applies accordingly if the debtor acts with an intention to harm future creditors. It is assumed that the debtor’s legal act is performed to the creditors’ detriment if, as a result of such act, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes insolvent to a greater degree than he was before performing the act (as described in Supreme Court judgements Case No. II CSK 548/11, Case No. III CSK 143/16, Case No. III CSK 214/11). The application to the court with respect to “actio Pauliana” can be filed within five years from the date of the act but not longer than within two years from the opening of insolvency proceedings (if a debtor has been declared bankrupt). _Limitation on Enforcement_ Under Polish law, claims may become time-barred (being the six years general term established for claims and three years term for claims pertaining to periodical performances and claims resulting from an economic activity; however the end of the period of limitation shall fall on the last day of the calendar year) according to the Polish Civil Code, or may be, or may become, subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. In the case of tort claims under Article 442 (1) § 1 of the Polish Civil Code, the period of limitation is three years from the date on which the injured party becomes aware of the damage and of the person obliged to remedy it; however, the period cannot be longer than ten years from the date on which the said event causing the damage took place. The term “enforceable” means that a claim right or agreement is of a type and in a form enforced by Polish courts. It does not mean that an obligation will be enforced in accordance with its terms in every circumstance in Poland. In particular, specific performance may not always be available as a remedy due to other legal implications such as force majeure, circumvention of law, abuse in the exercise of rights or misrepresentation. In general terms, any guarantee granted under Polish law must guarantee or secure another obligation to which it is ancillary and such primary obligation must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement. Furthermore, a Polish law guarantee and security interests become null if the primary obligation is null and terminate upon termination of the primary obligation. Moreover, an act in law performed by the original debtor with its creditor after issuance of the guarantee cannot increase the obligation of the guarantor without its consent. 196 ----- If a guarantee is given by the Polish Guarantors under Polish law and it relates to future debts, then from the perspective of the Civil Code the maximum amount of guaranteed debt should be specified in the guarantee document. The guarantee unlimited in time for a future debt may be revoked by the guarantor at any time before the debt arises. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Polish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable. _Limitations Resulting from the Polish Commercial Code_ The liabilities assumed by the Polish Guarantor under the Notes Guarantees by the Polish Guarantor is also subject to certain provisions of the Polish Commercial Companies Code. With respect to the limited liability company (spółka z ograniczona˛ odpowiedzialnos´cia˛, sp. z o.o.) and the joint-stock company (spółka akcyjna, _S.A.) pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the creation of a limited right in rem over the_ enterprise or over its organized part requires a resolution of the shareholders under the pain of invalidity. Pursuant to Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the shareholders may not receive, under any title, any payments from the Polish limited liability company’s assets needed to fully cover the share capital of this company. A breach of this rule results in the shareholders’ obligation to return the payments up to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, the liability of any Polish Guarantor on account of payments under the Notes Guarantees and Collateral should be limited, in particular, to the extent that it would result in a reduction of its assets necessary to cover in full its share capital in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code. Pursuant Article 344 § 1 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, it is not permissible to return to a direct shareholder(s) the share contributions (wpłaty na akcje) unless permitted otherwise. In case of the joint-stock companies, the Article 345 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code that regulates the restrictions concerning financial assistance should be observed. _Interests Limitation_ Pursuant to Article 359 § 2[1] in conjunction with § 2 of the Polish Civil Code, the maximum interest resulting from the legal act, meaning, so-called “capital interest” (odsetki kapitałowe) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest (meaning, double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 3.5 percentage points). As of the date of this memorandum, the maximum capital interest amounts to 7.2%. In addition, according to the Article 481 § 2[1] in conjunction with § 2 of the Polish Civil Code, the maximum interest resulting from a delay (odsetki za opóz´nienie) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest for delay (meaning, double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 5.5 percentage points). As of the date of this memorandum, the maximum interest for delay amounts to 11.2%. Should the value of interest exceed the value of relevant maximum interest, then relevant maximum interest is due. Contractual provisions cannot exclude or limit the provisions on maximum interest. The above mentioned specific provision of Polish law shall be applied by a Polish court irrespective of the fact that the parties have chosen foreign law to govern the transaction (overriding mandatory provisions).",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,266,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES,266.6,Canada,266.6.1,,"Certain of the Guarantors are formed or constituted under the laws of the Provinces of Ontario (Canada). This summary highlights certain aspects of (i) the laws of the Province of Ontario relating to guarantees granted by corporations and limited partnerships and (ii) the federal and provincial laws in effect in Canada in respect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, restructuring and receiverships in respect of the business and assets of debtors, in each case in force on the date of this offering memorandum. _Guarantees_ Under the laws of the Province of Ontario (and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein), there are no financial assistance rules that would restrict the giving of upstream guarantees by corporations or limited 197 ----- partnerships. Under the laws of the Province of Ontario (and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein), a guarantee or some of its provisions may be unenforceable against the guarantor if they constitute (i) a penalty or (ii) a breach of law or public policy (e.g., a clause providing for a rate of interest exceeding the statutory maximum under the Criminal Code (Canada) would be illegal). A guarantee may also be unenforceable if the underlying guaranteed obligation has been changed without the consent of the guarantor or is unenforceable against the principal debtor. This latter result may be avoided if the guarantee also includes appropriate language that causes it to be properly characterized as an indemnity in that an indemnity should remain enforceable notwithstanding any invalidity or defect in the underlying obligation unless it would be contrary to public policy to provide indemnification for the underlying obligation. However, there can be no assurance that an agreement characterized by the parties as an indemnity will not be recharacterized as a guarantee by the court. While a guarantee may also provide that a guarantor will be liable as principal debtor for any amount not recoverable on the basis of a guarantee, the enforceability or effect of such a clause is questionable and in certain circumstances such a clause may provide the guarantor with an additional defense to enforcement. Guarantees typically contain waivers of defenses available to the guarantor as a matter of law. Broad, non-specific waivers of any defenses that may be available to guarantors may be unenforceable if the court finds that they are too vague or uncertain or if they contravene mandatory provisions of law. The giving of a guarantee by a corporate entity may also be subject to a claim for the oppression remedy at corporate law. _Preferences and transfers at undervalue_ Guarantees and security granted in connection therewith may also be voided or deemed unenforceable on the basis that they constitute a “preference” or “transfer at undervale”. Further, if a court were to find that the issuance of a guarantee or security granted in connection therewith was a preference or transfer at undervalue, the court could void the payment obligations under such guarantee, and/or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such guarantee or pursuant to such security. In the event of a finding that a preference or transfer at undervalue occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. A guarantee or security given to a creditor dealing at arm’s length with the insolvent debtor could be voided on the basis that it constitutes a preference if the debtor issued the applicable guarantee or related security at a time when it was insolvent or was rendered insolvent, with a view to giving such creditor a preference (if such creditor is dealing at arm’s length with the party providing the guarantee or security) or which has the effect of giving that creditor a preference (if such creditor is not dealing at arm’s length with the party providing the guarantee or security). If the guarantee has the effect of bestowing a preference, intent will be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Also, a guarantee or security issued by a debtor may also be voided on the basis that it constitutes a transfer at undervalue if (1) the consideration received by the debtor in exchange for the guarantee was conspicuously less than the fair market value of the property so transferred; (2) the debtor was insolvent at the time when the guarantee was given or was rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the applicable guarantee, and (3) the debtor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor. If such guarantee is issued to a party not dealing at arm’s length with the insolvent debtor during the period that is one year prior to the initial insolvency event, the determination of whether (1) the insolvent debtor was insolvent at the time when the applicable guarantee was issued or was rendered insolvent by it, or whether (2) the insolvent debtor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor will not be relevant in the determination of whether or not the issuance of the applicable guarantee could be considered as a transfer at undervalue. In the context of insolvency proceedings, a trustee in bankruptcy, monitor or proposal trustee is or may be required to review asset transfers and transactions undertaken by the bankrupt or insolvent debtor within specified time periods prior to the commencement of such proceedings to determine if the debtor was engaged in any preferential transactions or transfers at undervalue. In certain circumstances, certain creditors can commence proceedings to declare reviewable transactions void. In the case of “transfers at under value”, the review period is one year (or up to five years for parties not dealing at arm’s length, depending on the circumstances, as set out in more detail in the paragraph below) whereas “preferences” are subject to review if they occurred within three months (or twelve months for parties not dealing at arm’s length). Provincial laws regarding fraudulent preferences, transfers at undervalue and fraudulent conveyances may also apply. We cannot be certain that the issuance of the guarantees would not be subordinated to any of the guarantors’ other debt or determined by a court to be void. _Insolvency_ In Canada, insolvency proceedings are governed principally by two federal statutes (with a third applying mainly to federal financial institutions). The federal insolvency laws in Canada apply across the country and allow for 198 ----- either a liquidation type proceeding (which is similar to a Chapter 7 type liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with some important differences) or a restructuring type proceeding (which is similar to a Chapter 11 type proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with some important differences). Notwithstanding that insolvency proceedings in Canada are generally governed by federal statute, in certain circumstances provincial and territorial laws will affect the conduct and/or outcome of those proceedings (e.g., security laws, landlord rights, receiverships, pensions, construction liens, etc.) and it is also possible to restructure an enterprise under the reorganization or arrangement provisions of applicable federal or provincial corporate statutes. The rights of the Trustee to enforce remedies could be delayed, impaired or otherwise restricted by the provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and other restructuring or arrangement legislation and orders made with respect to Canadian law if the benefit of such law is sought with respect to the Issuer or any guarantors. The powers of the court under the Canadian federal and provincial insolvency, reorganization or arrangement laws have been interpreted and exercised broadly and remedially so as to preserve enterprise value of a restructuring entity and protect such entity and its assets from actions taken by creditors and other parties. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the Notes or the Note Guarantee would be made during any bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, receivership or other restructuring proceedings, whether or when the Trustee could exercise its rights under the Note Guarantee or whether and to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the Trustee. _Liquidation_ Bankruptcy proceedings in Canada can be either voluntarily commenced by a debtor or commenced against the debtor by any creditor or creditors of such debtor where the unsecured claims of the applicant creditors equals C$1,000 or more. In order for a bankruptcy filing to be valid, the debtor must meet one of the tests for bankruptcy set out in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) (the “BIA”), with a common test being the inability or failure to meet obligations generally as they become due. Upon a bankruptcy occurring, all of the assets of the bankrupt (with a few limited exceptions) vest in a trustee in bankruptcy, with the proceedings being subject to the oversight of both the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the relevant court. Typically, a trustee in bankruptcy proceeds to liquidate the assets of the bankrupt and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with their legal priorities. The BIA and certain other federal and provincial statutes in Canada provide super priority or preferred status to certain claims. These super priority status claims may be secured on certain assets of the debtor and such security may rank in priority to the security interests of other secured creditors. After the claims subject to any statutory super priorities are paid, the BIA provides that secured creditors are to be paid prior to unsecured creditors. While the general rule is that unsecured creditors share any remaining proceeds pari passu, the BIA does provide that certain “preferred” claims are to be paid prior to the general body of unsecured creditors. Upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy order or a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy, the BIA imposes a stay of proceedings on unsecured creditors and leave is required to proceed, or continue, with any actions against the bankrupt entity. In a bankruptcy scenario, the stay of proceedings generally does not apply to secured creditors, such that secured creditors are free to continue to enforce their security against the assets of the bankrupt, subject to satisfying the trustee in bankruptcy that they have valid and perfected security over the same. As stated above, where applicable under federal or provincial law, a secured creditor may appoint a “receiver” or “receiver-manager” over the assets of a debtor or may seek court appointment of a receiver or receiver and manager. The receiver is not typically appointed to restructure a business. A receivership is typically intended as a mechanism for realizing on collateral through a liquidation or a going-concern sale. The receiver will proceed to sell the debtor’s assets, manage the debtor’s business or otherwise realize on the collateral, with the proceeds from its activities payable in accordance with the established priorities. A receiver can be court-appointed or, in most Canadian provinces, privately appointed—the advantages and disadvantages of each vary. In the case of a court-appointed receivership, the powers of the receiver are in the discretion of the court and set out in an appointment order. The appointment order typically also includes a stay of proceedings and super-priority security interests or charges (which could be in priority to the security of existing secured creditors) on the assets of the debtor to secure the payment of amounts owing in respect of the receiver’s fees and costs and, in certain circumstances, to secure the payment of any amounts to be borrowed by the receiver to facilitate the receivership. In the case of a private receiver, the receiver’s powers are prescribed by contract (i.e., between the creditor and the debtor) and subject to applicable laws governing the enforcement of security. 199 ----- _Restructuring_ Generally, restructuring proceedings of insolvent entities are commenced under one of two statutes in Canada and it is also possible to restructure an enterprise under the reorganization or arrangement provisions of the applicable federal or provincial corporate statute. Any such restructuring can involve a stay of proceedings with respect to creditors’ rights and remedies and a compromise of the debt, including secured debt, owing by the restructuring entity. For large or complex restructurings, the most commonly used statute is the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (the “CCAA”). In order to seek relief under the CCAA, the debtor must have at least C$5.0 million in outstanding claims against it or its corporate group. The granting of an order for relief under the CCAA is in the discretion of the court, but if granted, a CCAA order typically involves a broad stay of proceedings (applying to secured and unsecured creditors), protection from the termination of most contracts by third parties, authority to disclaim or repudiate unfavorable contracts (subject to certain exceptions) and, in certain cases, the granting of super-priority security interests or charges (which could be in priority to the security of existing secured creditors) on the assets of the applicant debtor company. Examples of these super-priority charges include those to secure the payment of any amounts to be borrowed from debtor-in-possession lenders to facilitate the restructuring, any amounts owing for the fees and costs of professionals involved in the restructuring and liabilities of directors of the company arising following the commencement of the CCAA proceedings. In addition, the court has broad statutory jurisdiction to grant any order it considers appropriate in the circumstances, subject to certain restrictions. An initial stay of proceedings under the CCAA cannot exceed 10 days, but the applicant debtor company is entitled to seek extensions of the stay thereafter. To obtain an extension, the applicant debtor company must satisfy the court that an extension is “appropriate”, and that the debtor has acted and is continuing to act in good faith and with due diligence. There is no time limit under the CCAA on the duration of an extension to the stay of proceedings under the CCAA or on the duration of the entirety of the proceeding itself. CCAA proceedings are supervised by the court and upon the making of an order under the CCAA, the court must appoint a licensed trustee in bankruptcy to act as the “monitor” of the applicant company. The monitor is given certain powers under the CCAA and additional powers may be granted by court order. The monitor does not take possession of, or have any control over, the assets of the applicant company unless otherwise ordered by the court. The monitor is required to oversee certain filings made or actions taken by the applicant company and provide its views with respect to same. The monitor also has a statutory duty to advise the court of any material adverse change in the status of the applicant company. Under the CCAA, a company may, inter alia, proceed to file a plan of compromise or arrangement and/or seek court approval of a sale of some or all of its assets. In the case of a plan of compromise or arrangement, it is necessary for the applicant company to obtain the requisite level of approval from affected creditors (approval must be obtained from creditors representing 66 2/3% in value of the debt and more than 50% in number of the creditors who cast votes in each affected class of creditors) and approval of the court. Secured creditors may be included in the plan, or may be dealt with outside of the plan. Upon requisite creditor and court approvals being obtained, the restructuring plan is binding on all affected creditors whether or not they voted in favor of the plan. CCAA plans may be combined with plans of reorganization or arrangement under Canada’s federal and provincial corporate statutes, allowing Canadian corporate entities to change their share capital, including cancelling existing shares and/or converting existing debt to new shares, in the context of a plan. If the proceeding includes an asset sale, any sale out of the ordinary course is subject to approval of the court (but with no creditor vote) and the court is authorized to make an order transferring assets to a purchaser free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances. During the course of a CCAA proceeding, creditors and contractual counterparties are not entitled to exercise any rights or remedies without leave of the court except for certain statutory exceptions (e.g., proven claims of set-off unless expressly restricted by the Court, termination and enforcement rights under certain types of eligible financial contracts and certain regulatory investigations). The court may not approve an asset sale or sanction a restructuring plan in the context of a CCAA proceeding unless certain statutorily prescribed claims are satisfied or provided for to the satisfaction of the court. Debtors in Canada may also proceed with a restructuring under the proposal provisions of the BIA. The proposal provisions of the BIA (the “Proposal Provisions”) provide for a process that is generally similar to, but less flexible than, restructuring proceedings under the CCAA. A restructuring under the BIA is typically undertaken where the proposed restructuring is small or relatively simple; or, where the applicant debtor simply does not qualify for the CCAA. There is no minimum amount of outstanding debt required to use the Proposal Provisions. 200 ----- Upon filing a proposal (or a notice of intention to make a proposal (“NOI”)) with the official receiver employed by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, the BIA provides for an automatic stay of proceedings. There is no need to apply to the court for the initial stay. The nature and term of the stay varies, depending on whether the debtor commences the proceedings by filing a proposal or by filing an NOI. Such stay will remain in place until the trustee administering the proposal proceedings is discharged (e.g., the proposal is implemented and the proceedings concluded) or the debtor becomes bankrupt (e.g., via a failed proposal, as discussed below). In the context of an NOI filing, the initial stay is for a period of 30 days and will apply to unsecured creditors as well as secured creditors subject to the caveats set forth below. However, if the debtor has not filed its proposal within the initial 30-day period, it may apply to the court for an extension of such period. The Proposal Provisions limit the duration of initial 30-day period and any extensions thereto to an aggregate of six months from the date of the filing of the notice of intention. Failure to file a proposal within this period will result in a deemed bankruptcy. The stay does not prevent a secured creditor from (i) dealing with the assets of the insolvent person if it took possession of the secured assets for the purpose of realization before the filing of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal and (ii) enforcing its security against all or substantially all of the debtor’s property used in relation to the debtor’s business if the secured creditor gave the required notice under the BIA more than ten days before the filing of the proposal or notice of intention to file a proposal or if the debtor consented to the enforcement by the secured creditor in accordance with the BIA. In the case of any proceedings under the Proposal Provisions, the applicant debtor is protected from the termination of most contracts by third parties. The Proposal Provisions also allow for the granting of super priority charges (similar to the CCAA), repudiation or disclaimer of contracts (similar to the CCAA), and the appointment of a proposal trustee (which may have a similar role and powers as a monitor under the CCAA). A proposal is ultimately put to a creditor vote, with secured creditors (if any) voting in a separate class (or classes) to the extent they are affected by the proposal. In the event that the debtor’s proposal to its creditors is either rejected by any class of unsecured creditors at a meeting held to approve such proposal (with the same voting thresholds as the CCAA noted above) or by the court when the proposal is put before the court for approval, the debtor is deemed bankrupt. Notably, if a proposal is rejected by a class of secured creditors but accepted by each class of unsecured creditors, the proposal does not automatically fail but may effectively frustrated. The secured class rejecting the proposal is left to pursue rights and remedies in respect of their security, while the proposal is submitted to the court for approval. The court may not approve an asset sale in the context of proposal proceedings or sanction a proposal unless certain statutorily prescribed claims are satisfied or provided for to the satisfaction of the court. In the event of a foreign insolvency proceeding, both the CCAA and the BIA allow a representative, authorized in a foreign proceeding in respect of a debtor, to seek recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding in Canada (which is similar to a Chapter 15 type proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with some important differences). The CCAA and the BIA each provide for a modified version of the UNCITRAL model insolvency law (collectively, the “Recognition Provisions”). The Recognition Provisions allow an authorized representative to apply for recognition of the foreign insolvency proceeding as either a “foreign main proceeding” or a “foreign non-main proceeding”. The determination of the type of proceeding is based upon the center of main interest (“COMI”) of the debtor. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign main proceeding”, the court must grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and also prohibit the debtor from selling or otherwise disposing of any of its property in Canada outside the ordinary course of its business without court approval, and may grant additional relief permitted under the CCAA/BIA, including the recognition of relief granted in the foreign jurisdiction which may differ materially from the relief normally available in Canada. If the court determines that the foreign proceeding is a “foreign non-main” proceeding, the court may, but is not required to, grant a stay of proceedings in Canada and prohibit the debtor from selling any of its property in Canada outside the ordinary course of business without court approval, and grant any other relief permitted under the CCAA/BIA, including the recognition of relief granted in the foreign jurisdiction which may differ materially from the relief normally available in Canada. In the event that the foreign proceeding results in the approval of a restructuring plan, the Canadian court may grant an order providing that such plan shall be recognized and have full force and effect in Canada. 201 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Each purchaser of the Securities (other than the Initial Purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to, warranted to and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers as follows: (1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction and that the Securities are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto and, in each case, in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below; (2) The purchaser is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or any Guarantor, is not acting on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor and is either: (a) a qualified institutional buyer, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and is aware that any sale of these Securities to them will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for their own account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer; or (b) a U.S. person (and is not purchasing the Securities for the account or benefit of a U.S. person) and is purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act; (3) The purchaser acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any of the Securities, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers; (4) The purchaser is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case, for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Securities to a qualified institutional buyer pursuant to Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the Securities Act; 202 ----- (5) The purchaser understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Securities or any beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so prior to the date which is, in the case of Securities offered to qualified institutional buyers, one year after the later of the original issue date of such Securities, the original issue date of the issuance of any additional securities and the last date on which the Issuer or any affiliate of the Issuer was the owner of such Security (or any predecessor of such Security) and, in the case of Securities offered to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S, 40 days after the later of the original issue date of such Security and the date on which such Security (or any predecessor of such Security) was first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S only (i) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiary thereof, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Securities are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur in offshore transactions outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the Security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date; (6) Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect: THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION.

If the purchaser purchases Securities, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Securities as well as to holders of these Securities. (7) The purchaser agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Securities; (8) The purchaser acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or transfer any Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with; (9) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of its acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Securities is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Securities as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account; and (10) The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Securities or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Securities in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Securities will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.” (11) The purchaser acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the Notes (including the Notes Guarantees) is no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If the purchaser is acquiring any Notes (including the Notes Guarantees) as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, the purchaser represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor account. 204 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of them. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Notes are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates, including in respect of sales into the United States. To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. Persons who purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out of pocket expenses. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that, if an Initial Purchaser defaults, the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or, in some cases, the Offering may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer and the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date falling 30 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of 205 ----- (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Notice to Certain _Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions.”_ Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes and Notes Guarantees in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes and Notes Guarantees in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Issuer will apply, through their Listing Agent, for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange; however, the Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be obtained or, if obtained, maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating the _Notes—Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_ The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In 206 ----- addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes— _Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”_ These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of issuance of the Notes and 45 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6 1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be business days following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade such Notes on the date of this offering memorandum or the next succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, are currently providing, or may in the future provide, investment banking, financial advisory, commercial banking, various lending, hedging, guarantee or other banking or budgeting services to us and our affiliates under bilateral agreements or local facilities in the ordinary course of business, for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates are mandated lead arrangers and lenders under the Senior Term Facilities and will receive customary fees in such capacities. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will act as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Senior Term Facilities Agreement. The proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Facilities and accordingly certain of the Initial Purchasers or certain of their respective affiliates will receive a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Notes. See “Use of Proceeds.” In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its affiliates, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge, and certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/ or its affiliates consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and short positions in such securities and instruments. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also act as counterparties in hedging arrangements. 207 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.2,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES England and Wales,25.2.1,,"The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or directly enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law at the time when proceedings were initiated (it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law); - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except with the agreement of the relevant parties or the relevant parties’ subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the US court; - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the terms of the United Kingdom Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits or being for a debt for a definitive sum of money or a sum of money ascertainable by arithmetical calculation ; - the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or English law including the United Kingdom Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment being for a definitive sum of money but not for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law, or other public law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (or based on a claim in contribution in respect of the same); - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a judgment of the U.S. federal or state courts, such judgment would be enforceable by the methods generally available for the enforcement of judgments in England and Wales. These give an English court a discretion whether to allow enforcement by any particular method. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will necessarily be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. Further, no steps (other than protective measures against the property of the judgment debtor) may be taken to execute a foreign judgment registered in England and Wales before the end of the period prescribed for the making of an appeal against enforcement in England and Wales of that 208 ----- judgment or pending the outcome of any such appeal if the time for lodging such an appeal has not expired, if any appeal is pending or anticipated against the English judgment in England or against the foreign judgment in the U.S. federal or state court. Moreover, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if there is a delay in seeking execution of the judgment, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.3,Germany,25.3.1,,"Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist: - if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not have jurisdiction; - if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly; - if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; - if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment; - if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature. 209 ----- German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents must be produced in court by the claimant: - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law; - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law; and - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has been notified to the defendant. However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, and notably if: - the rights of defense have been violated; - such recognition or enforcement would be incompatible with Belgian public policy; - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets without any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state; - the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement could then be granted) or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable laws; - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian private international law; - the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter; - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium; - Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

Therfore, any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in the United States in a civil matter would be recognized and enforced in the courts of Poland in accordance with the Polish Civil Procedure Code. As a general rule of the Polish Civil Procedure Code, judgments of foreign courts in civil matters are recognized by virtue of law, however, a judgment cannot be recognized in Poland if: (1) it is not final and binding in the state where it was issued; (2) it was issued in a case which belongs to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Polish courts; (3) a defendant, who has not argue the merits of the case, has not been duly and timely served with the complaint initiating the proceedings and consequently has been unable to defend themselves; (4) the party was deprived of the possibility of defending itself in judicial proceedings; (5) an action concerning the same claim between the same parties had been brought before a court in Poland before it was brought before a court of a foreign state; (6) it contradicts an earlier final and binding judgment of a Polish court or an earlier final and binding judgment of a foreign court satisfying the conditions for its recognition in Poland, which was rendered in a case concerning the same claim between the same parties; or (7) its recognition would contradict the fundamental principles of the legal order of Poland (the public order clause).

As a result, a Canadian court will not automatically recognize a final judgment for payment rendered by a federal or state court in the United States (a “U.S. Court”) based on civil liability (a “U.S. Judgment”) nor can a U.S. Judgment automatically be enforced against exigible assets of the parents or guarantors located in Canada. Further, Canada is a federation with a constitutional divisions of powers between the federal Government of Canada and its provinces and territories. Matters relating to property and civil rights fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of each of the provinces of 211 ----- Canada. Accordingly, in order to enforce a U.S. Judgment in Canada, a judgment creditor would be required to commence legal proceedings before a court of competent jurisdiction in the relevant jurisdiction of Canada (depending on the location of the judgment debtor and its assets). Courts of competent jurisdiction in the Province of Ontario (an “Ontario Court”) and the Province of Québec (a “Québec Court”) will permit an action to be brought on any final, conclusive, subsisting and enforceable judgment in personam for an unsatisfied sum certain rendered by any U.S. Court and will do so without reconsideration of the merits of the case before the U.S. Court, so long as: - the U.S. Judgment is not impeachable as void or voidable under the laws of the applicable federal or state or other applicable laws; - the U.S. Court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the judgment debtor, as recognized by an Ontario Court or a Québec Court for the purposes of enforcement of foreign judgments; - the same dispute is not before the Ontario Court or the Québec Court or has been the subject of a final decision of the Ontario Court, the Québec Court or the courts in another jurisdiction; - the U.S. Judgment was not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice or in contravention of the fundamental principles of procedure and the decision and enforcement thereof would not be inconsistent with public policy; - the U.S. Judgment is not manifestly inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations, as such term is applied by a Quebec Court; - the enforcement of the U.S. Judgment does not constitute, directly or indirectly, the enforcement of foreign revenue, penal, or expropriatory laws, other public laws, or laws relating to the imposition of taxes or similar charges (except in Québec, obligations resulting from taxation laws of foreign jurisdictions may be recognized if there is reciprocity); - the action to enforce the U.S. Judgment is commenced within the applicable limitation period and the judgment meets the necessary conditions for recognition under the laws of the Province of Ontario or the Province of Québec; - an Ontario Court or a Québec Court is satisfied that the judgment debtor has been properly served in the action to enforce such judgment; - in Ontario, if the U.S. Judgment is a default judgment, the judgment does not contain a manifest error on its face; and - the enforcement of the U.S. Judgment would not be contrary to any order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or the Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in respect of certain judgments, laws and directives having effects on competition in Canada. Furthermore, the enforcement of a U.S. Judgment in Canada may be affected by the bankruptcy or insolvency of a Canadian parent or Canadian guarantor (or other Canadian judgment debtor) and by Canadian bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, arrangement, winding-up proceedings or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights in general or general principles of equity. Under the Currency Act (Canada), a Canadian court (including an Ontario Court or a Québec Court) may only render judgment for a sum of money in Canadian currency, and in enforcing a foreign judgment for a sum of money in a foreign currency, both an Ontario Court and a Québec Court will render its decision in the Canadian currency equivalent of such foreign currency. Furthermore, interest after judgment may be limited to a rate of interest less that the rate specified in the documents on which the judgment is based. Both an Ontario Court and a Québec Court would apply their own respective provincial laws with respect to its procedures and matters that have overriding effect in the enforcement of a judgment of a U.S. Court. If a U.S. Judgment is subject to appeal, or if there is another subsisting judgment in another jurisdiction relating to the same cause of action, then either an Ontario Court or a Québec Court may stay an action to enforce the U.S. judgment. Courts in Ontario and Québec both have the discretion to require a foreign plaintiff to post security for costs in connection with an action to recognize and enforce a judgment of a U.S. Court. Further, both an Ontario Court and a Québec Court have the discretion to decline to exercise their respective territorial competence on the 212 ----- ground that a court of another state or province is a more appropriate forum to hear the action. Either an Ontario Court or a Québec Court, however, also retains the discretion to hear the enforcement action despite lacking territorial competence if there is no other court in which the plaintiff can commence the action or reasonably seek relief.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the UK Bribery Act, UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to component teams; and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to fraudulent journal entries (for example journal entries to increase profit) and bias in relation to judgements and estimates, particularly in the areas of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets impairment assessment; warranty provisioning; customer settlements; retirement benefit obligations; and restructuring provisioning. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included: – understanding and evaluating the key elements of the group’s internal control related to estimates; – validating the support behind the assumptions and judgements made by management including challenging against possible alternatives, for example in relation to goodwill, tangible and intangible asset impairment assessment and retirement benefit obligations; – identifying and substantively testing higher risk journal entries, in particular any that increased profit, that had unusual account combinations or were posted by senior management; – having discussions with and corroborating key assertions made by finance management with internal audit, the group’s legal counsel and senior group and divisional management including views on accounting judgements and estimates, and considering known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud; – reading the minutes of the Board meetings to identify any inconsistencies with other information provided by management; – reviewing internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements; – reviewing legal expense accounts to identify significant legal spend which may be indicative of serious breaches of laws and regulations; and – reviewing component teams’ key working papers for all in-scope components with a particular focus on the areas involving judgement and estimates. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. Impact of COVID-19 is a new key audit matter this year. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year. ----- Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Goodwill, tangible and intangible assets impairment We assessed management’s impairment analyses and focused assessment (group) our audit on challenging the key judgements and estimates.

Based on this work, we consider that the impairment loss recorded in the year and carrying value of goodwill are materially correct and we believe that the disclosures in the financial statements are appropriate. ----- Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Warranty provisioning (group) We focused on the judgements and estimates made by Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 80, management in assessing the likelihood and quantification of Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and material exposures and also on testing the completeness of Note 30 (Provisions). The group is exposed to warranty claims matters management have considered for requiring a provision. in the event that products fail to perform in accordance with Our procedures, at a group, divisional and component level, were previously agreed specifications. Warranty provisions are designed to assess appropriateness of the warranty provision established to cover potential exposures which arise from and included: this situation.

Due to this, there is a range of possible outcomes correspondence with the counterparty, where applicable; on warranty matters. – discussions with senior group and divisional executives, including members of the quality teams and personnel involved in the negotiation of the specific issues, reviewing internal management reporting and making enquiries to assess whether all material open issues have been assessed for provisioning purposes; – discussions with executive management to understand the status of negotiations on the specific issues; – challenging management by evaluating alternative scenarios to assess the impact of a range of possible outcomes and the impact of these outcomes on the provision; and – evaluating historical settlements against the initial provisions to assess management’s ability to make accurate estimates. Based on the work performed and our evaluation of the range of possible outcomes on each matter individually and in aggregate we believe the warranty provision is materially correct. Deferred tax asset recognition (DTA) and provisioning In conjunction with our tax specialists, we evaluated and challenged for uncertain tax positions (UTPs) (group) management’s judgements and estimates in respect of tax Refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 80, exposures to assess the appropriateness of the group’s UTP Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and provisioning and the recognition of DTAs.

Assessing the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the financial statements with respect to DTA and UTPs. Based on the evidence obtained we consider that the UTPs and DTA are materially correct and that the related disclosures are appropriate. ----- Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Impact of COVID-19 (group and company) We do not consider COVID-19 to present an audit risk in itself. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the group. Notwithstanding this, we have considered the impact of COVID-19 Global light vehicle production volumes have seen a sharp on the financial statements and designed and performed decline since 2019 and are expected to take several years procedures to address heightened risks on the financial statements. to recover. The resulting impact on the group’s results and outlook for the future has caused us to alter the nature The key audit matter titled Goodwill, tangible and intangible assets and extent of our procedures, particularly in the areas of impairment assessment sets out the impact of COVID-19 on the impairment assessment and restructuring provisioning. group’s impairment assessment and our procedures. Please see the key audit matters on goodwill, tangible and intangible impairment assessment above. With regards to restructuring provisioning for the group, our procedures included: With regards to the restructuring activities, there is a level – assessing the timing of implementation of the restructuring of judgement and estimation involved in assessing if there initiatives by reviewing Board approvals and inspecting is a constructive obligation to recognise a provision for these communications with employees affected by these restructuring activities, especially those initiated towards the restructuring programmes; year end. – verifying supporting documentation including employees payroll records and invoices for costs incurred to test whether the costs As is the case with many other organisations management’s are valid restructuring costs; and way of working, including the operation of controls, has – assessing the completeness of restructuring provision by been impacted by COVID-19 as a result of a large number of comparing the restructuring activities for which a provision is staff working remotely. There is inevitably an increase in risk made to the restructuring activities approved by management. due to the remote accessing of IT systems and potentially heightened cyber risk. With regards to the impact of COVID-19 on our audit process, we have interacted with group, divisional and local company Due to travel restrictions and safety concerns, members of management remotely throughout. Remote working has allowed the group audit team did not physically visit any component. us to have frequent contact with a wide group of management across the group. We increased the oversight of our component teams using video conferencing and remote workpaper reviews to satisfy ourselves as to the sufficiency of audit work performed by the component audit teams. Our audit places limited reliance on the group’s IT and control environment. However, in response to any incremental risk from remote working, we understood key changes to the group’s IT controls and processes as part of our assessment of audit risks. We also met with senior management responsible for cyber security and considered whether there were developments in the year that warranted further procedures. Based on the work performed, we consider that the incremental risk posed by COVID-19 has been mitigated to an accepted level. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,29,WHERE YOU CAN FIND OTHER INFORMATION,29.20,How we tailored the audit scope,29.20.1,,"Our approach to scoping was designed to achieve adequate coverage across the consolidated financial statement line items whilst addressing any location specific risks of material misstatement. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate. The group operates two divisions of Fluid Carrying Systems (FCS) and Fluid Tank Delivery Systems (FTDS) across four geographical territories of Europe and Africa, North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Each division consists of a large number of components spread across a number of countries. Overall, the group has 180 reporting components across 28 countries. We did not identify any individually significant components within the group. We have performed full scope audits on the financial information of 17 components (2019: 18 components) and targeted specified procedures based on risk and materiality on the financial information of nine components (2019: eight components). This is supplemented by analytical procedures on the remaining components that are not in scope. The group audit team in the UK performed audit procedures on the consolidation and accounting areas that are centralised, including goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, specific aspects of warranty provisioning and customer settlements, corporate taxation, defined benefit pension obligations, refinancing transactions and treasury balances and transactions. This scope of work provided coverage of 76% (2019: 74%) of revenue, 77% (2019: 72%) of operating result and 76% (2019: 74%) of net assets. The coverage for both the current and prior year is sufficient and in compliance with the applicable auditing standards. Our audit involves full scope audits of components in Belgium, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Korea, Poland, Spain, Turkey and targeted specified procedures for the components in India, Mexico and the U.S.A. Our specified procedures for components in Mexico and the U.S.A covered all material balances. We selected a component in India to perform targeted specified procedures around inventory in response to a matter that we were informed of by internal audit. We issued formal written instructions to all component auditors setting out the audit work to be performed by each of them and maintained regular communication with the component auditors throughout the audit cycle. Certain component teams have been able to visit the locations in person where it has been safe to do so. Others have adopted a hybrid model of working; visiting TI’s sites for some but not all activities. Due to the travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19, we modified the way we interacted with the component audit and local finance teams. Our interaction with component audit and local finance team’s included attending clearance meetings for all components and holding regular video conferencing calls with component audit teams, as well as reviewing and assessing any matters reported. The group engagement team also reviewed selected audit working papers for all components with a particular focus on their significant risks. The group audit team has performed the audit of the parent company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,29,WHERE YOU CAN FIND OTHER INFORMATION,29.21,Materiality,29.21.1,,"The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows Financial statements – group Financial statements – company Overall materiality €7.9 million (2019: €9.0 million) €8.7 million (2019: €8.5 million) How we determined it 5% of a three year average of profit before tax, 1% of net assets adjusted for exceptional items Rationale for benchmark applied Profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items is a generally accepted auditing benchmark for profit orientated businesses. Adjusting for exceptional items provides a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality. For the current year audit, we have adjusted our approach to the calculation to take account of the short-term effects of the pandemic on the current year results. In doing so we have applied the group’s three year average profit before tax as a basis to determine our 2020 materiality as opposed to the ‘in year’ profit before tax. We have taken this judgement noting that the results for the current year are likely to be a shortterm downturn in trading due to COVID-19 and not a permanent rebasing in the profitability of the business. As there is no trading activity within the parent company, net assets were considered an appropriate benchmark. For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between €700,000 and €5,581,500. Our procedures for the component in India did not require the application of materiality. We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to €5.9 million for the Group Financial Statements and €6.5 million for the Company Financial Statements. ----- In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors – the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls – and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate. We agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above €0.4 million (group audit) (2019: €0.45 million) and €0.4 million (company audit) (2019: €0.43 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Basis of Preparation,29.51.1,,"These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (‘IFRS‘) and the applicable legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006. In addition to complying with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, the consolidated financial statements also comply with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the fair valuation of assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies acquired, and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (‘FVTPL‘) (including derivative instruments not in hedged relationships). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management‘s reasonable knowledge, actual results may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are critical to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1.4. 1.1.1. Going Concern The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its consolidated financial statements. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Further information on the Group’s borrowings is given in Note 27. Further details of the Going Concern and Viability statements are disclosed in the Compliance statements. See page 62. 1.1.2. Functional and Presentation Currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group‘s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates (the ‘functional currency‘). The functional currency of each Group company has been assessed against the underlying transactions and economic conditions in which it operates. These financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Group‘s presentation currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise. 1.1.3. Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures Changes in accounting policies and disclosures are set out below: _1.1.3.1.

IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts‘[3] IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 for all entities that issue contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. 1 Effective for the Group‘s 2021 Financial Statements 2 Effective for the Group‘s 2022 Financial Statements 3 Effective for the Group‘s 2023 Financial Statements The new and revised standards disclosed above are not expected to have a material impact on the Group. There are no other standards or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that an investment in an associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment, which is recognised in the Income Statement, as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value. _1.4.2.2 Deferred tax assets_ Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global automotive production volumes in the period have been significantly impacted and caused trading losses. Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves the exercise of management‘s judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax assets are recognised. Management have looked at short and medium-term production volume forecasts to assess the trading profits to support recognition of the assets. The forecasts used are the same as those used in the impairment test noted in 1.4.2.1 above. Depreciation of PP&E is calculated using the straight-line method, reflecting expected patterns of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, to allocate their cost less residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: – Freehold buildings 30-50 years – Leased buildings improvements 30-50 years or the period of the lease if shorter – Plant, machinery and equipment 3-20 years Depreciation is not charged on assets in the course of construction. Once completed these are transferred to the relevant category above and depreciated accordingly. Enhancement expenditure of PP&E items is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of replaced parts is de-recognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals of PP&E are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount, and are recognised net within other income in the Income Statement. Investment grants received against the cost of acquired PP&E assets are included in payables as deferred income and credited to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the relevant assets. Borrowings, including extensions to existing agreements, are recognised initially at fair value, net of discounts and transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Interest arising on financial instruments is recognised on an accruals basis. In assessing whether a debt alteration is to be treated as a modification or an extinguishment and new arrangement, an evaluation is made of the qualitative factors such as the underlying parties to the transaction and quantitative factors such as the impact on the net present value of remaining cash flows. A gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement at the date of the extinguishment of a financial liability. _Financial liabilities at FVTPL_ A financial liability is classified in this category if it does not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial liability at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. The Group enters into conventional derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks, mostly foreign exchange forward contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 28. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into, and are subsequently marked to market by re-measuring to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are accounted for in accordance with the hedge accounting policy below. 1.10.3. Hedge Accounting The Group enters into derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each Balance Sheet date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. In March 2020, the Group terminated all its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash flow hedge relationships, its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in net investment hedges, and all its interest rate swaps. Prior to this date, the Group designated certain derivatives as either: – Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge); – Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). At the inception of a hedging transaction, the Group documented the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. The Group also documented its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that were used in hedging transactions were effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The Group‘s cost of hedging, the time value of options and forward element of forward contracts were initially recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to profit and loss over time. _Cash flow hedges_ The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and, prior to March 2020, variability in cash flows relating to US dollar borrowings. The Group also used interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk arising from its borrowings, which fixed the interest rate for a portion of the borrowings. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting were recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion was recognised immediately within finance income or expense in the Income Statement. When hedge accounting was discontinued for these cash flow hedges, the amount that had been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve was treated as follows: (i) if the hedged future cash flows for the US dollar borrowings were still expected to occur, that amount remained in the cash flow hedge reserve until the future interest or borrowings cash flows occur, or until that amount was a loss, and it was expected that all, or a portion of that loss, would not be recovered in one or more future period. In those circumstances, the amount that was not expected to be recovered was immediately transferred to finance income or expense in the Income Statement as a reclassification adjustment. (ii) if the hedged future cash flows for the US dollar borrowings were no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the cash flow hedge reserve was immediately transferred to finance income or expense in the Income Statement as a reclassification adjustment. _Net investment hedges_ Prior to March 2020, hedges of net investments in foreign operations were accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument, relating to the effective portion of the hedge, was recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion was recognised in the Income Statement. ----- Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The fair values of derivatives, which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, are classified as current assets or liabilities. Step 1:‑‑ To be recognised as a contract, there must be appropriate approval from both parties and clear identification of each party‘s rights under the agreement. The payment terms should be evident, with collection of consideration probable. The Group‘s customer arrangements take a variety of forms, with typical contractual frameworks comprising: master terms and conditions, programme award letters, purchase orders and release orders. For piece part revenue, volume requirements and mutually enforceable terms are established on the customer issuance of a release order and therefore this is the relevant accounting unit of contract. Tooling, prototype and development (‘TPD‘) requirements are typically specified in a purchase order or equivalent. Step 2: The performance obligation within a piece part release order is to manufacture and deliver the specified volume of requested parts. The performance obligation of a TPD order is to construct or undertake the relevant tooling and development activities. Where the different obligations are separable, in terms of both capability and within the contractual documentation, they are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Further details regarding the nature of goods and services sold is included in Note 2. Step 3: The fair value of consideration receivable is the transaction price specified in the relevant release order or purchase order, net of returns, discounts, sales taxes and volume rebates. For piece part revenue, the price is fixed at the given release order (contract) and does not include any element of variable consideration. For TPD revenue, where there is any uncertainty over the amount of consideration that will ultimately be recognised, the transaction price is constrained until such uncertainty is resolved. Amounts invoiced in excess of the transaction price will be reflected as pricing accruals or revenue deferrals. Step 4: The transaction price established in step 3 is allocated to the distinct performance obligations identified in step 2. Step 5: Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of the specified performance obligations, consistent with the passing of control of the goods and services. For piece part revenue, control is deemed to have passed at the point in time delivery of the parts specified in the applicable release order is made. Where consignment arrangements apply, revenue is only recognised when control of the underlying inventory has passed to the customer. For TPD activities, control is deemed to have passed once production part approval process (‘PPAP‘) or start of production (‘SOP‘) has been achieved, depending on the specific terms of the agreement. Costs incurred up until this point are recognised as work-in-progress on the Balance Sheet and reviewed regularly for impairment should their future recovery become doubtful. Upfront deposits and progress billings are recorded in deferred revenue, until point of recognition. Contract Costs Incremental costs incurred in obtaining a contract are capitalised and amortised over the applicable programme life, with regular review for impairment. Other pre-contract costs and costs of fulfilment are expensed as incurred unless future economic benefit is evident, or if applicable, within the scope of other standards.

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from, its involvement with the Group and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred to the former owners of the acquiree for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and any equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest‘s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree‘s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations‘. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. A list of subsidiaries and their countries of incorporation is presented in Note 4 of the Parent Company‘s financial statements. The term ‘Group‘ means the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and undertakings. 1.2.2. Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, under which the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor‘s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group‘s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition. The Group‘s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in Other Comprehensive Income is recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, both with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group‘s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements,29.56.1,,"The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates and for management to exercise judgement in applying the Group‘s accounting policies. Assumptions and accounting estimates are subject to regular review, governed by Group-wide policies and controls. Any revisions required to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the revisions are made including all future periods affected. The judgement and estimates that have the most significant and critical effect on the amounts included in the financial statements are post-employment obligations, impairments of assets, and recognition of deferred tax assets as described below. The Group has determined that the judgement as to whether the periods covered by an option to extend a lease are reasonably certain to be exercised, and whether options to terminate a lease are reasonably certain not be exercised, when assessing the lease term, are no longer considered to be critical. This follows successful adoption of the new lease accounting standard, IFRS 16, in the 2019 financial statements. 1.4.1. Critical Accounting Estimates _1.4.1.1 Post-employment obligations_ Costs and obligations of the Group‘s defined benefit plans are calculated on the basis of a range of assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary growth and mortality assumptions. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis illustrating how changes in the principal assumptions would impact the total defined benefit obligation, are included in the Retirement Benefit Obligations note. See Note 29.5. _1.4.1.2 Impairments of assets_ Following the COVID-19 pandemic, global automotive production volumes have been significantly impacted. Management considered this to be an indicator of impairment and accordingly performed full impairment tests as at 30 June 2020 and at 31 December 2020. Management have designated certain input assumptions to the Group impairment test as being critical estimates and have established volume forecast scenarios, from which operating cash flows over a five-year budget horizon were derived. As the scenarios were designed to cover all reasonably conceivable outcomes, the key source of estimation uncertainty in arriving at the forecast operating cash flows is deemed to be the allocation of scenario probabilities. The resulting CGU recoverable amounts, as calculated using the discounted cash flow model, are then in turn sensitive to the use of discount rates and long-term expected growth rates. Further discussion regarding how these critical estimates have been made and sensitivity analysis of CGU recoverable amounts to changes in these assumptions can be found in Note 18. 1.4.2 Critical Accounting Judgements _1.4.2.1 Impairments of assets_ As noted above, management performed a full impairment test as at 30 June 2020 and at 31 December 2020. They have applied judgement in establishing volume forecast scenarios, from which operating cash flows over a five-year budget horizon were derived. Further judgement has then been applied in assigning relative probabilities to these scenarios, such that weighted average operating cash flows could be calculated for use in the discounted cash flow model. Based on the outcome of the 31 December 2020 impairment test, judgement has been applied by management in establishing whether there is sufficient evidence of a significant and prolonged improvement in the forecast profitability of CGUs to support the reversal of any previously recognised impairment losses.

Goodwill,29.58.1,,"Initial measurement Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement. Subsequent measurement Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee. Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to impairment testing which is performed annually or when an impairment trigger event occurs. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value-in-use and fair value less costs of disposal. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group‘s cash-generating units (‘CGUs‘) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination which generated the goodwill. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. CGUs comprise the two operating segments each sub-divided into four geographic territories. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised where the costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the project and to use or sell the development asset. Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.

Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities,29.63.1,,"Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are created for all leases on the balance sheet, unless the lease term is short, or the underlying asset has a low value (‘exempt leases‘). Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Payments associated with exempt leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement. The Group first applied IFRS 16 ‘Leases‘ on 1 January 2019, in accordance with the simplified transition (modified retrospective) approach permitted in the standard, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognised on that date. All lease liabilities recognised on the balance sheet (‘non-exempt leases‘), were initially measured at the present value of their remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group‘s incremental borrowing rates as of 1 January 2019. All right-of-use assets existing at that date were initially measured at the amount of the lease liability after adjusting for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses. Since 1 January 2019, a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability has been recognised for all new non-exempt leases at the date at which the underlying leased assets are made available for use by the Group discounted using the Group‘s incremental borrowing rate at that date. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: – fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable – variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate – the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and – payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs, and restoration costs. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the Group‘s control. After initial recognition, lease interest payable is charged to the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset‘s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured when there is a change in the future lease payments due under a lease, due to a change in the lease term or fixed lease payments under the lease, including changes in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. A corresponding adjustment is also made to the right-of-use asset. Lease liabilities are remeasured at the Group‘s incremental borrowing rates at the date of the change, except where changes in lease payments result from a change in an index or a rate. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Financial Instruments,29.64.1,,"Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, other than financial assets and financial liabilities at ‘fair value through profit or loss‘ (‘FVTPL‘), are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are expensed as incurred. 1.10.1. Financial Assets Financial assets are classified into ‘financial assets at amortised cost‘ and ‘financial assets at FVTPL‘. The classification is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the Group‘s business model for managing the financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. _Financial assets at amortised cost_ Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/ (losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss. The Group‘s financial assets at amortised cost comprise ‘trade and other receivables excluding prepayments‘ and ‘cash and cash equivalents‘. _Financial assets at FVTPL_ A financial asset is classified in this category if it does not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial asset at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. These contracts are marked to market by re-measuring them to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement. _Offsetting financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet, when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group recognises expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument ‘lifetime ECL‘. A default on a financial asset occurs when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 180 days of when they fall due. The Group also assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the trade receivables. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL only when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument‘s external credit rating where available; significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread or the credit default swap prices for the debtor, indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in payments, an increase in the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy, or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 1.10.2. Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either ‘financial liabilities at amortised cost‘ or ‘financial liabilities at FVTPL‘. Financial liabilities are recognised initially on the date at which the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. _Financial liabilities at amortised cost_ The classification of financial liabilities at amortised cost is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the Group‘s business model for managing the financial liabilities and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Financial liabilities at amortised cost, including borrowings and trade and other payables excluding deferred income and lease liabilities, are measured using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and allocates interest expense over its term. The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments, (including all issuance discounts and transactions costs) through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Accrued paid absence such as holiday pay entitlement is charged to the Income Statement as earned. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under bonus plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount because of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Defined contribution plan Payments to a defined contribution retirement benefit plan are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group may elect to pay discretionary and fixed contributions to a separate trust and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts in respect of past service. Defined benefit plan A defined benefit plan provides an amount of benefit that an employee will receive at a later date, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, periods of service and compensation. Defined benefit arrangements in the Group include funded and unfunded pension plans, post-employment healthcare, statutory termination indemnities and long-service awards. The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (‘DBO‘) at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. Where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the DBO, an asset is recognised only to the extent of future economic benefits accruing to the Group either as cash refunds or as a reduction in contributions. The service cost of providing benefits for funded plans accruing during the year and any past service costs are charged as an operating expense. The interest cost or credit arising from the unwinding of the discount on the net actuarial liability or asset is recognised in the Income Statement as finance expense or income. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. The DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related benefit obligation. Defined benefit plans – funded The Group operates funded pension plans in the US, Canada and UK. The US plans are subject to annual actuarial review, whilst the others are formally valued at least triennially. Assets are held in trusts and are separately administered from the Group‘s activities. Assets include readily marketable equities, credit and diversified growth/multi-strategy funds, and qualifying insurance policies, and are valued at fair value. The Group makes contributions based on actuarial advice sufficient to meet the liabilities of the plans. Defined benefit plans – unfunded including healthcare The Group operates unfunded employment benefit plans in certain countries of which the most significant are post-employment healthcare in the US, a closed arrangement, and pension plans in Germany. Other liabilities include statutory termination indemnities and long-service awards. Share-based compensation The fair value of equity-settled payments to employees is determined at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes option-pricing models. The expense is recognised in the Income Statement on the straight-line basis over the period that the employees become entitled to the awards. The credit entry relating to the awards is recorded in equity (Note 7). The Group reviews the estimate of the number of shares expected to vest at each balance sheet date. The total amount expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, including any market performance and any non-vesting conditions, and excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.

Deferred tax Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities, where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The overall capital structure of the Group is designed to meet the strategic objectives of the Company and its shareholders.

Further details are available in Note 21. Cash, which is surplus to normal working capital needs, and any approved capital investments in the operating subsidiaries, is managed by Group Treasury.

The Group enters into derivative contracts, and incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. 3.3.1. Foreign Currency Risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on revenue, purchases, investments and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies of individual Group entities, which are primarily Euro, US dollars, Chinese renminbi and Korean won. Where possible, business entities sell in prices denominated in the same currency as the majority of their costs, to produce a natural hedge. At the reporting date, the majority of cash and cash equivalents in the Group were denominated in US dollars, Chinese renminbi and Euro. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage much of the residual transactional currency risk. In March 2020, the Group terminated all its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash flow hedge relationships, its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in net investment hedges, and all its interest rate swaps. Most of the instruments terminated in March had original maturity dates of October 2020. Due to the market fluctuations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group decided to crystallise these asset positions and convert them to cash. The Group realised cash proceeds of €15.9 million on termination of these derivatives and in total received €16.6 million in the year from these arrangements. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
505_2,Offerings 2021.md,29,WHERE YOU CAN FIND OTHER INFORMATION,29.103,3.** **Financial Risk Management continued,29.103.1,,"Derivative instruments used by the Group to manage foreign currency exposure fall under the following main categories: Forward foreign exchange contracts – not designated in hedge relationships The nominal value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2020 was €62.9 million (31 December 2019: €180.8 million) and the aggregate fair value was €0.2 million receivable (31 December 2019: €1.4 million receivable). Forward foreign exchange contracts – designated in cash flow hedge relationships In October 2015, the Group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts and US dollar interest rate swaps with a number of financial institutions. In aggregate, these instruments converted a portion of the drawings under the main borrowing facilities of $400.0 million at floating interest rates into €355.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.2%. These contracts hedge foreign exchange exposure on US dollar-based intra-group borrowings, in Euro functional-currency Group entities. The hedge ratio of this economic relationship was 1:1. In March 2020, the Group terminated all its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash flow hedge relationships. The average strike price in these contracts prior to termination was 1.16 US dollar to the Euro. The nominal value of the forward foreign exchange contracts in this arrangement as at 31 December 2020 was therefore €nil (31 December 2019: €564.7 million), and their aggregate fair value was also €nil (31 December 2019: €8.8 million receivable). A fair value gain of €27.3 million (31 December 2019: €33.9 million gain), was recorded in other comprehensive income in the year, and a €13.1 million gain (31 December 2019: €22.2 million gain) was subsequently recycled to the Income Statement. An ineffectiveness loss of €7.1 million (31 December 2019: €0.2 million loss) was recorded in the Income Statement (Note 11) of which €7.0 million was as a result of early termination of the contracts. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness principally arise from movements in the Company‘s and hedging counterparty‘s credit spread not reflected in the movements in the value of the hedged transactions, and from the unwind of the discounting inherent in off-market designations not at zero fair value at inception. Forward foreign exchange contracts – designated in net investment hedges In October 2015, the Group entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net investment in the Group‘s Korean won subsidiary. In March 2020, the Group terminated all its forward foreign exchange contracts designated in net investment hedges. The nominal value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2020 was therefore €nil (31 December 2019: KRW 265,893 million (€186.2 million); and their aggregate fair value was also €nil (31 December 2019: €17.0 million payable). A fair value gain of €6.9 million (31 December 2019: gain of €0.3 million) was recorded in other comprehensive income in the year for these contracts. No amounts were recycled during the year and there was no ineffectiveness. Sensitivity analysis The Group is primarily exposed to changes in Euro/US dollar exchange rates on its US dollar denominated intercompany borrowings. The Group‘s exposure to a change in other exchange rates is insignificant. The Group‘s exposure to a +/- 1% change in Euro/USD exchange rate would be a €1.4 million profit/€1.4million loss. Following termination of the Group‘s hedging instruments including those which manage interest rate risk, the Group is currently reviewing its hedging programme in the context of its external and intercompany borrowings in order to determine which of these instruments will be replaced. 3.3.2. Interest Rate Risk Most of the Group‘s interest rate risk arises on its main external borrowing facilities. On 30 September 2020, the Group successfully executed a refinancing of its external borrowings, see Note 27. Until 30 September 2020, the interest expense arising from the secured term loans, denominated in US dollars and Euro, were based on floating rates of respectively, one-month US dollar LIBOR (minimum 0.75%) +2.5% p.a. and three-month EURIBOR (minimum 0.75%) +2.75% p.a. From 30 September 2020, the interest expense arising from the secured term loans, denominated in US dollars and Euro is now based on floating rates of respectively, three-month US dollar LIBOR (minimum 0.75%) +3.75% p.a. and three-month EURIBOR (minimum 0.75%) +3.75% p.a. Until the refinancing on 30 September 2020, the Group also had an asset-backed loan facility which bore interest at US$ LIBOR +1.25% p.a. or US$ LIBOR +1.50% p.a. if drawings are over $50 million. This facility was terminated as part of the refinancing. The Group also has a revolving credit facility. The interest payable on this facility was increased from a range of US$ LIBOR +3.0% to US$ LIBOR + 3.5% p.a. (depending on leverage ratios) to a range of US$ LIBOR +3.0% to US$ LIBOR + 3.75% p.a. (depending on total net leverage ratio). The facility was increased by $100 million to $225 million on 30 September 2020 and was extended from 16 July 2023 to 16 July 2024. The facility is undrawn at 31 December 2020. Interest rate swaps As noted above, the Group has used interest rate swaps to manage the risk and used such contracts, together with the forward foreign exchange contracts to fix in €355.0 million of debt at 4.2%. In March 2020, the Group terminated all its interest rate swaps. The notional value of the interest rate swaps is therefore €nil at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: $400.0 million) and their fair value is also €nil (31 December 2019: €1.1 million receivable). In aggregate, a fair value loss of €2.3 million (31 December 2019: €3.2 million loss) has been recorded in other comprehensive income during the year and a €1.3 million loss (31 December 2019: €3.6 million gain) was subsequently recycled to the income statement. No ineffectiveness was recorded in the Income Statement. Interest rate floors In March 2020, the Group terminated all its interest rate floors. The aggregate fair value of these derivatives is therefore €nil at 31 December 2020 (31 December 2019: €1.3 million payable). -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Certain Executive Directors are entitled to bonus shares of up to 133% of their CSAs, subject to achieving an enhanced target in relation to the relevant performance condition. Award holders are entitled to a dividend equivalent payment, in respect of their awards, for all ordinary dividends that are declared and paid between the award date and the settlement date. These may be paid in cash at the date of vesting, or paid in the form of additional conditional awards, subject to the same conditions as the original grant. As the awards are settled in shares of the Company, or cash at the discretion of the Company, they are accounted for as equity settled awards under IFRS 2 and fair valued at date of grant using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (EPS and AFC tranches) and Monte Carlo simulation (TSR tranche). The fair value is recognised in the Income Statement straight line over the vesting period, with the anticipated number of awards vesting adjusted for management‘s estimate of forfeiture rate and attainment of non-marketbased performance conditions. Achievement of market-based performance conditions is reflected in the initial fair value of the award. The weighted average fair value of awards granted in the year was €1.68 comprising €1.47 for 2020 CSAs and €1.90 for 2020 RSUs (2019 CSAs: €1.89). The assumptions used for the grants in the year included a weighted average share price of €1.93 (2019: €2.22), expected option life of 3 years (2019: 3 years), expected volatility of 43.5% (2019: 37.6%) and a weighted average risk free interest rate of 0.02% (2019: 0.71%). Awards made to Executive Directors are subject to a two-year holding period post vesting, for which the valuations have been discounted accordingly. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company‘s share price since its admission to trading on 25 October 2017. The expected volatility of the comparator companies‘ share prices and correlation to TIFS is measured over a three-year period, commensurate with the expected term of the awards. The risk-free rate of return is based on zero-coupon UK government bond yields corresponding to the expected term. As award holders are entitled to dividend equivalent compensation during the vesting period, no dividend yield assumption is required in the valuation of these awards. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

For 2020, the Group is reporting an exceptional impairment charge of €304.6 million with a deferred tax benefit of €29.7 million which results in an exceptional effective tax rate of 9.8%.

As a result of the R&E study, TI US was able to report a material tax benefit in the 2019 accounts in the amount of €12.2 million net of the uncertain tax position associated with the tax credit. The R&E tax credit had a material favourable impact on the 2019 effective tax rate for the Group. For 2020, the Group is reporting an exceptional impairment charge of €304.6 million with a deferred tax benefit of €29.7 million. The majority of the impairment is related to goodwill that does not carry a deferred tax balance and therefore this portion of the impairment is not tax effected and results in a material unfavourable permanent tax adjustment. Factors that may affect future tax charges include the continued non-recognition of deferred tax assets in certain territories as well as the existence of tax losses in certain territories which could be available to offset future taxable income in certain territories and for which no deferred tax asset is currently recognised. 12.3.1.

The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included for valuation purposes in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Potential future cash outflows of €52.1 million (2019: €51.7 million) have not been included in the lease liability because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated). The lease terms for a number of leases were renegotiated during the year as a result of the COVID‐19 pandemic, to either reduce the rent on a temporary basis ‘rent forgiveness‘, or to reduce the rent on a temporary basis, and increase later payments, so that the total overall payments are unchanged ‘rent holidays‘. IFRS 16 has been revised to permit companies not to assess whether particular COVID-19-related rent concessions are lease modifications and, instead, account for those concessions as if they were not lease modifications.

The purchase of Millennium Industries Corporation on 16 February 2016 resulted in total goodwill recognition of €57.1 million and intangibles of €72.6 million, included in the FCS-NA CGU. The intangible assets recognised from acquisitions, as outlined above, included €369.7 million and €57.1 million in relation to customer platforms arising on the Bain and Millennium acquisitions respectively. These assets reflect the future revenue expected to arise from customer platforms existing at the date of acquisition, based on platform lives and probabilities of renewals. During H1 2020, forecasts for global automotive production volumes in the near and medium term were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, when compared to equivalent forecasts that underpinned the Group‘s 2019 annual impairment assessment, where no impairment was recognised. The scale of this volume deterioration, which was beyond what was reasonably estimable in early 2020, triggered the Group to perform a full impairment test as at 30 June 2020.

H1 2020 Impairment Test,267.1.1,,"The recoverable amount estimated in the H1 2020 impairment test for the CGUs was determined based on a value-in-use calculation. Due to the high level of uncertainty over future global automotive production volumes, management elected to use an ‘expected cash flow‘ approach, as described in IAS 36, to obtain their estimate of future operating cash flows for each of the CGUs. To determine the expected cash flows, the Group established four volume scenarios which covered the period from 30 June 2020 to 30 June 2025, with relative probabilities then assigned to the operating cash flows arising from these scenarios. Weighted average operating cash flows across the scenarios were then calculated for inclusion in the discounted cash flow model. To reflect the high level of uncertainty in future volume projections, the four scenarios demonstrated alternative profiles in terms of likely future volumes and the rate of market volume recovery. The base case scenario utilised May 2020 IHS global light vehicle production forecasts. These forecasts exhibited a significant reduction in 2020 production units versus 2019, with a subsequent recovery profile that returned volumes to 2019 levels in 2024, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.4%. The three additional scenarios reflected two downside volume profiles relative to the base scenario and one upside volume profile. These scenarios were prepared by reflecting factors such as historical external forecasting accuracy, geographical distributions of volume and different potential rates of market volume recovery, as demonstrated in the graph below.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Assumptions The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations were: – forecast operating cash flows – long-term expected growth rates – discount rates As outlined above, the forecast operating cash flows were established using the respective volume scenarios and the resultant forecast demand for our products given those volumes. Product mix, pricing assumptions, market outperformance and working capital management actions, which remain broadly consistent with those that underpinned the 2019 impairment review, were then applied to the forecast sales profiles. Refer to section 18.3 for the discount and growth rates used in both the H1 2020 and H2 2020 impairment models. Sensitivity analysis The H1 2020 impairment review necessitated that the CGU assets, within the scope of IAS 36, of FCS-LA and FTDS-LA, be fully impaired. Each scenario modelled resulted in operating cash outflows. The Latin American CGUs were therefore excluded from the following sensitivity analysis, as management did not believe reasonably possible changes in input assumptions would alter this result. Where the H1 impairment test resulted in an impairment, or where at H1 management believed a reasonably possible change in assumption would cause a future impairment, sensitivity testing was performed. The following table demonstrates the impact of changes in the H1 long-term expected growth rates and discount rates, in isolation, for CGUs deemed to be sensitive to such changes.

Assuming 100% probability weightings to each of the four H1 scenarios resulted in the following hypothetical impairments: No impairments were recorded in FCS-AP and FTDS-AP due to more resilient production volume forecasts in the Asia Pacific region. Applying a 100% weighting to the Downside 2 scenario still resulted in recoverable amounts in excess of CGU net assets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, management initiated a number of mitigating cost reduction schemes, including global restructuring programmes. Only savings from restructuring events that were appropriately authorised by management and communicated to the affected employees on or before 30 June 2020 were reflected in the H1 2020 forecast operating cash flows. The impact of restructuring activities undertaken subsequent to this date has been included in the H2 impairment test; see section 18.3 for further details. The below table outlines the respective probabilities assigned to each of these scenarios as well as the 2020 actual production volumes and 2021 forecast production volumes, with corresponding growths rates over this period. Assumptions The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are: – forecast operating cash flows – long-term expected growth rates – discount rates Forecast operating cash flows were established using the respective volume scenarios and the resultant forecast demand for our products given those volumes. Product mix, pricing assumptions, market outperformance and working capital management actions were then applied to the forecast sales profiles. Long-term expected growth rates and discount rates are determined with reference to the services of third-party valuation experts and utilise externally available sources of information, adjusted where relevant for industry specific factors. Long-term growth rates are based on long-term economic forecasts for growth in the automotive sector in the geographical regions in which the CGUs operate. Discount rates are calculated for each division using a weighted average cost of capital specific to the geographical regions from which the cash flows are derived.

H2 2020 Impairment Test,267.6.1,,"Due to continuing uncertainty over global automotive production volumes in the near and medium term, management performed an additional full impairment test as at 31 December 2020, to establish whether the recoverable amounts of CGU assets exceed their carrying values. During the second half of 2020, automotive production volumes have shown some signs of stabilising, with actual 2020 global light vehicle production of 74.6 million units compared with 68.3 million forecast in the H1 2020 base case scenario. As greater clarity emerges over the market response to the pandemic, management believe it is appropriate to reduce the number of scenarios used in the expected cash flow model to reflect a narrower range of plausible outcomes. Accordingly, two scenarios have been established utilising IHS global light vehicle production forecasts; a ‘base case‘ and a ‘downside‘. The base case scenario uses November 2020 IHS volume forecasts, adjusted for product mix, pricing assumptions and market outperformance to establish forecast sales values. Contribution margin, fixed cost, research and development expenditure, capital expenditure and working capital management estimates are then applied to arrive at the forecast operating cash flows for inclusion in the value-in-use discounted cash flow model. Cash flows resulting from restructuring activities not announced at the reporting date and cash flows that are contingent on enhanced capital expenditure are excluded from the forecasts. The downside scenario uses a more conservative volume forecast dataset issued by IHS and also incorporates risk adjustments where appropriate for potential programme losses, and longer-term impacts to consumer demand arising from technological evolution in response to climate change and evolving mobilisation trends. As outlined in Note 1, management have considered the potential impacts of climate change on the impairment assessment. This has included risk adjusting forecast cash flows to capture uncertainty regarding possible future changes to environmental regimes and their impact on existing automotive market trends, including the transition to full electrification. The below graph demonstrates the volume profile of these two scenarios across the five-year medium-term plan horizon.

This observed increase in recoverable amount when compared to the H1 2020 impairment test is a result of improved external automotive volume forecasts in combination with the execution of internal cost saving initiatives and restructuring activities. To the extent that such activities were appropriately authorised by management, and communicated to the affected employees on or before 31 December 2020, the associated cash savings have been reflected in management’s forecast of operating cash flows. Whilst impairments recorded against goodwill cannot be reversed in a subsequent reporting period, management are required to monitor external and internal sources of information for indicators that previously recognised impairment losses for intangible assets, PP&E and leased right-of-use assets may have decreased or no longer exist. This is applicable to FCS-LA, FTDS-LA, FTDS-NA and FTDS-EU, where asset impairments, other than goodwill, were recorded at H1 2020. Both Latin America CGUs were fully impaired at H1 2020, as a result of forecast negative cash flows. Although restructuring activities have been implemented during H2 2020 to mitigate these negative cash flows, uncertainty over the longer-term economic viability of operations in this region lead management to conclude that it is appropriate to maintain the impairment losses as at 31 December 2020. Despite positive headroom in FTDS-NA and FTDS-EU providing an indication that previously recognised impairment losses have decreased, management do not believe sufficient time has passed since recognising these impairment losses in H1 2020 to evidence a significant and prolonged improvement in the economic performance arising from the underlying CGU assets. Furthermore, as evidenced in the H2 2020 sensitivity analysis (below) reasonably possible changes to the estimates made in the H2 2020 impairment model may result in significant variations in resulting headroom over the short term, particularly where market interruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic persists. Management will therefore continue to monitor external and internal sources during 2021, and until such a time that indicators of a sustained improvement in future CGU cash generation can be demonstrated with sufficient confidence, before contemplating the reversal of impairment losses. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Based on the observed level of headroom in FCS-AP, FTDS-AP, FCS-NA and FCS-EU, management do not believe a reasonably possible change in assumptions would impact the carrying value of CGU assets. When applying a 100% probability weighting to the downside scenario, all four CGUs still demonstrate positive headroom. Furthermore, the H1 2020 impairments in FCS-NA and FCS‑EU were to goodwill only, which cannot be reversed in a subsequent reporting period. Both Latin America CGUs were fully impaired at H1 2020 due to forecast operating losses, and as described above, despite implementing restructuring initiatives during H2 of 2020, management believe the economic environment in this region will not be conducive to reducing the previously recognised impairment losses in the short to medium term.

Term loan The principal outstanding of the US term loan in US dollars at 31 December 2020 is $738.2 million (2019: $834.2 million). Following the Group‘s refinancing on 30 September 2020, the interest rate payable on the US term loan is three-month US dollar LIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +3.75% p.a. and on the Euro term loan is three-month EURIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +3.75% p.a. The US dollar term loan is repayable in amounts of $1.85 million per quarter until the balance falls due on 16 December 2024. Prior to the refinancing, capital payments were not due during the remaining lifetime of the loan, as they had been prepaid as part of a voluntary repayment made in a prior year. The Euro term loan is repayable in amounts of €1.25 million per quarter (€1.1 million per quarter before refinancing), with the balance also falling due on 16 December 2024. On 6 October 2015, the Group entered into hedging transactions with a number of financial institutions which effectively converted borrowings of $400.0 million at floating interest rates into €355.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.2%, thereby reducing foreign currency exposure for future cash flows and locking in lower long-term Euro fixed interest rates (Note 3.3.2). In March 2020, the Group terminated all these hedging instruments. Most of the instruments had original maturity dates of October 2020. Due to the market fluctuations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group decided to crystallise these asset positions and convert them to cash. Revolving Credit Facility and Asset-Backed Loan Prior to the Group‘s refinancing, the revolving credit agreement provided a facility of up to $125.0 million. Drawings under this facility bore interest in a range of US$ LIBOR +3.0% to US$ LIBOR + 3.5% p.a. depending on the Group‘s leverage ratios. On 27 March 2020, the Group drew down the full amount available under the facility. The amount was repaid in full on 29 July 2020. After the Group‘s refinancing on 30 September 2020, the facility‘s interest rate was increased to bear interest in a range of US$ LIBOR +3.0% to US$ LIBOR + 3.75% p.a. (depending on total net leverage ratio). The facility was also increased by $100.0 million to $225.0 million, was extended from 16 July 2023 to 16 July 2024, and became available to be used to issue letters of credit on behalf of TI Group Automotive Systems LLC, a subsidiary undertaking. The facility is undrawn at 31 December 2020 (except for letters of credit see below). The asset-backed loan (‘ABL‘) provided up to $100.0 million depending upon the level of inventories and trade receivables in the Group‘s US and Canadian businesses. The facility was also available to be used to issue letters of credit on behalf of TI Group Automotive Systems LLC, a subsidiary undertaking. Drawings under the facility bore interest at US$ LIBOR +1.50% p.a. unless the drawings were below $50.0 million when the rate was US$ LIBOR +1.25% p.a. On 27 March 2020, the Group drew down $25.0 million under the facility. The amount was repaid in full on 21 May 2020.

This facility bore interest at US$ LIBOR +1.25% p.a. or US$ LIBOR +1.50% p.a. if drawings are over $50.0 million. Unamortised transaction costs of $0.9 million (€0.8 million) were released on the extinguishment of this loan and recognised as finance expense.

Defined Benefit Arrangements,267.60.1,,"Pension plans The Group operates funded defined benefit pension plans in the US, Canada and the UK under broadly similar regulatory frameworks. All of the plans provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of pensions provided is determined by members‘ length of service and, for most of these plans, pensionable remuneration. Plan assets are held in trusts from which all benefit payments are made. The plans are governed by local regulations and practice, including the nature of the relationship between their trustees and the Group. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment strategy and schedules of contributions, rests primarily with the trustees, some of whom who are appointed by the Group and the remainder by the members in accordance with the rules of each plan. There are five plans in the US, all of which are closed to both new entrants and future accrual. The active members are not required to make contributions to the plans. Pensions in payment are not subject to inflationary increase. The plan in Canada remains open to new entrants, and is contributory. Pensions in payment are subject to discretionary inflationary increase. The UK plan is closed to new entrants but remains open to future accrual. Pensions in payment are subject to annual increase based on the UK Retail Price Index. Independent accounting valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out as at 31 December 2020. The US pension plans are subject to annual actuarial valuation, and were most recently valued by independent qualified actuaries as at 1 January 2020. The Canadian plan is subject to actuarial valuation at least triennially, and was most recently formally valued as at 31 December 2020 (final results to be published by Q4 2021 as per filing deadlines). The UK plan is subject to triennial actuarial valuation, and was most recently formally valued as at 6 April 2018. Employer funding contributions to the US and other funded pension plans are agreed at each formal valuation, and for the year ended 31 December 2020 totalled €7.8 million (2019: €5.0 million). Contributions for the 12 months ended 31 December 2021 are expected to amount to €4.5 million.

Pension Plans – Risk Analysis,267.87.1,,"Asset volatility Plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If plan assets were to underperform this yield, this would create a deficit. All the funded plans hold a proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, but which are also likely to experience greater price volatility and therefore risk in the short term. As plans mature, the Group‘s strategy is to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets whose risk profile is a better match for the liabilities. Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields has the effect of increasing plan liabilities, although this is partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans‘ bond holdings. Inflation risk The Group‘s pension obligations in Canada, the UK and Germany are inflation linked. Caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plans against above normal inflation. The US pension obligations are not inflation indexed. The majority of the plan assets are not directly inflation indexed, meaning that an increase in inflation will tend to increase the deficit. Life expectancy The majority of the plans‘ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of each retired member and his/her spouse, so increases in life expectancy result in an increase in the plans‘ liabilities. The investments of the funded plans are managed within an asset-liability matching framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that align with the obligations of the plans. One objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in annuities and long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due in the appropriate currency. The plans actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments match the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The processes used to manage the risks have not changed from previous years. Investments are diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A large portion of assets consist of bonds and equities, although the plans also hold investment funds and liability driven investments. Equities have been shown to offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Basis of Preparation,267.111.1,,"The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS‘) as adopted by the European Union, the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC‘) interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL‘). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management‘s reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. 1.1.1. Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its financial statements. The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. See Note 1.1.1 of the consolidated financial statements for further information. 1.1.2. Functional and Presentation Currency These financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company‘s functional currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise. 1.1.3. Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures There are no amendments to standards or new standards where adoption by the Company for the first time has had a material impact on the Company‘s financial statements for the current financial reporting year. A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, or are not yet effective because they have not yet been endorsed by the EU. These have not been applied in preparing the Company‘s financial statements and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. These are discussed further in the consolidated financial statements. There are no other standards or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Company. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union, the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the fair valuation of assets and liabilities of subsidiary companies acquired, and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (‘FVTPL’) (including derivative instruments not in hedged relationships). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s reasonable knowledge, actual results may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are critical to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 1.4. 1.1.1. Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its consolidated financial statements. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Further information on the Group’s borrowings is given in Note 25. 1.1.2. Functional and Presentation Currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The functional currency of each Group company has been assessed against the underlying transactions and economic conditions in which it operates. These financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Group’s presentation currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise. 1.1.3. Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures Changes in accounting policies and disclosures are set out below: _1.1.3.1. New and Revised IFRS Affecting Amounts Reported in the Current Year (and/or Prior Years)_ IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ The Group has applied IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ for the first time in these consolidated financial statements, from its mandatory adoption date of 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ replaces the existing guidance in IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and IFRIC ‘Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease’ and eliminates the dual accounting model for lessees. The standard removes the accounting distinction between finance and operating leases for lessees, and requires that right-of-use assets and liabilities be created for all leases on the balance sheet, unless the lease term is 12 months or less, or the underlying asset has a low value. Under the new standard, operating lease charges have been replaced with interest payable and depreciation charges. On an individual lease basis, this will result in higher expenses in the Income Statement earlier in the lease term, and correspondingly lower expenses later in the lease term. The Group has elected to apply IFRS 16 Leases in accordance with the simplified transition (modified retrospective) approach permitted in the standard. The new rules have been adopted in the current year only, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognised on 1 January 2019. The Group has not restated comparative amounts for the year ended 31 December 2018. The Group has elected to measure right-of-use assets at the amount of the lease liability on adoption, after adjusting for any prepaid or accrued lease expenses. On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as ‘operating leases’ under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rates as of 1 January 2019. From 1 January 2019, new or modified leases are discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate or the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined. For most leases, the implicit rate cannot be calculated, and the Group’s incremental borrowing rate has been used instead. ----- The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union, the UK Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRS IC’) interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing these financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. 1.1.1. Going Concern After making enquiries, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of approval of its financial statements. The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. 1.1.2. Functional and Presentation Currency These financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest 100,000 except where stated otherwise. 1.1.3. Changes in Accounting Policy and Disclosures There are no amendments to standards or new standards where adoption by the Company for the first time has had a material impact on the Company’s financial statements for the financial reporting year beginning 1 January 2019. A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020, or are not yet effective because they have not yet been endorsed by the EU. These have not been applied in preparing the Company’s financial statements. These are discussed further in the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Financial Instruments,267.114.1,,"Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, other than financial assets and financial liabilities at ‘fair value through profit or loss‘ (‘FVTPL‘) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are expensed as incurred. 1.4.1. Financial Assets Financial assets are classified into ‘financial assets at amortised cost‘ and ‘financial assets at FVTPL‘. The classification is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the Company‘s business model for managing the financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. _Financial assets at amortised cost_ Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss. The Company‘s financial assets at amortised cost comprise ‘loans due from related parties‘ and ‘cash and cash equivalents‘. _Financial assets at FVTPL_ A financial asset is classified in this category if it does not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial asset at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. For loans due from related parties, the Company recognises expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument ‘lifetime ECL‘. The Company also assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the loans due from related parties. For all other financial instruments, the Company recognises lifetime ECL only when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Company considers an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument‘s external credit rating where available; significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread or the credit default swap prices for the debtor, indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in payments, an increase in the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy, or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 1.4.2. Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either ‘financial liabilities at amortised cost‘ or ‘financial liabilities at FVTPL‘. Financial liabilities are recognised initially on the date at which the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. _Financial liabilities at amortised cost_ The classification of financial liabilities at amortised cost is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the Group‘s business model for managing the financial liabilities and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Liabilities at amortised cost, including ‘loans due to related parties‘ and trade and other payables, are measured using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and allocates interest expense over its term. The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments (including all fees, transaction costs and premiums) through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. _Financial liabilities at FVTPL_ A financial liability is classified in this category if it does not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial liability at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. ----- Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.

Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. _Assets at amortised cost_ Assets at amortised cost are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and where the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Company’s assets at amortised cost comprise ‘loans due from related parties’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Company recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost or at FVTPL.

The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income and equity. Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Deferred tax Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,267,FTDS,267.149,"Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud",267.149.1,,"Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the Listing Rules, the UK Corporate Governance Code, UK tax legislation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to component teams, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management’s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to fraudulent journal entries (for example journal entries to increase profit) and bias in relation to judgements and estimates, particularly in the area of warranty provisioning. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included: –– validating the support behind assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates including comparison against possible alternatives, for example in relation to retirement benefit obligations; –– identifying and substantively testing higher risk journal entries, in particular any that increased profit, that had unusual account combinations or were posted by senior management; –– discussions with internal audit, the Group’s legal counsel and senior Group and divisional management including views on accounting judgements and estimates, and consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud; –– reading the minutes of the Board meetings; –– review of internal audit reports in so far as they related to the financial statements; –– review of legal expense accounts to identify significant legal spend which may be indicative of serious breaches of laws and regulations; and –– review of component teams’ working papers in Belgium, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Turkey and USA with a particular focus on their significant matters. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The Group operates across four geographical territories of Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America and two divisions of Fluid Carrying Systems (FCS) and Fluid Tank Delivery Systems (FTDS). Each division consists of a large number of components spread across a number of countries. Overall, the Group operates in 108 locations across 28 countries. We did not identify any individually significant components within the Group. We scoped our work to ensure that overall we have sufficient coverage to express the required opinion in compliance with applicable Auditing Standards. We have revised the components in scope for a full scope audit to include components with specific risks. We have performed full scope audits on the financial information of 18 components (2018: 15 components) and specific audit procedures based on risk and materiality on the financial information of eight components (2018: eight components). This is supplemented by analytical procedures on the components that are not in scope. The Group audit team in the UK performed audit procedures on the consolidation and accounting areas that are centralised in the UK, including goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, corporate taxation, defined benefit pension obligations and treasury balances and transactions. The coverage for both the current and prior year is sufficient and is in compliance with the applicable auditing standards. Our audit involves full scope audits of components in Belgium, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Korea, India, Poland, Spain, Turkey and targeted specified procedures for the components in Mexico and the USA. We issued formal written instructions to all component auditors setting out the audit work to be performed by each of them and maintained regular communication with the component auditors throughout the audit cycle. These interactions included attending certain component clearance meetings and holding regular conference calls, as well as reviewing and assessing any matters reported. The Group engagement team also reviewed selected audit working papers for components in Belgium, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Turkey and the USA with a particular focus on their significant risks. In addition, senior members of the Group engagement team visited component teams in Belgium, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Poland and the USA.

Materiality was determined as 5% of profit before tax, adjusted for exceptional items at the planning stage based on forecast results. We reassessed our preliminary assessment of materiality in light of the Group’s actual results which did not result in a change. For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between €450,000 and €5,000,000. We agreed with the Audit & Risk Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above €450,000 (Group audit) (2018: €520,000) and €430,000 (Company audit) (2018: €450,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,267,FTDS,267.179,1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued,267.179.1,,"In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard: –– the application of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics –– reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous –– the exclusion of initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application, and –– the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. –– The Group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is a lease, or contains a lease at the date of initial application. For contracts entered into before the transition date, the Group has relied on its previous assessment made when applying IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’. The Group has also applied the expedient which allows payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets to be recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less, or those leases, which regardless of their original lease term, ended on or before 31 December 2019. Leases of low-value assets are leases whose underlying assets when new are valued at under €10,000. Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Lease interest payable is charged to the Income Statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: –– fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable –– variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate –– amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees –– the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and –– payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs, and restoration costs. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the Group’s control. Until the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group, as lessee, had substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership were classified as finance leases, see previous policy Note 1.9. The Group’s activities as a lessor are not significant and the adoption of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ has not had any impact on the consolidated financial statements from that activity. _Early adoption of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)_ The Group has elected to early adopt the ‘Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform’ issued in September 2019. In accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of the reporting period or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve at that date. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by Interbank offered rate (IBOR) reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in the Income Statement. Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which include the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present. The Group’s main borrowings comprise a US term loan and a Euro term Loan. The interest rate payable on the US term loan is US dollar LIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +2.5% p.a., and on the Euro term loan is EURIBOR (minimum 0.75% p.a.) +2.75% p.a. as further detailed in Note 25. As detailed in Note 3, the Group holds a series of forward foreign exchange contracts and US dollar interest rate swaps with a number of financial institutions which in aggregate converted a portion of the drawings under the main borrowing facilities of $400.0 million at floating interest rates into €355.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.2%. The Group does not have any hedging relationships directly affected by EURIBOR reform. The effect of early adoption of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reforms will therefore only impact the Group’s US dollar LIBOR instruments. ----- In summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments, that apply to the Group are: –– When considering the ‘highly probable’ requirement, the Group has assumed that the US dollar LIBOR interest rate on which the Group’s hedged debts are based does not change as a result of IBOR reform. It is currently expected that SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) will replace US dollar LIBOR. Differences between SOFR and US dollar LIBOR include that SOFR is a ‘term rate’, which means that it is published for a borrowing period (such as thee months), and is also ‘forward-looking’, because it is published at the beginning of the borrowing period. –– In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis, the Group has assumed that the US dollar LIBOR interest rate, on which the cash flows of the hedged debt and the interest rate swap that hedges it are based, is not altered by IBOR reform. –– The Group will not discontinue hedge accounting during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective effectiveness falls outside the required 80–125% range. –– The Group has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the reforms are expected to take effect. _1.1.3.2. New and Revised IFRS in Issue but not yet Effective_ A number of new standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020, or are not yet effective because they have not yet been endorsed by the EU. These have not been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Group has not applied the following new and revised standards that have been issued but are not yet effective or are not yet endorsed by the EU: Amendments to References to the Amendments to various standards references to the revised Conceptual Framework. Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards[1] Amendment to ‘IFRS 3 Business Various clarifications around what is considered a business. Combinations’[1] Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: ‘Definition Clarifies the definition of ‘material’ and aligns the definition used in the Conceptual of Material’[1] Framework and the standards. IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’[2] IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 for all entities that issue contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features.[2] 1 Effective for the Group’s 2020 financial statements. 2 Effective for the Group’s 2022 financial statements. There are no other standards or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. 1.2.2. Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, under which the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition. The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in Other Comprehensive Income is recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, both with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that an investment in an associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment, which is recognised in the Income Statement, as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value. 1.4.2. Critical Accounting Judgements –– Judgement is required to determine whether periods covered by an option to extend a lease are reasonably certain to be exercised and whether periods covered by an option to terminate a lease are reasonably certain not to be exercised, when assessing the lease term. In making this assessment, the Group applies judgement to all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend or terminate the lease. These include past practice regarding the period over which it has typically used particular types of assets, the length of the non-cancellable period of the lease, contractual terms and conditions for the optional periods compared with market rates, the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives, the length of the non-cancellable period of the lease, significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the term of the contract, and costs relating to terminating or extending the lease. Past practice regarding the period over which it has typically used particular types of assets is the most significant factor in this decision. For manufacturing facilities this decision is also informed by the expected remaining life of the vehicle platforms produced in the facility. _Financial assets at FVTPL_ A financial asset is classified in this category if it does not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial asset at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. These contracts are marked to market by re-measuring them to fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement. _Financial Assets at amortised cost_ Assets at amortised cost are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and where the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost comprise ‘trade and other receivables excluding prepayments’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’. _Offsetting financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Impairment of financial assets_ The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets at amortised cost or at FVTPL. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group recognises expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument ‘lifetime ECL’. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL only when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument’s external credit rating where available; significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk for a particular financial instrument e.g. a significant increase in the credit spread or the credit default swap prices for the debtor, indications that any debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in payments, an increase in the probability that any debtor will enter bankruptcy, or other financial reorganisation, and where observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 1.10.2. Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at ‘FVTPL’ or ‘liabilities at amortised cost’. Financial liabilities are recognised initially on the date at which the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. _Financial liabilities at amortised cost_ The classification of financial liabilities at amortised cost is determined at the time of initial recognition and depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial liabilities and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Financial liabilities at amortised cost, including borrowings, trade and other payables, excluding deferred income and lease liabilities (after the adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019), and are measured using the effective interest method, which calculates the amortised cost of a financial liability and allocates interest expense over its term. The effective interest rate discounts estimated cash payments (including all issuance discounts and transactions costs) through the expected life of the financial liability, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Borrowings, including extensions to existing agreements, are recognised initially at fair value, net of discounts and transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Interest arising on financial instruments is recognised on an accruals basis. In assessing whether a debt alteration is to be treated as a modification or an extinguishment and new arrangement, an evaluation is made of the qualitative factors such as the underlying parties to the transaction and quantitative factors such as the impact on the net present value of remaining cash flows. A gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement at the date of the modification of a financial liability. _Financial liabilities at FVTPL_ A financial liability is classified in this category if it does not not meet the criteria for recognition as a financial liability at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified in this category unless they are designated as in hedging relationships. The Group enters into conventional derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risks, mostly foreign exchange forward contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 26. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into, and are subsequently marked to market by re-measuring to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are accounted for in accordance with the hedge accounting policy below. ----- 1.10.3. Hedge Accounting The Group enters into derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at each Balance Sheet date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: –– Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge); –– Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge). At the inception of a hedging transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The Group’s cost of hedging, the time value of options and forward element of forward contracts are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to profit and loss over time. _Cash flow hedges_ The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and variability in cash flows relating to US dollar borrowings. The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk arising from its borrowings, which fix the interest rate for a portion of the borrowings. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately within finance income or expense in the Income Statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued for these cash flow hedges, the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is treated as follows: (i) If the hedged future cash flows for the US dollar borrowings are still expected to occur, that amount remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until the future interest or borrowings cash flows occur, or until that amount is a loss, and it is expected that all, or a portion of that loss, will not be recovered in one or more future periods. In those circumstances, the amount that is not expected to be recovered is immediately transferred to finance income or expense in the Income Statement as a reclassification adjustment. (ii) If the hedged future cash flows for the US dollar borrowings are no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the cash flow hedge reserve is immediately transferred to finance income or expense in the Income Statement as a reclassification adjustment. _Net investment hedges_ Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument, relating to the effective portion of the hedge, is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. The fair values of derivatives, which are not designated as part of a hedging relationship, are classified as current assets or liabilities. Step 2: The performance obligation within a piece part release order is to manufacture and deliver the specified volume of requested parts. The performance obligation of a TPD order is to construct or undertake the relevant tooling and development activities. Where the different obligations are separable, in terms of both capability and within the contractual documentation, they are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. Further details regarding the nature of goods and services sold is included in Note 2. Step 3: The fair value of consideration receivable is the transaction price specified in the relevant release order or purchase order, net of returns, discounts, sales taxes and volume rebates. For piece part revenue, the price is fixed at the given release order (contract) and does not include any element of variable consideration. For TPD revenue, where uncertainty exists as to the amount of consideration that will ultimately be recognised, the transaction price is constrained until such uncertainty is resolved. Amounts invoiced in excess of the transaction price will be reflected as pricing accruals or revenue deferrals. Step 4: The transaction price established in step 3 is allocated to the distinct performance obligations identified in step 2. Step 5: Revenue is recognised on satisfaction of the specified performance obligations, consistent with the passing of control of the goods and services. For piece part revenue, control is deemed to have passed at the point in time delivery of the parts specified in the applicable release order is made. Where consignment arrangements apply, revenue is only recognised when control of the underlying inventory has passed to the customer. For TPD activities, control is deemed to have passed once production part approval process (‘PPAP’) or start of production (‘SOP’) has been achieved, depending on the specific terms of the agreement. Costs incurred up until this point are recognised as work-inprogress on the Balance Sheet and reviewed regularly for impairment should their future recovery become doubtful. Upfront deposits and progress billings are recorded in deferred revenue, until point of recognition. Contract Costs Incremental costs incurred in obtaining a contract are capitalised and amortised over the applicable programme life, with regular review for impairment. Other pre-contract costs and costs of fulfilment are expensed as incurred unless future economic benefit is evident, or if applicable, within the scope of other standards. Impairment Contract assets arise where a performance obligation has been satisfied but amounts due have not been fully recognised within trade receivables. Contract assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan provides an amount of benefit that an employee will receive at a later date, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, periods of service and compensation. Defined benefit arrangements in the Group include funded and unfunded pension plans, post-employment healthcare, statutory termination indemnities and long service awards. The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation (‘DBO’) at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. Where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the DBO, an asset is recognised only to the extent of future economic benefits accruing to the Group either as cash refunds or as a reduction in contributions. The service cost of providing benefits for funded plans accruing during the year and any past service costs are charged as an operating expense. The interest cost or credit arising from the unwinding of the discount on the net actuarial liability or asset is recognised in the Income Statement as finance expense or income. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. The DBO is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the DBO is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related benefit obligation. Defined benefit plans – funded The Group operates funded pension plans in the US, Canada and UK. The US plans are subject to annual actuarial review, whilst the others are formally valued at least triennially. Assets are held in trusts and are separately administered from the Group’s activities. Assets include readily marketable equities, credit, and diversified growth/multi-strategy funds, and qualifying insurance policies, and are valued at fair value. The Group makes contributions based on actuarial advice sufficient to meet the liabilities of the plans. Defined benefit plans – unfunded including healthcare The Group operates unfunded employment benefit plans in certain countries of which the most significant are post-employment healthcare in the US, a closed arrangement, and pension plans in Germany. Other liabilities include statutory termination indemnities and long service awards. Share-based compensation The fair value of equity-settled payments to employees is determined at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expense is recognised in the Income Statement on the straight-line basis over the period that the employees become entitled to the awards. The credit entry relating to the awards is recorded in equity (Note 7). The Group reviews the estimate of the number of shares expected to vest at each balance sheet date. The total amount expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, including any market performance and any non-vesting conditions, and excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions. Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. Deferred tax Deferred income tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities, where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the Group and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred to the former owners of the acquiree for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred, and any equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. A list of subsidiaries and their countries of incorporation is presented in Note 4 of the Parent Company’s financial statements.

Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are converted using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. All transactional foreign currency differences are included in the Income Statement. 1.3.2. Foreign Operations Foreign operations are those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not Euro. For the purposes of consolidation, income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Euro at average exchange rates for the year, and assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements,267.184.1,,"The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates and for management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. Assumptions and accounting estimates are subject to regular review, governed by Groupwide policies and controls. Any revisions required to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the revisions are made including all future periods affected. During the year, the Group has reassessed its critical accounting estimates and judgements to ensure these include only estimates which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period, and judgements when applying the Group’s accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The reassessment by the Group considered the range of possible outcomes in respect of income tax liabilities, recoverability of capitalised development costs, warranty and other provisions and the potential change from using alternative sources of information within the valuation of derivative financial instruments to be narrow and therefore these are no longer considered areas of critical estimates. Similarly, judgements in respect of income tax, capitalised development costs, the determination of cash-generating units and application of hedge accounting are no longer considered areas of critical judgement. The judgement and estimate that have the most significant and critical effect on the amounts included in the financial statements are described below: 1.4.1. Critical Accounting Estimates –– Costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefit plans are calculated on the basis of a range of assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary growth and mortality assumptions.

Goodwill,267.186.1,,"Initial measurement Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of non-controlling interests over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the total of consideration transferred, non‑controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement. Subsequent measurement Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee. Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to impairment testing which is performed annually or when an impairment trigger event occurs. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination which generated the goodwill. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. CGUs comprise the two operating segments each sub-divided into four geographic territories. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised where the costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the project and to use or sell the development asset. Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Development expenditure, which does not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, is recognised in the Income Statement as incurred. Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred. Amortisation Amortisation is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current year are as follows: –– Capitalised development expenses 5-10 years (over the life of the production cycle) –– Computer software and licenses 3-6 years –– Technology 4-8 years –– Customer platforms 11-25 years Intangible assets that are under development are not amortised until they are brought into use.

Assets acquired as part of the acquisition of the Group are valued at fair value as part of the acquisition accounting. Land is not depreciated. When major components of an item of PP&E have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items. Depreciation of PP&E is calculated using the straight-line method, reflecting expected patterns of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the assets, to allocate their cost less residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: –– Freehold buildings 30-50 years –– Leased buildings improvements 30-50 years or the period of the lease if shorter –– Plant, machinery and equipment 3-20 years Depreciation is not charged on assets in the course of construction. Once completed these are transferred to the relevant category above and depreciated accordingly. Enhancement expenditure of PP&E items is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of replaced parts is de-recognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Income Statement as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals of PP&E are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount, and are recognised net within other income in the Income Statement.

The policy below is relevant only to amounts reported in the comparative year under IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and IFRIC 4 ‘Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease’. Assets held under leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to purchased assets of that asset type and depreciated accordingly. Each finance lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The future rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the Income Statement over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Revenue in the course of ordinary activities is measured and recognised using the five-step approach outlined in IFRS 15: 1. Identify the contract with the customer 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract 3. Determine the transaction price 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 5. Recognise revenue when the entity satisfies the performance obligations Step 1: To be recognised as a contract, there must be appropriate approval from both parties and clear identification of each party’s rights under the agreement. The payment terms should be evident, with collection of consideration probable. The Group’s customer arrangements take a variety of forms, with typical contractual frameworks comprising: master terms and conditions, programme award letters, purchase orders and release orders. For piece part revenue, volume requirements and mutually enforceable terms are established on the customer issuance of a release order and therefore this is the relevant accounting unit of contract.

Tax is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income and equity. Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable profit or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Uncertain tax positions The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude. Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions, which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic positions. Management uses in-house tax experts, professional advisers and previous experience when assessing tax risks. Depending on their nature, estimates of interest and penalties are included either in interest payable or in tax liabilities. As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments may arise which have a material impact on the Group’s tax rate and/or cash tax payments. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable profits. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.

Foreign Currency Risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on revenue, purchases, investments and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies of individual Group entities, which are primarily Euro, US dollars, Chinese renminbi and Korean won. Where possible, business entities sell in prices denominated in the same currency as the majority of their costs, to produce a natural hedge. At the reporting date, the majority of cash and cash equivalents in the Group were denominated in Euro, US dollars and Chinese renminbi. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage much of the residual transactional currency risk. Derivative instruments used by the Group to manage foreign currency exposure fall under the following main categories: Forward foreign exchange contracts – not designated in hedge relationships The nominal value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2019 was €180.8 million (31 December 2018: €172.7 million) and the aggregate fair value was €1.4 million receivable (31 December 2018: €1.3 million payable).

In aggregate, these instruments converted a portion of the drawings under the main borrowing facilities of $400.0 million at floating interest rates into €355.0 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.2%. These contracts hedge foreign exchange exposure on US dollar-based intra-Group borrowings, in Euro functional-currency Group entities. The average strike price in these contracts is 1.16 US dollar to the Euro. The hedge ratio of this economic relationship is 1:1. The nominal value of the forward foreign exchange contracts in this arrangement as at 31 December 2019 was €564.7 million (31 December 2018: €590.6 million), and their aggregate fair value was €8.8 million receivable (31 December 2018: €20.8m payable).

An ineffectiveness loss of €0.2 million (31 December 2018: €0.6 million loss) was recorded in the Income Statement (Note 11).

The Group’s exposure to a +/- 1% change in Euro/KRW exchange rate would be a €0.1 million profit/€0.1 million loss arising from those Euro/KRW contracts that do not qualify for investment hedge accounting. Those Euro/KRW contracts that qualified for hedge accounting impact equity; however, that movement would be offset by a substantially equal and opposite movement arising from the Group’s exposure to the net investment in KRW subsidiaries. The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in the Euro/US dollar exchange rates arises from US dollar denominated intercompany financial instruments, which are partially offset by forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges held at the Balance Sheet date. The profit and loss impact associated with these hedges and the related financial instrument exposure is not significant due to the application of hedge accounting. The Group’s net Income Statement exposure to Euro/US dollar contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and the net unhedged intercompany loans subject to Euro/US dollar risk is also insignificant. All the Group’s current hedging instruments including those which manage interest rate risk, as detailed below, will have expired by the end of October 2020. The Group is currently reviewing its hedging programme in the context of its external and intercompany borrowings in order to determine which of these instruments will be replaced. 3.3.2. Interest Rate Risk Most of the Group’s interest rate risk arises on its main external borrowing facilities. The interest expense arising from the secured term loans, denominated in US dollars and Euro, are based on floating rates of respectively, one-month US dollar LIBOR (minimum 0.75%) +2.5% p.a. and three-month EURIBOR (minimum 0.75%) +2.75% p.a. Interest rate swaps As noted above, the Group has used interest rate swaps to manage the risk and used such contracts, together with the forward foreign exchange contracts to fix in €355.0 million of debt at 4.2%. The notional value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2019 was $400.0 million (31 December 2018: $400.0 million) and their fair value was €1.1 million receivable (31 December 2018: €7.7 million receivable). In aggregate, a fair value loss of €3.2 million (31 December 2018: €2.7 million gain) has been recorded in other comprehensive income during the year and a €3.6 million gain (31 December 2018: €2.5 million gain) was subsequently recycled to the income statement. No ineffectiveness was recorded in the Income Statement. Interest rate floors The aggregate fair value of these derivatives as at 31 December 2019 was €1.3 million payable (31 December 2018: €2.6 million payable). Sensitivity analysis If interest rates had been 100 bps higher or lower with all other variables held constant, after taking account of hedging arrangements, the pre-tax profit or loss on an annual basis would be, respectively €3.9 million lower or €3.9 million higher. There would be no significant impact on equity. Other financial matters In its normal course of business, the Group does not offer supplier financing arrangements and has not engaged any financial provider to provide these services to parties in the supply chain.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411

Under the plan, awards are made comprising of two tranches (including an outperformance target for Executive Directors) each with a separate performance condition, as outlined in the below table. Vesting is over three years from date of grant and contingent on continued service and attainment of the applicable performance condition, within the three-year performance period.

Award holders are entitled to a dividend equivalent payment, in respect of their conditional awards, for all ordinary dividends that are declared and paid between the award date and the settlement date. These may be paid in cash at the date of vesting, or paid in the form of additional conditional awards, subject to the same conditions as the original grant. As the awards are settled in shares of the Company, or cash at the discretion of the Company, they are accounted for as equitysettled awards under IFRS 2 and fair valued at date of grant using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (EPS tranche) and Monte Carlo simulation (TSR tranche). The fair value is recognised in the Income Statement straight line over the vesting period, with the anticipated number of awards vesting adjusted for management’s estimate of forfeiture rate and attainment of non-market-based performance conditions. Achievement of market-based performance conditions is reflected in the initial fair value of the award. The weighted average fair value of awards granted in the year was €1.89 (2018: €2.78). The assumptions used for the grants in the year included a weighted average share price of €2.22 (2018: €3.01), expected option life of 3 years (2018: 3 years), expected volatility of 37.6% (2018: 32.8%) and a weighted average risk free interest rate of 0.71% (2018: 0.85%).

Intangibles assets are amortised over their useful economic life, which range from 3 to 25 years. The annual impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the non-financial assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results. During the year, the non-financial assets of the Group were tested for impairment, with all CGUs demonstrating a recoverable amount in excess of their carrying value and therefore no impairment charge has been recorded. The recoverable amount for the CGUs has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation. These calculations use cash flow projections from financial plans approved by the Board, covering a five-year period, plus a terminal value. The Group initially calculates value-in-use using post-tax cash flows discounted at post-tax discount rates, to approximate the outcome of a pre-tax model. Where this approach demonstrates significant headroom at a CGU level, management conclude that no indicators of impairment exist. If a CGU exhibits negative headroom, or is deemed to be sensitive to a reasonably possible change in key input assumptions, then further quantification of recoverable amount is assessed using a pre-tax value-in-use model and fair value less cost of disposal techniques where necessary. The key assumptions used in the calculations are the long-term expected growth rate, the discount rate applied to forecast cash flows and the achievement of the cash flow forecasts themselves. These key input assumptions are determined using the services of third party valuation experts and utilise externally available sources of information, adjusted where relevant for industry specific factors. Long-term growth rates are based on long-term economic forecasts for growth in the automotive sector in the geographical regions in which the CGUs operate. Discount rates are calculated for each Division using a weighted average cost of capital specific to the geographical regions from which the cash flows are derived. Forecast operating cash flows are established using latest expectations of demand for products and are benchmarked by applying expected product margins to external automotive volume forecasts issued by global information provider ‘IHS Markit’.

Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included for valuation purposes in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

Defined Benefit Arrangements,267.355.1,,"Pension plans The Group operates funded defined benefit pension plans in the US, Canada and the UK under broadly similar regulatory frameworks. All of the plans provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of pensions provided is determined by members’ length of service and, for most of these plans, pensionable remuneration. Plan assets are held in trusts from which all benefit payments are made. The plans are governed by local regulations and practice, including the nature of the relationship between their trustees and the Group. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment strategy and schedules of contributions, rests primarily with the trustees, some of whom are appointed by the Group and the remainder by the members in accordance with the rules of each plan. There are five plans in the US, four of which are closed to both new entrants and future accrual, and one of which is closed to new entrants but permits future accrual. The active members are not required to make contributions to the plans. Pensions in payment are not subject to inflationary increase. The plan in Canada remains open to new entrants, and is contributory. Pensions in payment are subject to discretionary inflationary increase. The UK plan is closed to new entrants but remains open to future accrual. Pensions in payment are subject to annual increase based on the UK Retail Price Index. Independent accounting valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out as at 31 December 2019. The US pension plans are subject to annual actuarial valuation, and were most recently valued by independent qualified actuaries as at 1 January 2019. The Canadian plan is subject to actuarial valuation at least triennially, and was most recently formally valued as at 31 December 2017. The UK plan is subject to triennial actuarial valuation, and was most recently formally valued as at 6 April 2018. Employer funding contributions to the US and other pension plans are agreed at each formal valuation, and for the year ended 31 December 2019 totalled €5.0 million (2018: €5.3 million). Contributions for the 12 months ended 31 December 2020 are expected to amount to €7.8 million. In this note the US plans are shown separately as ‘US pensions’, and the Canadian and UK plans are aggregated as ‘other pensions’. Post-employment healthcare The Group operates post-employment medical benefit schemes in a small number of territories, principally the US where the scheme was closed to new entrants in 1992. These schemes are unfunded. The US scheme is subject to annual actuarial valuation, and was most recently valued by independent qualified actuaries as at 1 January 2019. In this note the US scheme is shown separately as ‘US healthcare’, and the other healthcare liabilities are aggregated within ‘other post-employment liabilities’. Other post-employment arrangements The Group operates certain other pension and retirement plans primarily in Germany, France, Italy, Korea, Poland and Belgium, where obligations are either partially funded or unfunded.

505_2,Offerings 2021.md,267,FTDS,267.384,27.6. Pension Plans – Risk Analysis,267.384.1,,"Asset volatility Plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If plan assets were to underperform this yield, this would create a deficit. All the funded plans hold a proportion of equities, which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, but which are also likely to experience greater price volatility and therefore risk in the short term. As plans mature, the Group’s strategy is to reduce the level of investment risk by investing more in assets whose risk profile is a better match for the liabilities. Changes in bond yields A decrease in bond yields has the effect of increasing plan liabilities, although this is partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ bond holdings. Inflation risk The Group’s pension obligations in Canada, the UK and Germany are inflation linked. Caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the plans against above normal inflation. The US pension obligations are not inflation indexed. The majority of the plan assets are not directly inflation indexed, meaning that an increase in inflation will tend to increase the deficit. Life expectancy The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of each retired member and his/ her spouse, so increases in life expectancy result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities. The investments of the funded plans are managed within an asset-liability matching framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that align with the obligations of the plans. One objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in annuities and long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due in the appropriate currency. The plans actively monitor how the duration and the expected yield of the investments match the expected cash outflows arising from the pension obligations. The processes used to manage the risks have not changed from previous years. Investments are diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets. A large portion of assets consist of bonds and equities, although the plans also hold investment funds and liability driven investments. Equities have been shown to offer the best returns over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.",N/A,as_expected,2021,411
