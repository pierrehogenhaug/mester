**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors:** The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in
the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined
in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”)
for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in

basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. The Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined
in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional
client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation, as it
forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key
information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the


-----

EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of such Notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of
the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**Additional Notice for Investors in the United Kingdom: The Offering Memorandum is not being**
distributed, nor has it been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of the FSMA by an authorized person under

the Offering Memorandum or its contents. The Notes are not being offered to the public in the United Kingdom.

**MiFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for**
the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients
only, each as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor
subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**UK MiFIR Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for**
the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes

600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and (ii) all channels for distribution of the

or recommending the Notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a UK distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

amount of the Senior Secured Notes remains outstanding after the redemption. Prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may also,
during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue Date, redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Additionally, at any time following the occurrence of any Initial Public Offering (as defined herein), the Issuer may, at its
option, redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash

such permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained, and
settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. Any investor or potential

be         business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”)) following the date of pricing of the Senior Secured Notes

**Notice to certain European Investors**

**_European Economic Area_**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor
as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes in any member state of the EEA will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels for distribution of
the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Senior Secured Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook
Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be

that could affect its future performance and the industry in which it operates. Moreover, the Group operates in a
very competitive and rapidly changing environment. It may face new risks from time to time, and it is not possible
to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on its business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements as a prediction of actual results.

The Issuer undertakes no obligation, and does not intend, to release publicly the result of any revisions
to these forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this
Offering Memorandum, including changes in its business or strategy or planned capital expenditure, or to reflect
the occurrence of unanticipated events. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable
to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under “Risk
_Factors.”_

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

We have presented certain information in this Offering Memorandum that is not required by, nor
presented in accordance with, IFRS to evaluate our operating and financial performance. Please see “Summary—
_Summary Historical and Other Financial Information.” As used in this Offering Memorandum, our key non-IFRS_
financial measures include:

    - Organic net sales growth/(decrease): Organic net sales growth/(decrease) presents a “like-for-like”
comparative growth rate, and represents the change in net sales for the current period compared to
the prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis and by eliminating any change in scope
between the relevant periods.

Such change in scope between periods may result from: (i) an acquisition, divestiture or disposal of
our business in a country or a major market or that of a business unit; (ii) changes to the business
model under which we operate in a specific market, or with respect to the manner in which a
particular product is (or particular products are) sold by us in that market (for example, if we change
our local operating model from a distributor model to a royalty model, or if we change from thirdparty manufacturing (wherein such third-party manufacturer typically sources raw materials) to toll
manufacturing (wherein we typically supply raw materials to a third party manufacturer) or (iii) the
adoption of an accounting standard or a change in the application of an accounting principle, if
applicable. We commenced calculating organic net sales growth/(decrease) beginning for the year
ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we present organic net sales growth/(decrease) for the year
ended December 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 and the
twelve months ended March 31, 2024 only.

The constant currency exchange rate is calculated using the measures described below under “—
_Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures.”_

    - Constant currency net sales growth: Represents the change in net sales for the relevant period
compared to the prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis (as described under “—
_Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures”). We present constant currency net sales growth for_
the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 only. We commenced calculating
organic net sales growth/(decrease) beginning for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly,
we present organic net sales growth/(decrease) for the year ended December 31, 2023, the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

    - Constant currency gross profit (decrease)/growth: Represents the growth rate of our reported gross
profit (which is our net sales minus cost of sales) calculated on a constant currency basis (as
described under “—Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures”).

    - Gross margin: Represents net sales minus cost of sales divided by net sales, and expressed as a
percentage.

    - Constant currency gross margin (decrease)/growth: Represents the growth rate of our reported gross
margin calculated on a constant currency basis (as described under “—Constant Currency Exchange
_Rate Measures”)._

    - Normalized EBITDA: Represents net profit/(loss) before income tax expense, net finance costs,
depreciation of property, plant and equipment (including right of use assets) and amortization of
intangible assets, as adjusted for share-based payment expenses and certain non-underlying items
that we do not consider to be part of the Group’s daily business operations due to the nature,
frequency and predictability of their occurrence, in each case, as described under the section titled
“Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information—Key Financial Data.”

xi


-----

    - Normalized EBIT: Represents our net profit/(loss) before income tax expense and net finance costs,
as adjusted for share-based payment expenses and other non-underlying items for which our
Normalized EBITDA is adjusted.

    - Constant currency Normalized EBITDA growth: Represents the growth rate of our Normalized
EBITDA calculated on a constant currency basis (as described under “—Constant Currency
_Exchange Rate Measures”)._

    - Normalized free cash flow: Represents cash generated from operating activities less net capital
expenditure, plus net cash inflows/outflows from non-underlying operating and capital items that
we do not consider to be part of the Group’s daily business operations due to the nature, frequency
and predictability of their occurrence, in each case, as described under the section titled “Summary—
_Summary Historical and Other Financial Information—Key Financial Data.”_

    - Normalized free cash conversion ratio: Represents normalized free cash flow divided by Normalized
EBITDA, expressed as a percentage.

    - Normalized EBITDA margin: Represents our Normalized EBITDA divided by net sales, expressed
as a percentage.

    - Constant currency Normalized EBITDA margin (decrease)/growth: Represents growth rate of our
Normalized EBITDA margin calculated on a constant currency basis (as described under “—
_Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures”)._

    - Pricing contribution: Represents the relative contribution to organic net sales growth/(decrease)
and/or constant currency net sales growth of changes in product prices for the current period
compared to the prior period.

    - Volume/mix contribution: Represents the relative contribution to organic net sales
growth/(decrease) and/or constant currency net sales growth of changes in volume/mix for the
current period compared to the prior period.

    - Underlying volume/mix contribution: Represents the relative contribution to organic net sales
growth/(decrease) and/or constant currency net sales growth of changes in volume/mix, adjusted
for the impact of the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization, renovation and other self-directed
initiatives for the current period compared to the prior period, which we have calculated for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 only.

    - Historical leverage ratio: Our historical leverage ratio represents the ratio of our (i) net debt, which
is defined as our financial liabilities gross of unamortized financing fees less cash and cash
equivalents, excluding lease liabilities and derivative financial instruments to (ii) Normalized
EBITDA.

Our management believes that the foregoing non-IFRS financial measures are helpful indicators of the
underlying performance or liquidity of the business. Management believes that the foregoing non-IFRS financial
measures are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and
ability to service debt and, because these measures are used by management to track business evolution, establish
operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions. In addition, these measures are commonly
used by investors, security analysts and other interested parties in our industry as supplemental measures of
operating performance or liquidity. Although we present these measures to enhance the understanding of our
historical operating performance, they should not be considered alternatives to operating profit as an indicator of
operating performance or profitability, or alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of
liquidity.

You should not consider organic net sales growth/(decrease), constant currency net sales growth, constant
currency gross profit (decrease)/growth, constant currency gross margin (decrease)/growth, Normalized EBITDA,
Normalized EBIT, constant currency Normalized EBITDA growth, normalized free cash flow, normalized free
cash conversion ratio, normalized EBITDA margin, constant currency normalized EBITDA margin
(decrease)/growth, pricing contribution, volume/mix contribution, underlying volume/mix contribution, historical
leverage ratio or any other non-IFRS measures presented herein as alternatives to measures of financial
performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such as gross profit or

xii


-----

operating profit, as a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of liquidity. These metrics, which we
believe are helpful indicators of the underlying performance or liquidity of the business, are not measures of
financial performance under IFRS. In addition, the Company’s computation of Normalized EBITDA, Normalized
EBIT and other non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures or ratios used by other
companies.

In particular, Normalized EBITDA and Normalized EBIT have limitations as analytical tools, and you
should not consider any of them in isolation. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect
changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs, (ii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash
requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt and (iii) although depreciation and
amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in
the future, and these metrics do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements,
or other future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments.

Such measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have not been audited or reviewed by our
auditors nor prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of
consolidated financial information in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to and does not comply with the
reporting requirements of the SEC which would apply if the offering of the Senior Secured Notes was being

**_Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures_**

We are a geographically diversified business with operations around the world and accordingly we
undertake transactions in various currencies. Many of our subsidiaries report their financial results in currencies
other than the euro, the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risks and such may have a_
_material adverse effect on our results of operations.” To enhance the comparability of our historical financial_
results between the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2024, in certain instances in this Offering Memorandum such results are presented using constant currency
exchange rates. Measures calculated using constant currency exchange rates are unaudited, not presented in
accordance with IFRS, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should
not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any financial measure under IFRS.

The exchange rates used for the calculation of constant currency exchange rate measures presented in
this Offering Memorandum for a particular period represent the average exchange rates of the relevant currency
for the prior period. Set forth below are the exchange rates used by us to calculate constant currency exchange
rate measures in respect of our principal currencies for the periods mentioned below. For each of these periods,
the exchange rates mentioned below represent the average exchange rates of the relevant currency for the prior
period.

**Adjusted Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum also includes certain unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information,
including adjusted cash and cash equivalents, adjusted total debt, adjusted net total debt, adjusted total senior
secured debt, adjusted net total senior secured debt, adjusted total interest expense and certain leverage and
coverage ratios. Such measures reflect the following:

    - Adjusted cash and cash equivalents is calculated as cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024,
adjusted to give effect to our estimated cash position after giving effect to the Transactions, as if
they had occurred on March 31, 2024. Adjusted cash and cash equivalents is not adjusted for
ordinary course movements in our cash and cash equivalents after March 31, 2024.

    - Adjusted total debt is our total debt that has been adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, as if
they had occurred on March 31, 2024, consisting of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, the
Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Term Facilities, the Senior Notes outstanding following the
completion of the Transactions and lease liabilities under IFRS 16 (Leases). Adjusted net total debt
represents our adjusted total debt less adjusted cash and cash equivalents.

    - Adjusted total senior secured debt is our adjusted total debt that is senior secured debt, consisting
of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, the Revolving Credit Facility and the the Senior Term
Facilities. Adjusted net total senior secured debt represents our adjusted total senior secured debt
less adjusted cash and cash equivalents.

    - Adjusted total interest expense is interest expense with respect to our adjusted total debt, excluding
any interest expense associated with lease liabilities, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions,
including the issuances of the Senior Secured Notes and the use of proceeds therefrom, as if they
had occurred on April 1, 2023.

Such adjusted measures are not financial measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Such adjusted consolidated financial
information has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors. As all companies do not calculate these financial
measures in the same manner, the presentation of each financial measure may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures used by other companies. The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information has not been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus
Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. The unaudited
adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.
Neither the assumptions underlying the unaudited adjustments nor the resulting unaudited adjusted financial
consolidated information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing
standards.

The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information has been provided for informational purposes
only. Results indicated by certain of these measures may not be realized, and funds depicted by certain of these
measures may not be available for management’s discretionary use if such results are not realized. Further, the
unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information does not purport to indicate our future consolidated results
of operations or our cash position or financial position as at any future date. The actual results may differ
significantly from those reflected in the unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information for a number of
reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the unaudited adjusted
consolidated financial information. The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information, and the related
assumptions, are for illustrative purposes only.

The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in “Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information,” “Selected
_Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements included in this Offering_
Memorandum.

**Provider”). Unless otherwise stated, industry data in this Offering Memorandum from Industry Data Providers**
was sourced at various points in time and reflects the data available at such point in time and does not reflect
further updates after it was sourced.

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately
reproduced by us in this Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the
information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced

contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of data on which our estimates are based.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimations of market data and information derived from such

**Overview**

We are a global leader in plant-based food, established in 2018, as a purpose-driven company with a
clear vision: “To make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that
is good for you and good for our planet.”

We develop, produce, distribute and market plant-based dairy alternative products in over 100 countries
across four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses. Backed by a rich heritage and a
global scale, we are highly differentiated in the plant-based sector. Our reinvigorated iconic power brands reflect
over 150 years of product expertise and brand heritage and are trusted by consumers globally. Our scale, culture
and capabilities, including extensive food technology and innovation expertise, our community of dedicated
“Upfielders,” consisting of our management team and employees, and our 14 manufacturing facilities across five
continents, provide a strong value proposition for our customers and consumers, and ensure we are well positioned
to advance the future of food.

Our products are marketed under a family of historic and iconic brands with strong recognition in their
target markets. Our products are made with natural and sustainably sourced ingredients. Our carefully selected
ingredients come from a diversified supply chain to minimize risk and environmental impact and maximize taste,
functionality, health, affordability and sustainability for our consumers.

Our operations are diversified across three regions, namely Europe, the Americas and AMEA. We hold
leadership positions in the global butter and spreads, and plant cheese segments, with leadership positions in
creams in Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets. We sell our products across these regions
primarily through retail channels, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and other outlets. In
addition, through our professional foodservice channel, we sell our products to commercial outlets, such as quick
service restaurants, bakeries, pizza and pasta outlets, hotels, catering and industrial kitchens, and to the social
sector, such as educational institutions, workplaces and hospitals.

During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, our net sales were €2,793 million, €3,375
million and €3,275 million, respectively. During the same periods, our operating profit was €288 million, €453
million and €570 million, and our Normalized EBITDA was €666 million, €749 million and €831 million,
respectively. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our net sales were €3,209 million, our operating
profit was €604 million and Normalized EBITDA was €862 million.

**_Our Successful Transformation_**

Following the acquisition of our business by KKR in 2018, we began a journey to separate, transform
and reinvent our business, building on our existing strong foundations: a global platform with iconic power brands
and world-class knowledge.

Our journey took more than four years, with the wholescale transformational part of our journey
completed in 2022. To become an independent business, we focused on separating and stabilizing our business,
simplifying, renovating and innovating our product portfolio, expanding into new product categories, investing in
R&D through the opening of a new Food Science Centre, optimizing our supply chain, building an end-to-end
globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform and building a new IT infrastructure. See “Business—History” for
a detailed description of our transformation journey.

Building on our existing strong foundations and as a result of the significant industrial, digital and cultural
transformation undertaken since 2018, we believe we are well positioned to advance the future of food.

**Strengths**

**_We are well positioned to advance the Future of Food in a large and growing TAM_**

We believe that the future of food lies in tasty, high-quality, responsibly made, plant-based food.
Transforming the food system by increasing the consumption of plant-based foods in our diets is the key to address
the impact of what we eat on climate, nature and health. As a global leader in plant-based food, offering our
products in four large and growing categories and selling into over 100 countries worldwide, we are well
positioned to advance the future of food and to meet the growing shift in consumer preferences to plant-based
eating. To inspire more people to eat plant-based alternatives, we focus on delivering tasty, high performing,
healthy, sustainable and affordable products. We believe that there should be no compromise for consumers when
they change to plant-based products as compared to dairy alternatives.

We benefit from a senior management team with significant experience in the consumer-packaged goods
industry. A majority of our current senior management team has been with us since our acquisition by KKR in
2018, and has been critical in our successful transformation. Under their leadership, we have separated,
transformed and reinvented our business as a global leader in plant-based food and strongly positioned our
business to drive conversion to plant-based alternatives. We believe that our senior management team has also
been instrumental in developing a strong and motivated organization with a purpose- and performance-driven
culture, which is carried by a passionate and engaged community of “Upfielders.” We believe that our community
of “Upfielders” are aligned with our purpose, and are highly motivated to make an impact, deliver sustainable,
purposeful long-term growth and advance the transition to a plant-based food future.

Our ability to advance the future of food is further strengthened by our portfolio of Plant Butter and
Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses products, sold through our reinvigorated and iconic brands, our
global scale and manufacturing footprint, our food technology and innovation expertise which together provide a
strong value proposition for our customers and consumers.

We offer these plant-based products in our four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids
and Cheeses, which provide us access to a large and growing TAM (across both dairy and non-dairy) of
approximately €151 billion as of 2022, which is 15 times larger than our TAM of approximately €11 billion in
2017 under our previous ownership (which was focused on plant-based spreads (margarines)). Our expansion into
the Butter, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses categories, in addition to Spreads, resulted in an expansion of our TAM.
While currently the penetration of plant-based products in the Butters, Creams and Cheeses categories is low, and
estimated at less than 1%, there is a potential opportunity of approximately €23 billion (based on an incremental
€7 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 5% plant-based penetration) or €38 billion (based
on an incremental €22 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 16% plant-based penetration)
(see also “Industry—Upfield’s TAM”). We believe that our global footprint and renovated and innovative product
portfolio provide a significant growth opportunity in our TAM. Within our TAM (which covers both dairy and
non-dairy products), given the growing consumer preference for plant-based diets in the backdrop of
environmental, sustainability and health concerns, there is potential for increased rate of conversion to plant-based
products, which we are well positioned to leverage, especially given our strong position globally and in the key
markets in which we operate. For instance, according to NielsenIQ measurement data, within our Plant Butter and
Spreads core category, which contributed 81% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are the
largest producer globally in terms of market share and hold leading positions across some of the largest butter and
spreads markets globally, including North America, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, according to
NielsenIQ measurement data, we are the global leader in the plant cheese segment, and have leadership positions
in creams in Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets.

**_A reinvigorated portfolio of brands reshaping the future of food_**

With our portfolio of trusted brands we believe we can drive conversion to plant-based food and leverage
our strong market positions going forward. Our brand platforms are led by our power brands, our most iconic
brands, which have a long history and heritage. We believe that our power brands are deeply rooted and trusted
by our consumers and customers across a number of our markets and have high brand awareness in their respective
markets. These brands include, for example, Flora (launched in 1964), Country Crock (launched in 1954), Becel
+ProActiv (Becel launched in 1962 and ProActiv launched in 2000), Rama (launched in 1924), BlueBand
(launched in 1916) and Violife (acquired in 2020). In addition to our power brands, we also have a number of
country or region specific brands with a strong local heritage and brand awareness, such as Lätta in Sweden, Stork
in the United Kingdom and Tulipan in Spain.

2


-----

Following our acquisition by KKR, we have also reorganized and reinvigorated our brand portfolio since
2018. We refreshed our brands around our end-to-end brand platforms, so as to provide for better harmonization
and efficiencies across our R&D and innovation pipeline, sales and marketing and supply chain activities. Our
brand platforms are founded upon key prerequisites of taste and affordability, but each platform serves a distinct
consumer need and is mapped against the key usage occasions and growth opportunities across our categories and
markets.

We also organize our brands across three different price tiers: “good,” (targeting price sensitive
customers) “better” (targeting customers looking for additional product benefits at a more affordable price than a
dairy alternative) and “best” (targeting customers seeking premium products with multiple features, such as
lowering cholesterol). We assign our brands and products across these tiers which are each designed to meet
distinct consumer needs and cater for certain price sensitivities, thereby catering to various social demographic
needs. We believe that such categorization simplifies consumer decision-making and helps us strategically
position each tier to appeal to a different array of consumers.

**_Well-invested end-to-end platform_**

We operate an end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform, in which we have made
significant investment in recent years, and through which we produce and sell our products to retail and
foodservice partners in over 100 countries globally. We operate a global network of manufacturing facilities and
regional cold chain distribution centers with capabilities to support growth. Our historic strong cash generation
has enabled us to invest significantly in our global operations, ensuring we have the latest manufacturing
innovations at our disposal. We own a total of 14 manufacturing facilities, comprising seven in Europe, four in
the Americas and three in AMEA. These facilities produced approximately 91% of our total production volume
for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our comprehensive manufacturing network with a globally scaled and
digitally-enabled supply chain, is well positioned for future growth. Our end-to-end platform is supported by our
general ERP system and our SAP4Hana ERP system, which enable us to make data-driven operational decisions.

Our robust in-house manufacturing capabilities allow for complete control and flexibility in the
manufacturing process, through which we can (i) maintain a closer level of control over our robust quality and
safety standards, (ii) better establish and control cost savings, (iii) limit and control manufacturing disruptions,
(iv) reduce our carbon footprint and (v) manage the manufacturing process more efficiently.

Our products and customers further benefit from our internal centralized procurement function designed
to leverage our purchasing expertise and maximize scale efficiencies across the regions where we operate. Our
procurement function has a deep understanding of commodity cycles and risk management, and many years of
experience in the oils market. See “Business—Procurement” for a detailed description of our procurement
function.

**_An industry leading R&D expertise delivering innovation and driving conversion to plant-based food_**

Our strong innovation pipeline underpins our mission to revolutionize the plant-based ecosystem by
delivering tastier, high-quality products with natural ingredients. That pipeline is driven by our investment in
R&D, oils & fats and plant-based proteins amongst other enabling technologies, with food science at its core. We
believe that we have an industry leading R&D expertise that enables us to produce new and innovative products
using key ingredient know-how, technically sophisticated equipment and processes across our core categories and
products. As an insights-driven organization we seek to continually enhance consumer experience with respect to
taste, functionality, health and nutrition, sustainability and affordability by developing relevant product and
packaging innovation.

We continuously invest in food innovation and food technology expertise from our new state-of-the-art
food science centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands (“Food Science Centre”), which we have developed with an
investment capital of approximately €38 million. Our Food Science Centre focuses on plant-based food innovation
and it aims to pioneer the development of plant-based foods, enabling technologies including oils and fats as well
as proteins, and sustainable packaging solutions. Our team of more than 150 food scientists, food and packaging
technologists and specialists focus on the development of plant-based foods and sustainable packaging solutions.
We are also a leading filer of plant-based patents, and hold 656 patents and patent applications. In 2023, we
applied for a further ten patents across our categories and core technologies.

With our deep expertise in plant-based and natural ingredients and proprietary knowledge of plant-based
food manufacturing, we have implemented a significant product portfolio overhaul since 2018, focused on taste,

3


-----

clean label and naturalness, where possible. For instance, we developed our first-generation Plant Butter product
between 2018 and 2020, which we have since then further evolved, offering products we aim to achieve taste
parity as compared to dairy butter. We have also developed new recipes and ingredients for our products, for
example to provide consumers with palm oil-free options through our patented technology. In 2023, we
successfully launched our paper tub packaging technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand, with similar
launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in early 2024. Our R&D and innovation roadmap is centered
on continuous improvement and innovation within our core categories, to attract more and more consumers and
broaden the appeal of our products. Key areas of focus include further improving our Plant Cheese product range,
in particular in cold applications to further improve our Plant Cheese offering and applying some of our developing
technology to further improve our Plant Butters and Plant Creams products. In addition, we continue to develop
our packaging technology to create sustainable packaging and achieve our goal to reduce the environmental impact
of our packaging through reduced plastic usage and increased recyclability of our packaging. As well as innovating
internally to achieve these goals, we partner with academia, established ingredients and packaging players, startups and scale-ups whose differentiated propositions we believe can complement our R&D capabilities and our
ability to scale through our distribution channels, platform and growth levers.

**_Growth levers underpinned by a resilient, attractive financial profile with high cash generation_**

Our growth levers are centered around driving conversion from dairy products to our plant-based
products and involve:

    - Creating the best-ever products made by us: delivering tastier, high-quality products with natural
ingredients in our four core categories, underpinned by a strong innovation pipeline;

    - Deploying our power brands: leveraging our iconic power brands, recognized and trusted across
markets, with clear propositions;

    - Executing in multiple channels: reaching as many people as possible by executing well within our
channels: retail and foodservice; and

    - Driving and leveraging our scale: leveraging our digitally enabled end-to-end platform and scale.

Our transformation journey since 2018 has taken place against a turbulent and volatile backdrop of events
including a global pandemic, associated supply chain challenges, commodity inflation and the ongoing cost-ofliving crisis. However, during this period, by leveraging our growth levers, we have demonstrated a track record
of stable financial performance, in particular delivered strong growth in organic net sales, gross profit and
Normalized EBITDA. Between the year ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024,
our reported net sales increased at a CAGR of 6.4%, our gross profit increased at a CAGR of 11.4% and our
Normalized EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 12.1%.

We have also demonstrated strong cash generation, and generated a normalized free cash flow and
normalized free cash conversion ratio of €702 million and 81.4%, respectively, in each case, for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2024. We believe this compares favorably with our peers and is supported by, among other
things:

    - our flexible cost base, which allows for a sustainable gross margin. We have clear, consistent and
well-established supply chain, and hedging policies with respect to our major inputs and foreign
exchange exposures, which has allowed us to maintain strong levels of profitability in periods of
fluctuations and under high inflationary conditions;

    - our sustained profitability, with a Normalized EBITDA margin of 23.8%, 22.2%, 25.4% and 26.9%,
in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and the twelve months ended March 31,
2024, respectively, largely attributable to our flexible cost structure, our powerful brands, our
revenue growth management capabilities and our track record of operational cost savings;

    - a favorable working capital position, as we benefit from a negative cash conversion cycle. This
largely is a structural feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and
finished product markets in which we operate and our operational efficiency with respect to our
inventory management; and

    - our comprehensive manufacturing network with a globally scaled and digitally-enabled supply
chain and significant spare capacity. This allows for increased net sales volumes without
incremental capital expenditure resulting in strong cash generation.

Our strong cash generation and resulting Normalized EBITDA growth has helped us to progressively
deleverage. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and for the twelve months ended March 31,
2024, our historical leverage ratio was 8.4x, 7.2x, 6.5x and 6.5x, respectively. Our historical leverage ratio
represents the ratio of our (i) net debt, which is defined as our financial liabilities gross of unamortized financing
fees less cash and cash equivalents, excluding lease liabilities and derivative financial instruments to (ii)
Normalized EBITDA.

**Strategies**

Our strategies are focused on the continued implementation of our growth levers to capture the key
opportunities across our core categories and markets. Our clear mission and purpose forms the cornerstone of our
strategy to deliver long term sustainable, profitable and purposeful growth by bringing tasty plant-based foods to
people all over the world, and achieve our purpose “to make people healthier and happier with nutritious and
delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and for our planet.”

**_Our growth levers_**

_Creating the best-ever products made by us: delivering tastier, high-quality products with natural ingredients in_
_our four core categories, underpinned by a strong innovation pipeline_

Since 2018, we have reinvented our product portfolio, investing significant resources to create the bestever products made by us, including by harmonizing and simplifying our ingredients list and moving towards
fewer, natural and fully plant-based ingredients. We are focused on delivering our best-ever products that are
designed to have the same or superior taste, versatility and performance (cooking, baking, and spreading) as dairy
products. We believe that there should be no compromise for consumers when they change to a plant-based butter
or spread, liquid, plant-based cream or plant-based cheese, as compared to dairy alternatives. For example, our
Plant Butter is specifically formulated with the aim to match the performance and taste of dairy butter. Based on
more than 50 taste profiles, we created a series of plant butters which we strive to taste and perform just like dairy
butter and that match the specific taste preferences of different consumer profiles in key markets. Also, our knowhow and expertise of natural ingredients has enabled us to simplify our Plant Butter to contain just six or seven
natural ingredients (including certain Plant Oils, water, plant protein and, in some cases, salt) and enable
consumers to swap it directly for dairy butter in any recipe.

Consumers are also increasingly focused on clean label and naturalness, and 99% of all our ingredients
by volume are natural in origin. We continue to invest in R&D to deliver products using recipes made from natural
ingredients or products that are free from artificial colors, flavors and preservatives, and without compromising
on food safety, quality and performance. In addition, as part of our commitment to be 100% plant-based by the
end of 2030, we are continuously reviewing our use of dairy ingredients where there is no compromise in taste or
performance.

Aside from taste and performance, we focus on the nutritional benefits of our products, as well as their
positive contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and a key reason why people choose our
products. In 2022, our team of nutritionists and product developers created the Upfield nutritional benchmarking
program, based on what science tells us is required for each different product proposition and which introduced
saturated fat and trans-fat targets for plant creams and plant cheeses. This helps us ensure that we meet nutritional
targets in our products and are aligned with international dietary guidelines and regulations. Our plant-based
products contain zero trans-fats and lower saturated fats compared to dairy alternatives.

So, whether consumers are looking for a product to bake a cake, help lower their cholesterol or containing
the nutrients to support a growing family, our products strive to provide a “no compromise” choice, that is better
for consumers and better for the planet.

_Deploying our power brands: leveraging our iconic power brands, recognized, trusted and loved over the world_
_with clear propositions_

Our business traces its origin and heritage back over 150 years and, as a result, many of our reinvigorated
iconic power brands, including BlueBand and Rama, have a brand heritage spanning over 100 years. Our power

5


-----

brands, including as an example, Flora, Country Crock, Becel +ProActiv, Rama, BlueBand and Violife, are trusted
in their key markets globally and are at the heart of our future growth strategy and success.

Our power brands are well-known and have a high brand awareness amongst consumers in our markets.
They represent the platform from which we have successfully launched our product innovations and portfolio
renovation. Through our power brands we engage with both loyal and new consumers, offering people a positive
choice, both as a plant-based alternative to dairy and also for less competitive brands and private label. Based on
independent brand research, many of our power brands are among the best-performing FMCG/packaged grocery
brands across our key markets in terms of brand awareness. We believe that the high score of our power brands
indicate that consumers are more likely to choose our brands over others, which is a strong indicator of increasing
brand influence and share. To further support our power brands, we complemented the ongoing innovation across
our portfolio with an increase in strategic advertising and promotion investment. For the year ended December
31, 2023, our advertising and promotion expenses amounted to €173 million (equalling 5.3% of our net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2023 and an increase of 22.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022).
For example, in 2023, we launched our “Skip the Cow” campaign aimed at informing and driving consumers
towards more plant-based products. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign pushed the uptake of Flora Plant and has
proved to be a valuable resource in boosting consumer awareness of our Plant Butter offering and also contributed
to a strong positive consumer net sentiment of 86% towards our overall Flora brand. Furthermore, following the
“Skip the Cow” campaign, Flora Plant Butter experienced growth in household penetration and share of segment
in the United Kingdom. Following the success of the “Skip the Cow” campaign in the United Kingdom, we
launched similar campaigns across European markets, such as Germany and Austria, and intend to also roll it out
to other key markets such as the Netherlands, Poland or Spain, and also across other brands. To further leverage
the strength of our brands, we have from time to time considered, and continue to consider and evaluate,
modifications to our corporate branding and identity to more closely align with our key brands.

_Executing in multiple channels: reaching as many people as possible through our channels: retail and foodservice_

We also differentiate ourselves through our retail and professional foodservice channels, which enable
us to reach consumers directly through both industry channels. We sell our products to retail outlets, including to
many of the world’s largest retailers, as well as to wholesalers. We also enhanced our e-commerce capabilities by
developing relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco, Amazon
and Carrefour online, which have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe
represent a significant growth opportunity in the regions in which we operate, especially in Europe and the
Americas. In addition, in emerging markets in which we operate across our regions, we have established a strong
market channel based on deep relationships with well-known and reputable distributors. Through our foodservice
channel, we also supply the professional channel, including restaurants, hotels and industrial kitchens. This multichannel approach gives us access to a broad and diverse customer base, which enhances our position as a leader
in many of our core categories. Because of our strong relationships with leading global and regional retailers, we
operate as the supplier of choice and/or “category captain” for certain strategic retailers, providing in-depth
knowledge and consumer insight for particular product categories to our retailer customers.

Moreover, we believe there is considerable potential to introduce and expand our core product categories
in the foodservice channel given our current portfolio’s appeal across high-end clients who lead and influence the
menu adoption cycle to large quick-service restaurants, bakery chains and other national accounts where mass
adoption occurs. Our growth strategy in foodservice is focused on selling value-added branded products with
high-demand applications to commercial customers and driving customer acquisition through our chef-led sales
approach (see also “—Sales and Marketing”).

_Driving and leveraging our scale: leveraging our digitally enabled end-to-end platform and scale_

Through our end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform we produce and sell our products
to retail and foodservice partners in over 100 countries globally. Our global footprint, scale and expertise along
the value chain allow us to leverage efficiencies through which we can derive significant advantages compared to
other plant-based competitors and dairy players. Since 2018, we have demonstrated a track record in driving
efficiencies for example by establishing product portfolio efficiencies (through the retirement of SKUs that are
less profitable or of low productivity and the simplification of our recipes), procurement efficiencies (by sourcing
most of our ingredients and packaging materials from global suppliers who can deliver locally), supply chain
efficiencies (through our established local retail and distribution network) and by maintaining a continued focus
on operational efficiencies in line with our value creation program. Establishing such efficiencies allows us to
offer affordable products.

**_Continuously delivering our Purpose_**

Our purpose is “to make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based
food that is good for you and for our planet” and it shapes how we approach the sourcing of our ingredients, the
development of our recipes, our relationships with retailers and how we communicate with consumers. We intend
to continue fulfilling our purpose with our commitment and initiatives across our four pillars: (i) plant-based, (ii)
healthier lives, (iii) happier people and (iv) better planet, which are at the heart of our business with tangible
programs and milestones.

_Plant-Based_

Actively helping the food transition and building a better, plant-based future is at the heart of what we
do. Our plant-based commitment pillar seeks to help inspire and encourage consumers to switch from dairy to
plant-based options. As we continue to improve our product portfolio, we aim to reach one billion consumers with
our products by 2030. We believe we can achieve that goal by offering consumers a range of products that meet
their needs, which also includes making sure our products taste great, perform well, and are made with simple,
natural ingredients.

We believe we are in a strong position to support the transition to a plant-based diet by offering tasty,
affordable, nutritious and more sustainable products. From our Food Science Centre, we continuously invest in
high performance product formulations and reformulations to keep up with consumer needs and trends. For
example, in 2023, we launched the Violife cream cheese block in the United States which has been developed
specifically to compete with leading dairy cream cheeses on the market, following a completely new formulation
and format.

To spread awareness around our plant-based products, we frequently launch retail consumer advertising
campaigns with slogans aimed at informing and driving consumers and professionals towards more plant-based
products. Other efforts to boost our brands’ and products’ visibility include, for example, sponsorship of sporting
events and partnerships with celebrities and influencers.

In addition, we are also working to support the industry moving forward in terms of plant-based
innovation, which includes establishing standard parameters for plant-based products. For example, we are
currently leading the development of a new ISO standard that we expect will specify technical definitions of, and
criteria for, plant-based foods. We believe that this new ISO standard will help align the global food industry
around a single terminology approach.

_Healthier Lives_

The second pillar focuses on the nutritional benefits of our products as well as their positive contribution
to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and we believe is a key reason why people choose our products.
We aim for our products to outperform their dairy counterparts with respect to levels of saturated and trans-fats.
We take a science-based approach to establishing criteria and targets for each product type we sell, considering
who uses them, how frequently and in which applications. These targets are based on recognized external
international standards and official dietary recommendations, including those from the World Health
Organization. Moreover, we have set additional targets that ensure we can deliver the desired nutritional
composition. These include considerations on how we can limit nutrients of concern and provide essential
nutrients that target some of the greatest public health areas of concern, such as heart health and children’s growth
and development. Our brands BlueBand and Becel +ProActiv are our global brands focused on positively
impacting lives across the world by offering healthy, affordable and nutritious options. In 2023, approximately
30% of our net sales came from products providing health and nutrition benefits and that can be labelled as such,
in compliance with regulation.

Additionally, we believe the future of food lies in quality, responsibly made, plant-based foods. To realize
this future and provide consumers with healthier options, we intend to continue implementing rigorous quality
and safety standards at both our and third-party facilities, including for product design, formulation, raw material
sourcing, packing, manufacturing, storage, transport, display, marketing, communication, sales and product
disposal. Moreover, we intend to continue ensuring that our products are accessible to as many people as possible,
which includes ensuring our products come in at affordable price points. In this regard we intend to maintain a
portfolio of products designed for budgetary brackets across the market spectrum and which are more affordable
than dairy alternatives, without compromising on quality.

_Happier People_

We believe that people are happier when they are engaged and we actively promote a culture of active support.
We are committed to our community of dedicated “Upfielders.” Our approach to employee engagement is driven
by three core values: performance, care and passion. To nurture an engaged workforce, we complete an annual
survey to gauge employee sentiment and opportunities for progress. In addition, diverse businesses are likely to
be more successful and we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive working environment. Across our
supply chains, we are connected to thousands of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs who grow our ingredients
and chefs who create and prepare millions of meals every day. In support of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs,
we maintain several partnerships, enabling and encouraging them to improve agricultural practices and access to
markets.

In addition, we seek to reach as many chefs and food service professionals as possible to encourage the
adoption of our products into their cooking, thereby engaging chefs in the plant-based revolution. We do this by,
for example, hosting cooking workshops for chefs or participating in trade fairs where we can reach out and
educate professionals on the advantages of plant-based cooking.

_Better Planet_

With an environmental footprint significantly smaller than that of dairy products, our products can help
consumers reduce their impact, and we ensure our operations do so as well. We are committed to responsibly
sourcing ingredients, developing sustainable packaging and addressing our carbon emissions to enhance
sustainability.

Our better planet commitments include our environmental targets to address our material environmental
impacts on the climate, on packaging and on responsible sourcing. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we
committed to Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”) and have worked on redefining our targets in line with the
newly published Forest, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) guidance to align with limiting global warming to 1.5
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In this respect, we are making multiple efforts towards reducing our
emissions and reducing environmental impact through waste and water management at our manufacturing
facilities. In addition, we are committed to providing packaging that protects products and the planet. We delivered
a milestone packaging achievement with the launch of the world’s first paper-based tub for plant-based butters
and spreads, our Flora Plant paper tub at the end of 2023, starting our journey towards our target of reducing
plastic across our portfolio by 80% by 2030 (compared to a 2020 baseline). In addition, we are committed to
responsible and sustainable sourcing of our ingredients (including our Plant Oils) and packaging materials
(including paper and pulp) and our “Responsible Sourcing Policy” and “Business Partner Code of Conduct”
applies to all our suppliers. Where key ingredients are identified as potentially high risk, we maintain strong
individual policies designed to address the potential risks inherent in these supply chains, particularly focussing
on deforestation and exploitation. See also “Business— Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”).”

                 - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the
relevant Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not
secure the Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such debt;

                 - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future debt of
subsidiaries of the relevant Guarantor, other than the Company, that
do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including obligations
to trade creditors; and

                 - be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, including the
limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—_
_The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations._

**Security ..........................................** Pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, Permitted Collateral Liens
and certain perfection requirements, on the Issue Date, the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking
basis by English law and New York law governed security interests over
certain material assets of the Guarantors incorporated in England &
Wales and Delaware, including (i) material operating bank accounts of
such Guarantors, (ii) material structural intercompany receivables
owing to such Guarantors and (iii) shares or capital stock (or partnership
interests, as applicable) held in respect of such Guarantors,
(collectively, the “Initial Collateral”).

In addition, pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, Permitted
Collateral Liens and certain perfection requirements, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and in any event within 10
days from the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees
will be secured on a subsequent-ranking basis (in each case treated as
first ranking in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement) by:

                   - Dutch law governed security interests over certain (i) material
operating bank accounts of the Issuer and the Guarantors
incorporated in the Netherlands, (ii) material structural
intercompany receivables owing to Guarantors incorporated in
the Netherlands and (iii) shares or capital stock (or partnership
interests, as applicable) held in respect of the Issuer and the
Subsidiary Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands,

                   - German law governed security interests over certain (i)
material operating bank accounts of the Guarantors
incorporated in Germany and (ii) shares or capital stock (or

14


-----

partnership interests, as applicable) held in respect of such
Guarantors; and

(collectively, the “ **Additional Collateral,” together with the Initial**
Collateral, and any and all assets from time to time in which a security
interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document
to secure the obligations under the Indenture or the Senior Secured
Notes or any Guarantee, in each case, as may be in existence from time
to time, the “Collateral”). See also “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Security—Collateral.”_

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement and hedging agreements on a pari passu basis and
may secure additional Indebtedness permitted to be secured on the
Collateral. In addition, a portion of the Collateral, as further described
under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Collateral”
(the “Shared Collateral”) also secures, on a senior subordinated basis,
the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Notes.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of
obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any
hedging obligations and certain future Indebtedness secured on the
Collateral will rank pari passu with the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement
action over any Collateral. In addition, the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, hedging
obligations and such permitted or other future senior secured
Indebtedness will receive priority over the Senior Notes with respect to
any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Shared
Collateral, which secures the Senior Notes, on a senior subordinated
basis, and also forms part of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes.

The Collateral will, in each case, be limited and subject to certain
statutory defenses under the laws of the Netherlands, England and
Wales, Germany and New York, as applicable, as described under “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the security interests in the_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may_
_be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit their validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_
_insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The security interests over the Collateral may be released under certain
circumstances. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

**Additional Amounts .....................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes will be made without withholding or deduction
for or on account of taxes unless required by law. If the Issuer or
Guarantors are required by law to withhold or deduct amounts for or on
account of tax imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as
defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding
_Taxes”) with respect to a payment to the holders of Senior Secured_
Notes, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will, subject to certain
exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount
received by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes after the
withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they would
have received in the absence of the withholding or deduction. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**Optional Redemption ...................** At any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem at its option
all or part of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed,
plus the applicable “make-whole” premium as described in this
Offering Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the redemption date.

At any time on or after       , 2026, the Issuer will be entitled at its
option to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at the
redemption prices set forth under the caption “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid interest_
to the redemption date, if any.

At any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer will be entitled at its
option, on one or more occasions, to redeem the Senior Secured Notes
in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including additional
Senior Secured Notes, if any) with the net cash proceeds from certain
equity offerings at a redemption price equal to        % of the
principal amount outstanding in respect of the Senior Secured Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any, so long
as each such redemption occurs within 180 days after the date of the
relevant equity offering and provided that at least 50% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (not including
any additional Senior Secured Notes) remains outstanding after the
redemption.

At any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may, during each twelve
month period commencing on the Issue Date, redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (calculated
after giving effect to the issuance of any additional Senior Secured
Notes) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

At any time following the occurrence of any Initial Public Offering, the
Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or
in part, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash
Proceeds of such Initial Public Offering received by the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary at a redemption price equal to 102% of the
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but
excluding) the redemption date.

**Optional Redemption for Tax**
**Reasons ..........................................** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may
redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time,
at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control ........................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control,
the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the date of purchase. However, a change of control will not be
deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated leverage ratio is not
exceeded in connection with such event. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Change of Control.”_

**Certain Covenants ........................** The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the Company
and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

                 - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

                 - pay dividends or make other distributions or investments or
purchase or reduce or redeem the Issuer’s stock;

                 - make investments or other restricted payments;

                 - enter into agreements that restrict the Issuer’s restricted
subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

                 - transfer or sell assets;

                 - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                 - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

                 - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or
substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s assets.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions and
qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Use of Proceeds .............................** The Issuer will use the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes as
set forth in “Use of Proceeds.”

**Transfer Restrictions ....................** The Issuer has not registered the Senior Secured Notes or the
Guarantees under the U.S. Securities Act and has not agreed, or
otherwise undertaken, to do so. You may only offer or sell Senior
Secured Notes in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See “Notice to
_Investors.”_

**No Prior Market ...........................** The Senior Secured Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no market. Although the Initial Purchasers have informed us
that they intend to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes, they are
not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at any
time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid
market for the Senior Secured Notes will develop or be maintained.

Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of the Senior
Secured Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following tables summarize the Company’s historical consolidated financial information as of the_
_dates and for the periods indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the historical and other consolidated financial_
_information presented below have been derived from (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the_
_Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, which have been prepared in_
_accordance with IFRS, as well as with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and (ii)_
_the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as of and for the three months_
_ended March 31, 2024, which contains unaudited comparative information for the three months ended March 31,_
_2023, and which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the_
_European Union, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_We have also presented below certain unaudited consolidated income statement information and certain_
_other consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Such information for the_
_twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has been derived by adding the relevant item for the year ended December_
_31, 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and subtracting the relevant item for the three months_
_ended March 31, 2023._

_We also present certain non-IFRS measures below that we use to evaluate our operating and financial_
_performance. Such non-IFRS measures include, among others, certain organic and constant currency growth_
_metrics that we use, including, organic net sales growth/(decrease), constant currency net sales growth, constant_
_currency gross profit (decrease)/growth, constant currency gross margin (decrease)/growth, constant currency_
_Normalized EBITDA growth and constant currency Normalized EBITDA margin (decrease)/growth, and other_
_non-IFRS measures, such as Normalized EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA margin, normalized free cash flow,_
_normalized free cash conversion ratio, pricing contribution and volume/mix contribution. These measures are not_
_identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to_
_evaluate our performance. In addition, we also present below certain unaudited consolidated financial_
_information of our Group, adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, as if they had occurred on March 31, 2024_
_for the consolidated statement of financial position data and on April 1, 2023 for the consolidated income_
_statement data, including the impact on our cash position, amount of debt and interest expense. See “Presentation_
_of Financial and Other Information.”_

_Any references in these tables to “we,” the “Group” or “Upfield” related to the Company and its_
_consolidated subsidiaries. Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the financial and other_
_information included in this section. As a result, figures shown as totals in some tables and charts may not be_
_exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them._

_This summary historical consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the_
_sections entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information,”_

(1) As we are a geographically diversified business with global operations, we undertake transactions in various currencies. As a result, a
number of our subsidiaries report their financial results in currencies other than the euro, which is the reporting currency of our
consolidated financial statements. So as to enhance comparability of some of key financial metrics, including net sales growth, gross
profit growth, gross margin growth, Normalized EBITDA growth and Normalized EBITDA margin growth, we present such metrics on
a constant currency basis. The exchange rates used for the calculation of such constant currency exchange rate metrics for a particular

21


-----

period represent the average exchange rates of the relevant currency for the prior period. By presenting such metrics on a constant
currency basis, we exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations such that both the current and prior period local currency values
are translated into euro using prior year average exchange rates. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non IFRS
_Financial Measures—Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures” for the exchange rates used by us to calculate constant currency_
exchange rate measures in respect of our principal currencies for the relevant periods. For each such period, the exchange rates mentioned
under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non IFRS Financial Measures—Constant Currency Exchange Rate
_Measures” represent the average exchange rates of the relevant currency for the prior period._

(2) Organic net sales growth/(decrease) presents a “like–for-like” comparative growth rate, and represents the change in net sales for the
current period compared to the comparable prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis and by eliminating any change in scope
between the relevant periods. Such change in scope between periods may result from: (i) an acquisition, divestiture or disposal of our
business in a country or a major market or that of a business unit; (ii) changes to the business model under which we operate in a specific
market, or with respect to the manner in which a particular product is (or particular products are) sold by us in that market (for example,
if we change our local operating model from a distributor model to a royalty model, or if we change from third-party manufacturing
(wherein such third-party manufacturer typically sources raw materials) to toll manufacturing (wherein we typically supply raw
materials to a third party manufacturer) or (iii) the adoption of an accounting standard or a change in the application of an accounting
principle, if applicable. We commenced calculating organic net sales growth/(decrease) beginning for the year ended December 31,
2023. Accordingly, we present organic net sales growth/(decrease) for the year ended December 31, 2023, the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 only. See also “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Our Results of Operation—Results of Operations” for a discussion on the reasons for the change_
in organic net sales growth/(decrease) and/or constant currency net sales growth (as described below), including in our operating
segments, for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum.

(3) Constant currency net sales growth presents the change in net sales for the relevant period compared to the prior period, calculated on a
constant currency basis. We present constant currency net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022
only.

(4) Represents the growth rate of our reported gross profit (which is our net sales minus cost of sales) calculated on a constant currency
basis.

(5) Represents our reported gross margin (calculated as our net sales minus cost of sales divided by net sales, and expressed as a percentage).

(6) Represents the growth rate of our reported gross margin calculated on a constant currency basis.

(7) Normalized EBITDA is a non-IFRS metric which is defined as net profit/(loss) before income tax expense, net finance costs,
depreciation of property, plant and equipment (including right of use assets) and amortization of intangible assets, as adjusted for sharebased payment expenses and certain non-underlying items that we do not consider to be part of the Group’s daily business operations,
due to the nature, frequency, and predictability of their occurrence. While the amounts included in Normalized EBITDA have been
derived from our consolidated financial statements or management accounts, they are not financial measures calculated in accordance
with IFRS. Accordingly, they should not be considered as alternatives to net profit/(loss) or operating profit/(loss) as indicators of our
performance, or as alternatives to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. Our management uses Normalized EBITDA to
assess our operating performance. In addition, we believe that Normalized EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors.
Normalized EBITDA, as presented in this Offering Memorandum, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of reported net
profit/(loss) to Normalized EBITDA:

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,_
_including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_Fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials, as well as increases of supply chain costs, may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

The principal ingredient in our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses are refined
Plant Oils. Aside from Plant Oils, additional key inputs used in our production process include other natural ingredients,
packaging materials and utility inputs such as water and energy. We obtain substantially all of our raw materials from
third-party suppliers, with cost of such materials (which includes Plant Oils, other ingredients, flavors, finished goods
from third-party manufacturers and packaging materials) representing 67% and 68% of our total cost of sales, for the year
ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively.

The availability and cost of Plant Oils and other ingredients used in our products can fluctuate substantially over
relatively short periods of time due to a number of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions,
agricultural policies, government programs, weather conditions such as frosts, drought and floods, and plant diseases,
pests and other acts of nature. In particular, price volatility has increased since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as
well as due to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. For example, although we do
not source sunflower oil from Ukraine directly, as Ukraine is the world’s biggest exporter of sunflower oil, beginning the
first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the war in Ukraine caused a global shortage of sunflower oil, which
in turn led to a rise in the price of sunflower oil during the year ended December 31, 2022. Although, in response to
possible disruptions in the supply chain, we created a formula that allows us to substitute and swap ingredients within our
Butters and Spreads (such as sunflower oil for rapeseed oil), without any impact on the taste, texture or functionality of
our products, such substitution of our recipes to prevent any supply chain disruptions may result in a higher cost base as
this generally results in incremental R&D costs and a need to adjust packaging. The increase in sunflower oil prices has
also had a knock-on effect on the prices of other Plant Oils, including palm, rapeseed and soybean oil, which have seen a
further spike in demand as a result of their growing use as biofuel. The price of palm oil has also increased in recent years
due to slower production by the main producer nations, and the recently adopted domestic market obligation policy in
Indonesia, which is the world’s largest palm oil producer. Pursuant to this policy, palm oil producers in Indonesia had to
set aside a certain quantity of palm oil for local buyers, thereby limiting the amount available for export. In addition, the
increase in inflation globally since 2022 has further increased our costs of acquiring ingredients and the contributed to
general volatility of commodity prices, and this inflationary impact continues. We may not be able to preserve our gross
profit margin if such volatility, fluctuations and high inflationary conditions were to persist, as we may have limited
ability to flow through our increased commodity cost in our pricing, which in turn could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The past years’ significant volatility in commodity prices, the significant surge in energy and transportation
prices, as well as the supply chain interruptions caused by recent geopolitical and economic events, adversely impacted
our inputs suppliers’ cost base which they subsequently passed on to us. For example, because of the energy intensive
nature of the refinery process to turn crude oils into refined oils, our Plant Oils suppliers have sought to pass on their
heightened energy costs to us. All of this has exposed us in turn to significantly higher Plant Oils, packaging, energy
costs, and as a consequence thereof, higher manufacturing, logistics and transportation costs, which we may not be able

25


-----

to effectively hedge or fully pass on to our customers. There can be no assurance that we or our third-party manufacturers
will be able to obtain alternative sources of raw materials or packaging materials at reasonable prices, or at all, should
there be shortages or other unfavorable conditions.

To manage our input costs, we regularly monitor global market prices and enter into hedging arrangements,
principally in respect of the major Plant Oils we purchase as well as utilities. We use a combination of fixed contracts and
commodity derivatives (futures, over the counter and tradable forward contracts) to hedge against commodity price risk.
Our policy is to hedge the majority of the risk within the relevant pricing window, and typically on a three to six months
rolling basis. However, there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will successfully reduce our exposure to
price volatility in the long term and, given our limited customer negotiation windows, there may be a time lag between
the implementation of our pricing initiatives and the impact of inflation across our key inputs.

Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products or other supply chain inputs at
reasonable prices, or at all, as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could cause an increase in our cost
of sales and a corresponding decrease in our gross profit margin, or cause our net sales to fluctuate from period to
period. Such fluctuations may result in a decrease in gross profit margin and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in food trends and consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Trends within our industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends
could, among other things, lead to reduced demand and price reductions and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

There are a number of changing consumer trends, demands and preferences which have an effect on both our
Group and the industry in which we operate. These include dietary, health and environmental concerns and trends, such
as increasing awareness of different nutritional aspects of foods and the health effects and sourcing practices relating to
specific ingredients, an increasing preference for dairy-free, vegan and organic food ingredients, trends towards eating
outside of home and concerns regarding public health consequences associates with obesity and increasing awareness of
the environmental and social effects of production (in particular those related to palm oil, which is a key ingredient in
many products across our portfolio). Currently, there is an increasing trend of consumers across markets preferring nondairy, plant-based products as a result of the increasing awareness of lactose-intolerance health issues, high carbon
footprint and the environmental impact of dairy consumption. However, this growing trend towards plant-based
alternatives may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, such as misconceptions about “highly processed” plantbased foods, perceived “naturalness” of dairy and increased regulatory control of the plant-based sector. In addition, there
has been negative press coverage in recent years as regards products made from palm oil due to both health and
environmental concerns. For example, among our key markets, Spain and the Netherlands in particular, have seen a
greater negative press coverage and perception as regards use of palm oil based products. In response thereto, we created
a patented palm oil-free technology and we have shifted our focus on offering alternatives to palm oil in some of our
markets. Although we source certified (segregated and mass balance) palm oil and offer palm oil-free options in several
markets, there is a risk that additional press coverage and the resulting negative consumer perception of products made
from palm oil further escalates. Although we recognize the controversy around palm oil as an ingredient and continue to
innovate and create new recipes both with sustainable palm oil and alternatives to palm oil through our patented palm oilfree technology, some of our products contain palm oil and switching to exclusively palm oil-free products may not be
currently technically feasible.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the conflict in the
Middle East, the global markets and economy have experienced significant uncertainty. There has been a sharp rise in
energy and food costs, resulting in inflationary macroeconomic conditions across most major economies and markets
where we operate. Given these economic conditions, there has been a significant decline in disposable incomes of many
households, creating a cost of living crisis, that has altered the purchasing habits of consumers. In these circumstances,
consumers may choose to economize by purchasing non-branded or private–label brands, which may be cheaper than
our products. A reduction in consumer disposable income could foster a move by our customers towards discounters
and non-branded products, which would impact our market share and adversely affect our net sales. For example, during
the year ended December 31, 2023, there has been a slowdown in the growth of our Plant Cheeses driven by the cost-ofliving crisis, higher prices and increased competition in certain key markets, especially in the United Kingdom. The plant
cheese segment is a strategic segment for us and we intend to launch a variety of new plant cheese products and continue
to further improve the nutritional value and taste of our Plant Cheeses. However, any decrease in demand could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

26


-----

Our success will be impacted by our ability to anticipate and identify consumer trends and preferences, and to
offer a portfolio of relevant products that appeal to consumer needs and preferences on a timely and affordable basis.
In doing so, we may also be required to leverage our research and development capabilities, and to utilize management’s
ability to launch new or improved products quickly, successfully and on a cost-effective basis. A decrease in demand for
our products due to a shift in consumer tastes or preferences to which we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Economic and political instability and/or unfavorable economic and political conditions may have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our results of operations._**

Our business may be negatively affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general
macroeconomic conditions, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, geopolitical events, a public health crisis
and other general political and economic developments globally and in the markets in which we operate. The years ended
December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 were characterized by macroeconomic, geopolitical and supply chain issues on a
global scale, due in part to political turmoil or upheaval in a number of regions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite an
improvement in global economic conditions in 2021 and 2022 following the sharp global economic downturn in 2020
resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, the outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain,
and certain of our key markets, including Europe and the United States, may not achieve the growth rates that they have
forecasted or historically observed.

Such uncertainty has been exacerbated by the global turmoil resulting from the ongoing war in Ukraine, which
resulted in severe sanctions being imposed on Russia (including certain Russian entities and individuals). Examples of
such sanctions include a prohibition on doing business with certain Russian companies, large financial institutions,
officials and oligarchs and a commitment by certain countries and the European Union to remove selected Russian banks
from SWIFT, the electronic banking network that connects banks globally. The ongoing war in Ukraine has been a driver
behind severe market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, volatility in credit and capital
markets, a significant surge in energy and transportation prices, as well as supply chain interruptions, which all have been,
and may continue to be, key factors in driving inflationary pressure and which may ultimately adversely affect general
economic conditions. Commodities and energy are the two key elements in our input cost base. Therefore, any fluctuation
and volatility can have an material adverse impact on our gross profit margin. We shut down our operations in Russia in
the first quarter of 2022 before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine due to strategic reasons. In 2022, we experienced minor
supply chain disruptions for sunflower oil due to the war in Ukraine. In addition, tensions between China and Taiwan and
the conflict in the Middle East have further enhanced the unstable geopolitical environment globally, and particularly in
AMEA. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, none of our suppliers are based in Russia or Ukraine. However,
further intensification of those geopolitical conflicts or its spread to other parts of the world, including certain parts of
Europe, the Americas or other parts of AMEA, could cause supply chain and logistic disruptions and financial market
volatility globally. Moreover, market uncertainty and volatility have also been magnified, and may continue to be
impacted by, the upcoming 2024 United States presidential and congressional elections, resulting in uncertainties
regarding actual and potential shifts in the United States and foreign trade and economic policies.

In addition, general elections in numerous EU countries could lead to the exit of one or more other countries
from the eurozone or other potential developments, which could be an additional source of instability in international
markets. Further, some EU Member States within the eurozone could decide to discontinue their use of the euro as their
functional currency. The exit of another country from the EU, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to this could
result in significant macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, decreases in global stock exchange
indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a further weakening of the pound sterling and euro against
other leading currencies), and decreased GDP in the European Union. Any of these events or market perceptions
concerning these and related issues, could undermine confidence in the overall stability of the EU, have adverse
consequences for us with respect to our overall performance in the European Union.

For example, after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU on January 31, 2020, the EU treaties
ceased to apply to the United Kingdom. Following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, there were
changes in the legal rights and obligations among commercial parties in the United Kingdom and the EU, including
(among others) financial institutions, suppliers and service providers and their respective customers. In addition, there
were changes in import, tax and employment laws and regulations after the end of the transition period, resulting in an
increase in the cost of importing goods from EU countries and adversely affecting our and our contractors’ and supplier’s
ability in the United Kingdom to retain and recruit employees from the wider European labor market, leading to labor
shortages and higher costs. Additionally, the rate of exchange of the pound sterling vis-à-vis other currencies has been
very volatile since the Brexit referendum.

27


-----

Any of the foregoing events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_An inability to pass on price increases for raw materials or other inputs to our customers may have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our results of operations._**

Our ability to pass through increases in the prices of raw materials and other inputs, such as packaging
materials and energy costs, to our customers depends, among others, on prevailing competitive conditions and pricing
methods in the markets in which we operate, and we may not be able to pass through such price increases to our customers.
For example, we took significant pricing actions in 2021 and 2022 to pass price increases to our customers. However, we
may not always be successful in passing price increases to our customers or the actions we take may not be sufficient.
Moreover, following price increases implemented by us in 2021 and 2022, we may face pressure from our customers to
reduce pricing from current levels. Such demands could potentially strain our profit margins and necessitate strategic
adjustments in pricing strategies to maintain our competitive position in the market. Even if we are able to pass through
price increases, there is typically a time lag between cost increases affecting our business and the implementation of
product price increases, which are ultimately within the discretion of the retailer, during which time our gross profit
margin may be reduced. A time lag in the recovery of cost inflation, driven by either cost increases in raw materials or
changes in the foreign exchange rate of the currency the raw material is denominated in, can also negatively impact
our margins. In addition, during negotiations to increase prices to recover cost increases in raw materials, retailers may
take actions, which exacerbate the impact of such cost increases. Our inability to pass through price increases in raw
materials and other inputs and preserve our profit margins in the future could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We operate in a highly competitive market and our failure to compete may have a material adverse effect on our results_**
**_of operations._**

The categories and markets that we operate in are highly competitive globally, particularly in Europe and the
United States, which account for the majority of our net sales. Our competitors include well-established branded
producers that operate on both a national and an international basis across single or multiple dairy and non-dairy
categories as well as retailers who promote private label products within these categories. Our competitors generally
compete with us on the basis of price and promotional strategy, actual or perceived quality, health benefits and
“naturalness” of products, brand recognition, consumer loyalty, product variety, new product development and
improvements to existing products. In addition, we may face increased competition from new entrants in the markets
in which we operate.

We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or their effect on consumer perceptions
or the success and timing of our own advertising and promotional efforts. For example, during 2023, we saw strong
competition in the Netherlands, Germany and Poland which was largely pricing and promotionally driven and
contributed to a negative volume/mix contribution for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our competitors have
developed and launched products targeted to compete directly with our products. Our retail customers generally control
the shelf space allocations within their stores and may allocate more shelf space to generic or private label products or
to our branded competitors’ products in accordance with their respective promotional strategies. Decreases in shelf
space allocated to our products, increases in competitor promotional activity, aggressive marketing strategies by
competitors or other factors may require us to reduce our prices or invest greater amounts in advertising and promotion
of our products to ensure our products remain competitive. In addition, given recent economic uncertainty and conditions,
there has been a significant decline in disposable incomes of many households, creating a cost of living crisis, that has
altered the purchasing habits of consumers, and may adversely impact the price competitiveness of our products. See
also “—Changes in food trends and consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on our results of
_operations.”_

Furthermore, some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources
than those of ours in certain markets. This creates competitive pressures that could cause us to lose market share or require
us to lower prices, increase advertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns. These
competitive factors may also restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost
increases. Any inability to continue to respond effectively to these and other competitive pressures could negatively
impact our net sales and gross profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We believe that we have a major business opportunity by highlighting the lower climate impact of our products
(vs their dairy equivalents) as the global dairy and meat sectors face pressure on this point and will need to reduce carbon
emissions to meet future legal climate targets in multiple geographies. For example, in 2023, we launched our “Skip the

28


-----

Cow” campaign to inspire the shift to plant-based alternatives and promote the benefits of Flora Plant in the United
Kingdom, which directly competes with dairy butter and which has approximately 75% less climate impact than dairy
butter. However, there is a risk we will be unable to fully leverage this opportunity because of the lobbying we face from
the dairy and meat industries in certain markets. For example, the EU and the United Kingdom adopted restrictive labeling
rules and banned plant-based products including terms like “milk,” “not milk,” “alternative milk” on their packages.
While we have clear processes in place to refute certain pro dairy and meat proposals, we cannot guarantee that we will
be successful in doing so. In addition, in some markets we are subject to increased government scrutiny regarding
allegedly misleading packaging as well as complaints made by the dairy industry at advertising self-regulating entities.
Although we have been successful in refuting certain of these claims, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be
successful in doing so. Moreover, historically the dairy industry has successfully convinced many consumers that butter
products are more “natural” and hence healthier than plant-based dairy alternatives. This perception of naturalness
combined with certain customers’ taste preferences could enable dairy manufacturers to increase their market share
relative to ours and other manufacturers of butters and spreads.

Any of the foregoing events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we do not manage our supply chain adequately and effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected._**

The inability of our manufacturing facilities, as well as any supplier of raw materials, third-party manufacturer,
distributor or warehouse, to deliver or perform in an adequate and timely or cost-effective manner could cause our
operating costs to increase and our gross profit margins to decrease.

As we own a total of 14 manufacturing facilities across our operating regions, we are subject to the risks
associated with operating and maintaining our manufacturing facilities, as well as relying on third-party manufacturing
facilities. Our manufacturing facilities produced approximately 91% of our total production volume for the year ended
December 31, 2023, with the remaining sourced from third-party manufacturers. We are therefore subject to the risks
associated with operating, and must incur potentially significant capital and other expenditures necessary to maintain, our
manufacturing facilities, machinery and equipment. We must maintain our manufacturing facilities in order to, among
other things, keep up with demand for our products, retain sufficient capacity to manufacture new products and increase
our margins. If we are unable to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity to keep up with demand for our products
and ensure that our sales and production teams adequately coordinate their planning and production efforts, we risk losing
potential product sales.

We have relationships with multiple third-party manufacturing facilities, which produced approximately 10% of
our total production volume in 2023. We currently rely on and may continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to
produce our products in certain smaller volume or more emerging markets, which we would not be able to service
otherwise. For example, GrainCorp Foods Australia Pty Limited (“GrainCorp”) is the only manufacturer of our products
that are sold within Australia and New Zealand. If GrainCorp had a material issue or delay in their manufacturing process
or if our contract was terminated without finding a substitute manufacturer, our business may be adversely affected. Our
third-party manufacturers are required by us to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product
specifications and requirements for certain certifications. However, we have less control over third-party manufacturing
facilities when compared to directly owned facilities. As a result, the failure of any third-party manufacturer to produce
products that conform to our standards could materially and adversely affect our reputation and result in product recalls,
product liability claims and economic loss. We also face risks of competitive access to our intellectual property when
third-party manufacturers require access to our formulas and trade secrets as a condition to doing business with us.

Any loss of the use of all or a portion of our own or contracted third-party facilities due to accidents, fires,
explosions, labor issues, supply interruptions, transportation interruptions, human error, mechanical failure, terrorist
acts, power outages, discharges or releases of hazardous substances and other environmental issues, or otherwise,
whether short- or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Increased frequency or duration of
extreme weather conditions, natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms and earthquakes could also
damage our facilities, impair production capabilities, and disrupt our supply chain for commodities or packaging
materials, significantly impact the availability of our raw materials and the costs thereof, or impact demand for our
products. Our sole manufacturing plant in Kansas, United States, produces the substantial majority of all our products
sold in the United States and the vast majority of our global volumes of cream are produced at the Kleve manufacturing
facility in Germany. Our manufacturing facilities in Corlu, Turkey and Drama, Greece produce a substantial part of our
Plant Butter and Spreads and Plant Cheeses, respectively; they are, however, located in a seismic zone and therefore
subject to a significantly higher risk of negative impacts resulting from earthquakes in particular. Any loss of the use
of all or a portion of any of such key facilities could result in substantial business losses, production delays, third
29

party lawsuits and significant repair costs, as well as personal injury and/or loss of life, which could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, while we have insurance coverage in place, unexpected failures of our equipment and machinery
could result in production delays, turnover loss and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to our employees. In some
cases, manufacturing facilities are designated for certain types of products based on the unique equipment involved and
it is more difficult, or impossible, for us to shift production of these products among our facilities. Any interruption in
production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation and could require
significant lead time replacing, which could have a negative impact on our gross profit margin and cash flows. A loss
or interruption in production at certain of our facilities could disrupt our operations and affect a large number of
customers, decreasing our net sales. The operation of manufacturing facilities also requires us to hire, train and evaluate
large numbers of production employees, which involves additional labor and employment related risks and uncertainties.

We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to losses associated with equipment shutdowns, which
may be caused by the loss or interruption of electrical power to manufacturing facilities due to unusually high demand,
blackouts, adverse weather, equipment failure or other catastrophic events. Losses caused by disruptions in the supply of
electrical power could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we are dependent on third-party suppliers of raw materials and packaging for our products. Our
suppliers may fail to meet timelines or contractual obligations or provide sufficient products, which may adversely affect
our business. Failure to appropriately structure or adequately manage our agreements with third parties may adversely
affect our availability of supply, which in turn affects our ability to manufacture our products.

We are also dependent on third parties for most of our warehousing and substantially all of our transportation
requirements. Certain factors affecting distribution costs, including oil prices, are either subject to market fluctuations or
controlled by our third-party carriers. For example, fuel prices have been high in recent years and have fluctuated as a
result of various factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as global and regional supply and demand.
Moreover, geopolitical and economic uncertainties due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the
conflict in the Middle East, which have threatened supply lines and resulted in embargoes of certain supply sources, as
well as pricing and availability of fuel supplies.

Moreover, temporary or long-term disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, strikes,
lockouts or other events could impair our ability to supply products affordably or in a timely manner. If we are unable to
timely receive raw materials or produce and effectively distribute sufficient quantities in response to demand for our
products, consumers may look to purchase alternative or competitive products. Moreover, if we are unable to manage
our supply chain efficiently, our operating costs could increase, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Additionally, in some markets we rely on a small number of distributors to satisfy demand from numerous, small,
traditional trade outlets. Also in Brazil and Peru we serve the market with only one major distributor for each of those
countries. The failure of any of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations in such market. This could, in turn, also have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_An inability to invest in the image of our brands to prevent erosion of the reputation or appeal of one or more of_**
**_our leading brands may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

We are a global organization, with different strategies in place with respect to marketing, pricing and pack size
across different markets. Strategic decisions taken for any particular market that turn out to be unsuccessful can create a
public backlash and have an unfavorable impact across the Group. A significant majority of our net sales derives from
sales of our power brands, and the success of our business has resulted from the strength of our brands. Our financial
success is directly dependent on consumer and customer perception of such key brands, including as an example, Flora,
Country Crock, Becel+ProActiv, Rama, BlueBand and Violife. The success of our brands may suffer if our marketing
plans, marketing spend levels or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or our ability to
attract consumers or if consumer or customer perceptions of our brands or products change unfavorably. In particular,
our investments in marketing activities for any new brands and projects may divert resources from our existing brands
and products, and there can be no assurance that such investments will be successful or that consumer or customer
perceptions of our existing brands will not suffer as a result. In addition, our results of operations could be negatively
affected if the reputation of one or more of our brands suffers damage due to real or perceived quality issues with our
products, unsuccessful marketing campaigns or if we have found to have materially violated any applicable laws or
regulations. We have limited control over third-party manufacturers, distributors and other commercial partners. Any

30


-----

failure of such third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our
reputation and result in product recalls, product liability claims and economic loss.

In addition, unsuccessful interactions with governments and NGOs of the countries we are operating in may
also affect the perception of the Group by our investors, cause reputational damage and adversely affect our results of
operations. Any circumstances which publicly damage our customer goodwill, injures our reputation or damages our
business relationships may lead to a broader adverse effect on our business and prospects by way of loss of business,
goodwill, customers and employees beyond the monetary liability arising directly from the damaging events.

**_Fluctuations in energy and freight costs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

In addition to our dependence on primary raw materials, due to the energy intensive nature of our manufacturing
process and the critical importance of transportation to our manufacturing, supply and logistics processes, we rely on a
number of different energy sources, including oil, electricity and natural gas. If, for any reason, certain of our energy
supply contracts were terminated in a country where we have major operations, or were not renewed upon expiration, or
if market conditions were to substantially change resulting in a significant decrease in energy supply in the European
Union or a significant increase in the price of oil, electricity or natural gas, including as a result of the heightened energy
prices following the war in Ukraine, we may not be able to find alternative, comparable suppliers or suppliers capable of
providing oil, electricity or natural gas on pricing, terms or volume satisfactory to us, or we may be forced to change our
manufacturing practices, thereby increasing our operational costs and potential carbon footprint. As a result of any of
these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.

We also heavily rely on third parties for the transportation of our raw materials, as well as for the products we
manufacture and sell. In certain jurisdictions, we are exposed to import duties and freight costs. Freight costs are
influenced by carrier availability and fluctuating oil prices, which, in turn, have been impacted by the ongoing inflationary
surge and related supply chain disruptions. Major global events such as fluctuating commodity prices, geopolitical
conflicts, new regulations like the new EU mobility package (which aims to promote road safety and better working
conditions for drivers through the adoption of certain limitations like drivers’ driving times and rest period) may increase
the cost base of our carriers or cause interruptions in our transportation operations. For instance, the recent military conflict
between Israel and Hamas and its spillover effects throughout the Middle East, including the Red Sea, has led to delays
and increased freight rates due to the rerouting of ships around South Africa. Such events could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our strong brands and presence in the markets we
operate in provides us the ability to pass on such input prices to our customers, however, such ability is limited and we
may not be able to agree price adjustments to effectively cover our energy costs with our customers, or may only be able
to pass them through on a delayed basis. Moreover, an increase in the selling prices for our products resulting from an
attempt to pass through increased energy or freight costs may decrease the price competitiveness of our products, which
may negatively impact the volume of our sales, and in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. While we have hedging arrangments in place and manage risks related to transportation through our
monitoring systems and a tailored procurement process with respect to our third-party logistics providers, our current
policies and precautionary actions cannot fully eliminate any of the above risks.

**_Our future results and competitive position are dependent on the successful development of new products and_**
**_improvement of existing products, as well as the implementation of other growth and business development initiatives,_**
**_which are subject to a number of difficulties and uncertainties._**

Our future results and ability to maintain or improve our competitive position depend on our ability to identify,
develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products successfully. A key element of our growth strategy is
to introduce new products and continue to upgrade, re-launch and extend existing product lines in each of the markets
in which we operate to increase overall sales of our products. We will also seek to expand our distribution channels.
There can be no assurance that any new product line or channel which we might expand into will develop into a viable
offering, or that any investment made in expanding into such adjacent product categories or distribution channels will be
adequately rewarded.

By 2050, our global food system is expected to need to feed nearly 10 billion people worldwide. We believe that
this requires a shift to predominantly plant-based diets with lower consumption of animal derived foods. To meet this
challenge, we aim to be 100% plant-based by 2030, which requires continued active innovation and reformulation of our
products. However, the launch and success of new or modified products are inherently uncertain, and there can be no
assurance as to our continuing ability to develop and launch successful new products or variations of existing products.
The success of our product development is affected by our ability to anticipate changing consumer trends and preferences,
to leverage our research and development capabilities, and to utilize management’s ability to launch new or improved
products quickly, successfully and on a cost-effective basis. If we are unsuccessful in developing new products in an

31


-----

efficient and economical manner and we do not achieve the desired results from our strategic partnerships, demand for
our products may decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Moreover, our business can be affected by risks related to expansion into new international markets, particularly
emerging markets. We are also exposed to reputational risks connected to a potential failure to manage and properly
implement these growth initiatives. New international markets could develop more slowly than we expect at any given
time. Entry into a new market may require a local manufacturing or distribution partner, which may be difficult to obtain
or slow down the speed of expansion. Should further expansion into international markets not be successful or not be as
successful as planned, the investments made might not result in the desired growth in revenue, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Growth can carry risks relating to the adequacy of our resources and the capacity of management and employees
to properly manage all critical issues, resulting in a focus on certain initiatives to the detriment of others and a failure
to properly anticipate risks to our global supply chain. Growth risks also include risks related to potential mergers and
acquisitions, including potential liability under acquisition agreements, product liability and environmental responsibility
risks as well as reputational and personnel related risks. The success of any merger or acquisition is also dependent on
our management’s ability to successfully integrate such companies into existing operations. Any failure to manage risks
related to potential mergers and acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

**_Our international operations are subject to various risks that may have a material adverse effect on our results of_**
**_operations._**

Globally we currently own 14 manufacturing facilities, 38 offices and one research and development center and
our brands are sold and distributed in more than (either directly or indirectly via distributors) 100 countries across five
continents.

As part of our strategy, we will continue to seek to expand our sales and market share in various international
markets, including by acquiring new companies to enable us to expand our product offering. The economies of some of
the countries in which we operate in Eastern Europe, Asia, LatAm and Africa differ from the economies of Western
Europe, the United States and Canada and in some cases present a greater risk profile. Many of these countries have
implemented measures aimed at improving the business environment and providing a stable platform for economic
development. However, the political, economic and legal reforms necessary to complete such a transformation may not
be implemented fully or may not be successful, and the governments of these countries may implement policies, measures,
controls or other actions which could restrict our business operations, acceptance of our products or harm our financial
results. The risks inherent in the countries where we operate include, but are not limited to:

    - political, social and economic instability;

    - fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations;

    - government policies and regulations, including more stringent regulation on labelling, packaging, including
the use of plastic, deforestation, payment terms or in respect of labor laws;

    - more stringent reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, supply chain due diligence reporting
requirements and ESG reporting requirements;

    - tariffs, duties, export controls and other trade barriers;

    - varying tax regimes that could harm our results of operations, including withholding and other taxes on
remittances and other payments by our subsidiaries;

    - longer account receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;

    - foreign exchange controls or restrictions on profit repatriation;

    - nationalization or expropriation of property without fair compensation;

    - recessionary trends, inflation and instability of the financial markets;

    - the introduction or application of more stringent restrictions on investments;

32


-----

    - the possibility of natural disaster (including the earthquake in Turkey in 2022), war (including the ongoing
war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East), civil disturbance, acts of terrorism or other social conflicts;

    - any epidemics or pandemics, ineffective and varying responses from local governments and competent
authorities;

    - unfair competition, in certain markets in which we compete;

    - changes in the interest rate environment; and

    - fluctuations in local economic growth.

We are exposed to these risks in all of our operations to some degree, and such exposure may reduce demand
for our products and as a result negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, especially in emerging
markets where the political and legal environment is less stable. Although we have monitoring practices and policies in
place to tackle risks that arise during the course of our business, the systems, policies and practices we implement may
not be sufficient to fully anticipate these risks before they arise or we may not be able to effectively manage these risks.
As a result, we may be subject to material adverse developments with respect to our international operations or incur
additional costs while managing these risks and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If we are
unable to expand our businesses across both developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks
associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these
markets, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.

**_Potential future impairments of intangible assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Goodwill is a significant asset of the Group. As of March 31, 2024, the book value of our goodwill amounted to
€3,827 million, while our other intangible assets amounted to €3,307 million. In accordance with IFRS, we evaluate
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually, or earlier in the case of a triggering event. Goodwill
impairment is indicated and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired when their carrying amount exceeds their
estimated recoverable amount, which is the greater of their value in use and their fair value less cost to sell. A decrease
in expected cash flows, changes in market conditions, loss of key customers or a change in our imputed cost of capital
may require potential impairment of recorded goodwill and/or other intangible assets. Weakness in the global economy,
including due to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the recent inflationary surge, also may cause
us to make impairment charges. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to the income
statement. Although the Group has not recorded any charges for goodwill impairment during its most recent year, there
can be no assurance that goodwill impairment charges will not be incurred in the future. Any future impairment could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risks and such may have a material adverse effect on our results of_**
**_operations._**

We operate internationally and, as a result, we have considerable cash flow, revenue, costs, assets and liabilities
in foreign currencies and are exposed to changes in various currency exchange rates. We have exchange rate exposure
in our key markets particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the
Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Indonesian rupiah and the Turkish lira against the euro. Our exposure to changes
in exchange rates can mainly be described in terms of translation exposure and transaction exposure.

To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate our assets, liabilities, net sales and costs
into euro. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the euro against these other currencies will affect the
amounts attributed to these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their
original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For
example, the significant Turkish lira depreciation was a main contributor in the decline of net sales in AMEA, as reported
in euro, for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, the euro to pound sterling and the euro to U.S. dollar
exchange rates have been volatile during recent years due to various factors including the war in Ukraine, the conflict
in the Middle East, Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

In addition, our exchange rate transaction risks principally relate to purchases of raw materials including Plant
Oils, which have underlying global commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollar or may have a degree of
correlation with the U.S. dollar (despite underlying indexes being priced in euro or other currencies). As a result hereof,
we are exposed to a transaction risk since such U.S. dollar denominated raw materials are mainly invoiced to us in euro.

33


-----

Other ingredient and packaging costs (apart from certain commodity inputs) are generally denominated in the functional
currencies of the jurisdictions in which our operations (including manufacturing plants and distribution hubs) are located,
which in most cases correlate to the markets and currencies in which sales are made. Therefore, to the extent we incur
costs that are not denominated in the same currency as the related net sales, exchange rate fluctuations could cause our
costs to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our gross profit margin.

Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations applicable in_**
**_the countries in which we operate or in which we may operate in the future._**

We sell and distribute our brands in more than 100 countries across five continents and we, our business partners,
our agents, employees must comply with applicable local laws, as well as certain anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other
similar regulations. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the European
Anti-Bribery Conventions and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their
intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business.
We are also subject to a number of modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labor reporting, training and due
diligence laws, such as the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 and similar legislation in various jurisdictions and additional
statutory regimes to fight these crimes may be enacted in the future.

Due to the global scale of our business, some of our operations may be conducted in jurisdictions that lack a
developed legal system or have experienced widespread corruption. Under certain circumstances, strict compliance with
anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. While we have a robust compliance framework in
place that is spread across our key regions to identify and mitigate the risks of breach of local laws, fraud, bribery,
corruption and any incidents involving ethics and integrity, and conduct regular trainings with different parts of the
business on regional laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we can detect or prevent every instance of fraud,
bribery, corruption or breaches of ethics or integrity involving our employees, business partners or agents.

Furthermore, operating under multiple jurisdictions adds complexity in relation to tracking, understanding and
abiding to laws and regulations. We have domestic distribution channels (i.e., our retailers and distributors) in our markets
and our products meet our end-consumers through these intermediaries. There is a risk that such distribution channels
may take misaligned decisions that would violate local laws or may be involved in illegitimate activities in local markets
that are unknown to us. If we fail to adequately monitor them or maintain an adequate compliance program, we may be
liable for their actions.

Violations of anti-corruption laws can result in civil penalties, fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions,
asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of
licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively impact our reputation and
consequently, our ability to enter into new contracts or renew our existing contracts. On the other hand, any such violation
by our competitors, if undetected, could give them an unfair advantage when bidding for contracts. The consequences
that we may suffer due to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Climate change and extreme weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

The impact of climate change may materially and adversely impact the cost, production and financial
performance of our business. There is an increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due
to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will continue
to cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme
weather events. Any impacts on our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over
a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. We have partnered with
climate experts to conduct a climate scenario analysis aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Our analysis has shown that with a potential temperature increase of 3 degrees
Celsius, there will be a risk of more frequent severe weather events such as floods and heatwaves.

Severe weather events may result in adverse physical impacts on our sites, natural resources on which we use in
our production process, such as water, or portions of our infrastructure, which could disrupt our supply chain and
ultimately our business operations. Major weather phenomena like El Niño and La Niña may have a dramatic effect on
agricultural activities and crops. The El Niño weather phenomenon has now returned and is expected to last at least
through the first half of 2024, resulting in further temperature increases both on land and at sea. This may result in seasonal

34


-----

drought and harm agriculture in certain regions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sourced the majority of our
palm oil (which counts for approximately 36% of our total Plant Oils volume) from Indonesia and Malaysia, so the
growing climate concerns in these countries carry heightened importance. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain
regions as a result of changing weather patterns may affect the quality, limit the availability or increase the cost of key
raw materials and cause delays or disruptions in our production and logistics. Although we have developed procedures to
respond to the effects of such events, including our ability to flex and change our recipes and pivot to alternative
ingredients, where appropriate, and our overall analysis aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD indicated a low
financial risk on gross revenue, our efforts may not be sufficient. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a
material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

**_We rely substantially on sales to large food retailers and in the event they give higher priority to private label_**
**_or other branded products, or if the concentration and buying power of these large retailers increase, our business_**
**_could be adversely affected._**

Our customers include supermarkets and large chain food retailers across Europe and the Americas and
merchants in AMEA. Throughout our markets, and particularly in Europe and the United States (where we derived the
majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023), the food retail segments are highly concentrated. In
recent years, the major retailers in many of our key markets have increased their share of the grocery market through
consolidation, pricing initiatives (such as discounts and promotions) or other measures. Many retailers have also formed
or joined buying groups and buying alliances, including a number of European based groups such as Epic Partners,
Everest, Eurelec and Eureka amongst others, and price competition between retailers has intensified. This price
competition has led retailers, buying groups and alliances to seek lower prices from their suppliers, including us, and in
some cases to protracted negotiations. The strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position gives them significant
leverage over their suppliers in negotiating pricing, product specification and the level of supplier participation in
promotional campaigns and offers, which can reduce our gross profit margins. Further consolidation among the major
retailers or disproportionate customer growth in relation to their competitors could increase their relative negotiating
power and allow them to force a negative shift in our trade terms. Our results of operations could also be adversely
affected if we are required to reduce our prices or increase our promotional spending activity as a consequence of an
increase in the strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position, if we lose business from a major retail customer or if
our relationship with a major customer deteriorates.

Food retailers, including mainstream grocery chains which carry our products as well as discount chains (such
as Aldi and Lidl) which tend not to carry major brands, also offer generic or private label products that compete directly
with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. There is a risk that our customers may give higher
priority to private label products or the branded products of our competitors, which would adversely affect sales of our
products. In addition, given the growth in market share of discount grocery chains, there is a risk that consumers could
increasingly shop at discount chains offering only private label products, which would adversely affect sales of our
products and put increasing pressure on our mainstream grocery chain customers. In these circumstances, consumers
may choose to economize by purchasing non-branded or private label brands. In the event our tenders to supply private
label products to certain retailers, we may win back some volume but at the expense of lower net sales and gross profit
margins. We may be unable to adequately respond to these trends and, as a result, the volume of our sales may decrease
or we may need to lower the prices of our products, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We depend on information technology (“IT”) systems to operate our business. Any failure, data security breach or_**
**_technological changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Our business activities rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our various
computer and communication systems, including IT platforms such as our fully digital, cloud-based Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) system SAP4Hana. Any failure of our IT systems or any ineffective digital transformations (including
upgrades and/or migrations to new suppliers, new systems or applications) or system designs could impair our ability to
receive, process and reconcile transactions, manage supply chain and manufacturing functions, manage compliance and
risk functions, and conduct other day-to-day operations of the business. Such digital transformations also rely on effective
master data management and business change management, in combination with overall IT systems. In addition, our
computer and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including
attacks by computer malware, electronic break-ins or cyber-attacks, theft or corruption of confidential data or other
unanticipated problems. We have implemented backup and restoration solutions to ensure speedy recovery across our key
IT platforms, improved our disaster recovery plans around critical processes during crisis and entered into improved
service level agreements with third-party suppliers. However, any significant disruption of our computer or
communication systems could affect our ability to manage our IT systems or lead to recovery costs, litigation brought by

35


-----

customers or business partners, reputational damage or a diminished ability to operate the business, which in turn could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, if we enter into acquisition transactions in the future, the process of integrating the information
systems of the businesses we acquire may be complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately
identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems. For example, we acquired Arivia in 2020 and successfully
completed Arivia’s IT integration to our IT platform in the year ended December 31, 2023. During the integration process,
we were exposed to risk of disruption of our IT systems. Such disruption could ultimately prevent us from meeting our
strategic objectives and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As part of our business, we collect, retain and process certain confidential information, including the personal
data of consumers, customers and employees. As a result, our operations are subject to data protection and privacy laws,
including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “EU GDPR”). Further, the General Data Protection Regulation
(EU) 2016/679 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK GDPR” and together with the EU
GDPR, “GDPR”) came into effect on January 1, 2021, and, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018,
retains the EU GDPR in UK national law following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. The relationship
between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains uncertain. Therefore,
compliance with the GDPR may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliancerelated costs and expenses and these changes may lead to other additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.
Moreover, the GDPR may lead to significant financial penalties if we breach the requirements thereof. In addition, noncompliance or technical defects resulting in a leak or the misuse of personal data could also result in damage to our
reputation and otherwise harm our business. Moreover, we do not currently have specific data security insurance coverage
and we cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in
the event of a breach of our data security systems. Should one or more of these risks materialize, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to credit risk with respect to our customers and suppliers._**

Our business is subject to the risks of non-payment and non-performance by our customers. We manage
our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, monitoring procedures, credit insurance, factoring and sometimes uses
of letters of credit, prepayments and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies cannot fully eliminate customer
credit risk, and to the extent our policies and procedures prove to be inadequate, it could negatively affect our financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our customers, particularly in emerging markets, may be subject
to their own operating and regulatory risks and, even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we
may experience financial losses in our dealings with such parties. If our customers fail to fulfil their contractual
obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.

Moreover, countries in which we operate may enact new laws that limit payment terms, which may have an
adverse effect on our business. For example, the European Union has proposed a new regulation on late payments on
September 12, 2023 that aims to limit payment terms to small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) to 30 days to ensure
fairness in commercial transactions. Should the scope of application of such regulation be extended beyond small and
medium enterprises to also include large companies (from whom we source a majority of our Plant Oils and other key
ingredients), such regulation may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and our profitability or may lead to
renegotiations with some of our suppliers.

We are also subject to credit risk with respect to our third-party suppliers. If any such suppliers become insolvent,
an appointed trustee could potentially ignore the service contracts we have in place with such party, resulting in
increased charges or the termination of the service contracts. We may not be able to replace a service provider within a
reasonable period of time, on as favorable terms or without disruption to our operations.

Any of the foregoing factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
operating cash flow and liquidity (especially since we historically managed our trade payables typically on 90 to 120 day
terms), as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property effectively and any inability to protect our_**
**_intellectual property could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business._**

Our business depends substantially on the legal protection of proprietary rights in intellectual property that we
own or license. We also claim proprietary rights in various patented technologies, know-how, trade secrets (including
formulas), trademarks and service marks relating to our products and manufacturing processes. Our ability to implement
our business plan depends in part on our ability to expand brand recognition using trademarks, service marks and other

36


-----

proprietary intellectual property, including for our brand names and logos, and on our ability to exploit our proprietary
knowledge with respect to manufacturing processes. If existing contractual measures fail to protect our proprietary rights,
or if any third party misappropriates or infringes our intellectual property, any advantage those proprietary rights provide
may be negated and the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business
and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance.

Monitoring infringement of intellectual property rights is difficult and we cannot be certain that the precautions
we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property (including trade secrets and know-how),
particularly in countries where we do not have trademarks or patents at all or where the laws of such country may not be
a member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, an international treaty that provides a
framework for mutual recognition of patents and trademarks among member countries, and thus we may not have the
desired level of protection of our proprietary rights. As we expand our operations into new markets, we become
increasingly exposed to intellectual property laws, which may prove to be inadequate for protecting our rights.
Accordingly, other parties, including competitors, may duplicate our products using our proprietary technologies.

Pursuing legal remedies against persons infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights or otherwise
improperly using our proprietary information is a costly and time-consuming process that could divert resources from the
conduct of our business. When we or our licensor seeks to enforce their respective intellectual property rights, defendants
are permitted to challenge the validity of the relevant intellectual property, which could have the impact of invalidating
or limiting the scope of our owned or licensed intellectual property, which may cause harm to our image, brand or
competitive position. In addition, patent infringement cases can involve hearings in which the court determines the
boundaries of the patent in dispute, which could limit the utility of our or our licensor’s patents.

**_Costs or liabilities relating to compliance with applicable directives, regulations and laws may have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our results of operations._**

As a producer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries
in which we operate, in particular Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom, which govern production,
composition, manufacturing, storage, transport, advertising, packaging, health, quality, labelling, safety and distribution
standards. There is a risk that any of the countries in which we operate enact unfavorable regulations, which may have an
impact on our business growth, including regulations concerning packaging, raw materials or reformulation requirements.
Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including
fines, injunctions, product recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our industry also faces increasing public and community pressure to consume energy more efficiently, including
through the use of renewable fuels, and to reduce waste. For example, the European Union’s Deforestation Regulation
(Regulation (EU) 2023/1115) (the “Deforestation Regulation”), came into force on June 29, 2023 and bans import of
certain commodities, including palm oil, soy and paper, if they are produced by contributing to deforestation of lands. We
have sustainable palm oil, soy and paper policies in place and, on the basis thereof, we have taken measures to ensure our
suppliers adhere to our commitment to no deforestation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 100% of our palm oil
and soybean oil were sustainably sourced and 100% of our paper and pulp supply was sustainably sourced. Even though
we have taken measures to ensure transparency, and have a strong level of due diligence in monitoring our supply chains,
with stricter environmental policies being implemented in the regions in which we operate, we may fail to fully adhere to
these heightened regulatory requirements. Not adhering to the Deforestation Regulation may cause material disruptions
in our supply chain, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In addition, on January 5, 2023, EU Directive No 2464/2022 on Corporate Sustainability Reporting (the
“CSRD”) was adopted and entered into force. The CSRD introduces new mandatory reporting obligations that will require
the publication of sustainability information. Further reporting standards are due to be adopted by June 2026, including
for in-scope non-EU entities. Companies that fall under the scope of the CSRD have to report in their annual reports to
what extent their activities are covered by the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate
sustainable investment (the “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) and comply with the criteria set in the EU Taxonomy
Regulation delegated acts. Following the coming into force of CSRD, we expect to cover any additional reporting required
by CSRD and not already covered in our reporting for the period beginning with the year ended December 31, 2025.

Moreover, regulators may impose heightened disclosure requirements concerning our supply chain or ESGrelated matters, such as the proposed EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), or may impose
further restrictions that may affect how we conduct our business, such as the proposed EU regulation on late payments
on September 12, 2023 that aims to limit payment terms to SMEs to 30 days to ensure fairness in commercial transactions.

37


-----

Moreover, we might incur additional operational costs while ensuring compliance with these new regulations and any
failure to adapt to these regulatory changes may lead to penalties and reputational harm.

In addition, our manufacturing facilities as well as those of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers are
subject to licensing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities. These
governmental authorities differ between jurisdictions but broadly include national and local health, environmental, labor
relations, sanitation, building, zoning, and fire and safety departments. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the
necessary licenses or approval could delay or prevent the development, expansion or operation of a given production or
warehouse facility. Any changes in those regulations may require us to implement new quality controls and possibly
invest in new equipment, which could delay the development of new products and increase our operating costs.

All of our products must comply with strict national and international hygiene regulations. Our facilities and our
suppliers’ facilities are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to
the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms and other raw
materials. Despite the precautions we undertake, should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered during
an inspection or otherwise, authorities may temporarily shut down any of our facilities and levy a fine for such noncompliance.

Finally, any attempt to expand production may attract the scrutiny of European and other competition and antitrust regulators, and such an attempt may not succeed. In addition, our size and prominence in the butters and spreads
market may prompt heightened scrutiny by such regulators seeking to restrain anti-competitive market practices. Any
competition or anti-trust investigation could require significant legal expenditures and result in liabilities or adverse
governmental orders. Such developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may be adversely impacted by environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, including if we are unable_**
**_to meet goals and commitments that we establish in relation to such matters._**

In recent years, there has been an increased focus from investors, governmental and nongovernmental entities,
and the public on ESG matters, including greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, packaging and waste, practices
related to sustainable supply chain, energy use, diversity, equity and inclusion, human rights and social commitment. A
variety of organizations evaluate, and measure the performance of, companies on such ESG matters, and the results of
these assessments are widely publicized. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices
and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company’s ESG or sustainability scores as a
reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, customer, or
employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation, and customer and employee retention may be
negatively impacted.

We have established and publicly announced certain ESG goals, commitments and targets which we may refine
or even expand further in the future. For example, we have four ESG pillars: (i) plant-based, (ii) healthier lives, (iii)
happier people and (iv) better planet, and we have set goals as part of our corporate ESG strategy under each of these
pillars.

The execution of our ESG strategy to achieve these goals, commitments, and targets are subject to risks and
uncertainties, many of which may be outside of our control and prove to be more costly than we anticipate. These risks
and uncertainties include our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within the currently projected costs
and the expected timeframes, unforeseen operational and technological difficulties, the outcome of research efforts and
future technology developments and the success of our collaborations with third parties. It is possible that stakeholders
may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also incur additional
costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. Any failure, or perceived
failure, to achieve our ESG goals, commitments, and targets could damage our reputation and customer, investor and
other stakeholder relationships, and may even result in regulatory enforcement action. Such conditions could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Adverse developments with respect to the safety or quality of products of the plant-based industry in general or of our_**
**_products specifically, as well as evolving nutritional and health-related concerns, may damage our reputation, increase_**
**_our costs of operations and decrease demand for our products._**

Food safety, and the public’s awareness that our products are safe and healthy, are essential to our image
and business. We sell food products for human consumption, which subjects us to safety risks such as product
contamination, spoilage, misbranding or product tampering. Product contamination, including the presence of a foreign

38


-----

object, substance, and chemical or other agent or residue could require product withdrawals, recalls, or the destruction
of inventory, and could result in negative publicity, temporary plant closures and substantial costs of compliance or
remediation. We are also subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread
contamination. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products in response to public health
concerns and consumers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy.

We may be harmed by publicity concerning any assertion that our products caused illness or injury, and
could become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness stemming from product contamination
or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products. Any significant lawsuit or widespread
product recall or other events leading to the loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products could
damage our brand, reputation and image and negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects for growth, and
consequently also the value of our brands. In addition, product recalls are difficult to foresee and prepare for and, in the
event we are required to recall one or more of our products, such recall may result in damage to our brands’ image, loss
of sales and diversion of management’s time and attention. We maintain systems designed to monitor food safety risks
and require our suppliers to do so as well. However, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will be successful or that such
risks will not materialize. In addition, although we attempt, through contractual relationships and regular inspections, to
control the risk of contamination caused by third parties in relation to the manufacturing and distribution processes we
outsource, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will be successful or that contamination of our products by third parties
will not materialize.

We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury or death stemming
from the consumption of a mislabeled, misbranded, altered, contaminated or spoiled product, which could negatively
affect our business. Awards of damages, settlement amounts and fees and expenses resulting from such claims and the
public relations implications of any such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. The availability and price of insurance to cover claims for damages are subject to market forces that
we do not control, and such insurance may not cover all the costs of such claims and would not cover damage to our
reputation. Even if product liability claims against us are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly
and time consuming, increase our insurance premiums and divert management’s time and resources towards defending
them rather than operating the business. In addition, any adverse publicity concerning such claims, even if unfounded,
could cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products and damage our reputation and brand
image.

Evolving nutritional and health-related concerns have led to negative publicity in the food industry concerning
the health implications of genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”), obesity, trans-fat and diacetyl. In particular, the
food industry has been experiencing a significant trend in which an increasing number of consumers are requiring only
non-GMO and other specialized ingredients in their foods. Part of our contribution to the shift towards more plant-based
diets is our 100% plant-based target by 2030, which requires active innovation and reformulation of several of our
products. In order to replicate the texture of animal-derived foods using dairy-free ingredients, we sometimes rely on the
use of enzymes or other proteins produced by GMOs to replace animal proteins, just as genetically modified enzymes are
used in the production of many foods (for example, chymosin is an enzyme used to produce some dairy cheeses, it can
be obtained from animal and from GMO sources). We seek to control any potential risks of using GMOs in our products
by following all regulatory requirements to ensure our products are safe, including the sourcing of GMO and non-GMO
ingredients. Sourcing non-GMO and other specialized ingredients increases costs because such raw materials are
generally less widely available and therefore more expensive and we may not be able to increase our prices to reflect
this increased cost. As additional retailers require or consider requiring all of their products to be non-GMO, additional
pressure may come to bear on manufacturers to find sources of raw materials which are non-GMO and to assure
absence of GMO from their respective supply chains. This may be particularly difficult in the United States, where most
farmers produce genetically modified foods, making it difficult to source and assure non-GMO ingredients and raw
materials. Companies that fail to source and assure non-GMO and other specialized ingredients could, over time, lose
market share, suffer harm to their brand images and face decreasing sales. Consumers may increasingly require that foods
meet stricter standards than are required by applicable governmental agencies, which would further increase the cost of
manufacturing such foods and ingredients. In addition, legislation could also require companies to move to GMO-free
labelling or other higher cost ingredients, which could result in changes to our labelling, advertising and/or packaging.

Any of the foregoing factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

39


-----

**_Significant disruption in our workforce, increasing labor costs or work stoppages by unionized employees may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

We have in the past, and may in the future, experience labor disputes and work stoppages at one or more of our
manufacturing facilities due to localized strikes or strikes in the larger retail food industry sector. We have also
been involved in negotiations on collective bargaining agreements. A labor stoppage or other interruption at one of our
manufacturing facilities could impact our ability to supply customers and could have a pronounced effect on our
operations. Future labor disturbances or work stoppages at any of our or our suppliers’ facilities or affecting their supply
chains, or an inability to negotiate or renew collective bargaining agreements from time to time on suitable terms or at
all, may have an adverse effect on such facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

An increase in labor and employee benefit costs could adversely affect our profitability. Most of the factors
affecting labor costs are beyond our control and we may not be able to adjust our pricing to reflect an increase in labor
costs. A shortage of qualified employees, general inflationary pressure on wages or an increase in national minimum
wages or industry or union agreed wages in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our labor costs
and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Seasonal fluctuations in product demand may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Our sales have historically been affected by seasonal cyclicality in customer orders in various markets. The
extent and impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which we operate. For example, the U.S.
business typically experiences a spike in the fourth quarter of the year which is driven by Thanksgiving and Christmas
baking. Similarly, there can be some seasonality in sales in Europe and the Americas owing to Easter, which can occur
during the first or second quarter of the year. Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak in butter and spreads usage for cooking
and baking during the Ramadan festival season, which can occur in various quarters from year to year. Furthermore,
across all the countries in which we operate, the timing of product promotions drives volatility from normal consumption.
While our sales are seasonal, many of our costs, such as personnel costs, are incurred more evenly throughout the year,
which could affect measures of profitability in the short term and put pressure on our working capital position. In addition,
for these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a reliable indication of the performance of our business
or how we may perform in the future.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal
proceedings brought or threatened against us, including but not limited to, claims brought by third parties. These actions
and proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged breach of contract or violation of consumer
protection statutes and other regulations, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, liquidated damages,
consequential damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending
ourselves in civil, criminal or regulatory actions. These actions may relate to commercial, employment, environmental,
food quality, food safety, food labelling, anti-trust, international trade, taxation, intellectual property, advertising and
similar matters. For example, our marketing could face allegations of false or misleading advertising or other criticisms
which could result in litigation and potential liabilities or costs in certain jurisdictions. For example, since 2022 a series
of alleged putative class action lawsuits have been brought or threatened against Upfield US Inc., which generally allege
that Upfield US Inc. has engaged in misleading labelling and advertising of its products and violated various state
consumer fraud and deceptive business practice acts. The plaintiffs seek to certify classes of individuals who have
purchased the named products in certain states within the United States. See “Business—Litigation.” In addition, we
could incur substantial costs and fees in defending ourselves or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting
new legal requirements. The costs and other effects of pending and potential litigation and administrative actions against
us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations. Furthermore,
because litigation is inherently uncertain, the ultimate resolution of any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding through
settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.

In the event we are unsuccessful in any litigation, proceedings or other disputes, we could be exposed to the risk
that the provisions for associated costs and fees, if any, may be insufficient or that, even if we are not impacted monetarily,
we could face the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements or inspections and/or could suffer damage to our
image and reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_We are exposed to local business and tax risks in many different countries._**

We operate in numerous countries across Europe, North America, LatAm, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. As
a result, our business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements,
economic conditions and unforeseeable developments in these markets, all or any of which could result in disruption
of our activities. These risks include, among others, political instability, differing economic cycles and adverse
economic conditions, unexpected changes in regulatory environments, currency exchange rate fluctuations, inability to
collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague commercial or other laws, changes in
distribution and supply channels, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds, and difficulties
in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees. Our overall success in the markets in which we
operate depends, to a considerable extent, on our ability to effectively manage differing legal, political, social and
regulatory requirements, economic conditions and unforeseeable developments. We cannot guarantee that we will
succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies which will be effective in each location where we do
business.

We must comply with complex and evolving tax regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate,
which subjects us to international tax compliance risks. Some tax jurisdictions in which we operate have complex and
subjective rules regarding income tax, value-added tax, sales or excise tax and transfer tax. Additionally, we are subject
to Pillar Two’s global minimum tax. The impact per jurisdiction depends on the implementation of the OECD’s Global
Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules or the EU’s Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 of December 14, 2022 on ensuring a
global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the European
Union. From time to time, we may be subject to tax audits in certain jurisdictions, which may subject our business in such
jurisdictions to restrictions pending resolution and pursuant to which we may be required to pay additional taxes, interest
or penalties should the taxing authority assert different interpretations, or different allocations or valuations of our services
which could be material and could reduce our income and cash flow.

**_Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract new management and other personnel,_**
**_may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Our success depends, in part, upon the continued services of key members of our management. Our executives’
and managers’ knowledge of the market and our business represent a key strength of our business, which cannot be
easily replicated. The success of our business strategy and our future growth also depends on our ability to attract,
train, retain and motivate skilled managerial, sales, administration, development and operating personnel. Competition
for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on innovation is intense, and the loss of qualified personnel
or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled personnel required for the operation and growth of
our business could hinder our ability to conduct research and development activities successfully or develop and support
new products.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain experienced, qualified employees to carry out
our strategy in the future. The loss of one or more of our key management or operating personnel, or the failure to
attract and retain additional key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We could incur material costs to address violations of, or liabilities under, health, safety and environmental_**
**_regulations._**

Our facilities and operations are subject to numerous health, safety and environmental regulations, including
local and national laws, the United States federal and state legislation and regulations, and European directives and
regulations governing, among other things, water supply and use, water discharges, air emissions, chemical safety, solid
and hazardous waste management and disposal, clean-up of contamination, energy use, noise pollution, and workplace
health and safety. Health, safety and environmental legislation in Europe, the United States and elsewhere have generally
become more comprehensive and restrictive and more rigid over time and enforcement has become more stringent. Failure
to comply with applicable requirements, or the terms of required permits, can result in penalties or fines, clean-up costs,
third-party property damage and personal injury claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand,
business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if health, safety and environmental laws and
regulations in the countries in which we operate or from which we source raw materials and ingredients become more
stringent in the future, the extent and timing of investments required to maintain compliance may exceed our budget
or estimates and may limit the availability of funding for other investments.

Furthermore, under some environmental laws, we could be liable for costs incurred in investigating or
remediating contamination at our facilities, even if the contamination was caused by an unrelated party, and even if the

41


-----

activity which caused the contamination was legal at the time it occurred. The discovery of previously unknown
contamination, or the imposition of new or more burdensome obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at
our properties or at third-party sites, could result in substantial unanticipated costs which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In certain jurisdictions, we are also subject to legislation designed to significantly reduce industrial energy use,
carbon dioxide emissions and the emission of ozone depleting compounds more generally. If we fail to meet applicable
standards for energy use reduction or are unable to decrease, and in some cases eliminate, certain emissions within the
applicable period required by relevant laws and regulations, we could be subject to significant penalties or fines and
temporary or long-term disruptions to production at our facilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all exposures are insurable and we may experience
major incidents of a nature that are not covered by our insurance. Our insurance policies cover, among other things,
employee-related accidents and injuries, property damage and liability deriving from our activities. We maintain an
amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue
to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances
and against all liabilities to which we may be subject. We could, for example, be subject to substantial claims for damages
upon the occurrence of several events within one calendar year. In addition, our insurance costs may increase over time
in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market
in general.

**_Due to restrictions on the deduction of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry-forwards under Dutch law, we_**
**_may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

The proceeds of this Offering will be utilized by us in connection with the partial redemption of the Senior
Notes. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears. Dutch tax law does provide for interest
deduction restrictions with respect to third-party debt taken up by the Issuer, the proceeds of which are used to grant
interest-bearing loans. Interest payments to the holders of the Notes are not subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax.

In 2019 and in accordance with the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, the Netherlands introduced an interest
deductibility limitation rule effective from January 1, 2019 (the “Dutch Fiscal EBITDA Rule”). Under the Dutch Fiscal
EBITDA Rule, net interest due in excess of 20% of the Issuer’s Dutch tax EBITDA is not deductible in that calendar
year. Net interest due means interest income minus interest expenses. If the Issuer is affected by the aforementioned
provision, the Issuer may no longer be able to (fully) deduct the interest expenses due to the holders of the Notes as a
result of which the Dutch corporate income tax burden may increase, until such time as interest is permitted to be
deducted in accordance with the Dutch Fiscal EBITDA Rule. The Dutch tax rate is currently 25.8% (a reduced rate
of 19% applies to the first €200,000 of taxable profit).

In addition, deemed interest payments to an affiliated (gelieerde) entity of the Issuer may be taxed with Dutch
withholding tax to a rate of 25.8% if the beneficiary (voordeelgerechtigde) of the payment is (i) an entity tax resident in
a low-tax jurisdiction or the benefit of the payment is attributable to an entity / permanent establishment in a low-tax
jurisdiction, or (ii) an entity not tax resident in a low-tax jurisdiction but established in a jurisdiction receiving the payment
with the aim to avoid taxation (subjective test) and the construction should be considered artificial (objective test), all
within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021). A jurisdiction is qualified as ‘lowtax’ if (i) the entity is not subject to tax or to a tax rate of less than 9%, or (ii) if the jurisdiction is included in the EU-list
of non-cooperative jurisdictions in the year of the payment.

**_Transfer pricing rules may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Certain of our subsidiaries have business relationships with other companies of the Group. Under certain
(corporate) income and trade tax law, such intra-group relationships are required to meet arm’s length terms. If intragroup relationships are not agreed on an arm’s length basis, certain tax authorities may in particular accept the
deduction of business expenses for tax purposes only to the extent the business expenses would have been incurred
in case of an arm’s length relationship. Under certain circumstances, intra-group performances that do not meet arm’s
length terms may also be re-qualified as deemed dividends. These consequences would negatively impact our financial
condition and results of operations.

42


-----

With respect to business relationships between companies of the Group established in different jurisdictions,
certain tax authorities may request proper transfer pricing documentation from the relevant Group company. Such transfer
pricing documentation may also be requested by certain tax authorities with respect to the allocation of profits between
companies of the Group established in different jurisdictions. If no proper transfer pricing documentation is delivered to
the tax authority in a timely manner upon such request, the tax authorities may adjust the taxable income of the relevant
company. In this case, an additional surcharge may also be applied by the tax authority.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no independent business operations and no material assets and will depend_**
**_on cash from its operating subsidiaries to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company and has no independent business operations or revenue-generating operations.
As of the Issue Date, the Issuer’s only material assets will be its equity interest in its subsidiaries. The Issuer’s ability to
make payments on or to refinance the Senior Secured Notes or other debt obligations will depend upon the availability of
cash on hand, the Group’s ability to generate and upstream cash from our operating subsidiaries to the Issuer and upon
the Group’s operating performance, which is affected by all the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We will only be able to pay interest, or principal, on the Senior Secured Notes
from funds received from the operating subsidiaries of the Group. Our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us
will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow and to upstream distributions to the Issuer in the
form of dividends. Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and we may decide not to, or be unable to,
declare a dividend. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture, as well as future debt, may
prevent or restrict our ability to upstream cash or to make distributions or payments of capital or income or use cash or
other assets to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes.
The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”) and the terms of existing and future debt of certain of the Group subsidiaries may also prohibit_
the payment of dividends or the making, or repayment, of loans or advances to the Issuer and restrict certain intra-group
payments.

In addition, the ability of the Issuers’ direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited
by the laws of the jurisdictions in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial assistance rules,
corporate benefit laws and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient of unlawful payments to
refund any amounts received. See “—The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability.” There can therefore be no assurance that there will be sufficient assets or income available_
to enable the Issuer to pay interest or principal on Senior Secured Notes and there can be no assurance that any of their
subsidiaries will be able to make distributions or other payments.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries and_**
**_effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. Unless a subsidiary is or becomes a
Guarantor, our subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes or to make
funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Senior Secured Notes or grant security interests in this respect.
Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing
agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made
available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or
dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

    - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) will
have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

    - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment
in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor,
as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the Senior Secured Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors). As of March 31, 2024, on a consolidated basis, excluding items such as trade payables, our
subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes (excluding the Issuer), had no third-party borrowings. The

43


-----

Indenture, subject to certain limitations, will permit these non-Guarantors to incur additional indebtedness, which may
also be secured.

**_The Issuers and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, and the sale_**
**_of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Security Documents will, subject to the terms of the Indenture, allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain
in possession of, retain control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture is occurring or would
result therefrom and subject to the restrictions in the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things,
without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral,
such as selling or otherwise disposing of such Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments
of indebtedness.

**_If a “Priority Facility” is introduced in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under such_**
**_facility, counterparties to certain hedging obligations and creditors under certain operating facilities could rank in_**
**_priority over the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, in the context of a debt refinancing, and upon the satisfaction of
certain conditions, the Group may introduce a “Priority Facility” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) which would
be entitled to rank in priority over the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement—Debt Refinancing.” Although the Intercreditor Agreement provides that such a Priority Facility cannot rank_
in priority to obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement without consent of the lenders thereunder, there is
no such protection for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, and a Priority Facility may rank in priority over the Senior
Secured Notes, including with respect to payments, ranking of security or the application of proceeds from the
enforcement of Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from
enforcement of the Collateral, with such enforcement proceeds required to be turned over to the Security Agent after
certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. If a Priority Facility is introduced that ranks in
priority to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral, the
Security Agent would be required to apply turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from
enforcement actions toward discharging any priority obligations (including the Priority Facility, certain operating
facilities and certain hedging obligations, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) in priority to
applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the
Collateral, investors may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such priority obligations
are greater than the proceeds recovered.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security. Such security is shared with the Senior Credit Facilities and may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations_**
**_under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. The Collateral has not been appraised by us or on our behalf._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement by
security interests in the Collateral, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement. To the extent that the claims against the Issuer exceed the value of the assets securing the Senior Secured
Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities and other obligations secured on a pari passu or priority basis with the Senior Secured
Notes, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of any of our other senior unsecured indebtedness,
including the Senior Notes, and those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are
paid.

The Collateral may also be released or otherwise reduced without the consent of holders in the future.
Particularly, there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient to enable
the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. We have not prepared any appraisals and no
appraisals have been prepared on our behalf of any of the Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured
Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes
may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests
over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market
and economic conditions, the condition of the specific market for the Collateral, the ability to sell the Collateral in an
orderly sale, the fair value and condition of the Collateral, the availability of buyers, the timing and manner of the sale,
whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, as applicable. Further,
there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant

44


-----

portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. In addition, the Collateral may also secure additional debt, to
the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, which may dilute the rights of holders
of the Senior Secured Notes to the Collateral.

The value of the Collateral may be subject to significant changes in value over time due to, among other factors,
economic or regulatory trends. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value
for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In
the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure investors that there will be a
market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation,
or that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral will be sufficient to pay the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, some or all of the Collateral may be of no value if the Group is subject to insolvency or
bankruptcy proceedings.

If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured
Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have
only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge
to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds
realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of
senior or pari passu security interests in the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes from time to time pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, whether on or after the date the Senior Secured Notes are first issued. The existence of any
such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral,
as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the priority of security
interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests in the Collateral are governed by the laws of various jurisdictions. The ability of the
Security Agent to enforce on the Collateral located in a particular jurisdiction or governed by the law of a particular
jurisdiction is subject to mandatory provisions of the law of such jurisdiction. Enforcement of the Collateral may also be
subject to certain statutory limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security Documents
designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements, all of which may limit its validity or enforceability.
For additional information relating to limitations on enforceability of Collateral and enforcement proceedings generally,
see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

The security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests over assets such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent
may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest, including, in some cases, certain regulatory
consents. We cannot assure investors that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent or that the consents
of any third parties will be given when required to enforce the Collateral. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have
the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may in the meantime significantly decrease.

In addition, to the extent that any other security interests permitted under the Indenture, and other rights
encumber the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, those parties may have and may exercise rights and remedies
with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent
to realize, sell or foreclose (in each case in accordance with the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement) on
such Collateral.

In addition, our business is subject to regulations and requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses.
Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with applicable regulations or requirements.
Particularly, the continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and that depend on the maintenance
of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted following a change in ownership in an enforcement scenario.
In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of such permits and licenses
may be prohibited or may require us or the acquired in an enforcement scenario to incur significant cost and expense.
Further, we cannot assure investors that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such
permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are practically or
commercially prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and

45


-----

the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_Enforcing rights as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes or under the Guarantees or the Collateral across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Netherlands; the Guarantors are organized under the laws of the
Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. Security interests to secure the Senior Secured Notes
and the Guarantees will be granted in Collateral located in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United
Kingdom. Such Collateral particularly includes a pledge over the shares of the Group, which is incorporated under the
laws of the Netherlands. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration, restructuring or similar event, proceedings
could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions or the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. An investor’s
rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Collateral and the Guarantees may therefore be subject to the laws of multiple
jurisdictions, materially affecting an investor’s ability to enforce effectively investor rights in multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and
costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, the insolvency, bankruptcy, foreign exchange, administrative and other laws of the jurisdictions of
organization of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and, in certain
circumstances, with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental
and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceedings and preference periods. The
application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws
of any particular jurisdiction should apply which could adversely affect an investor’s ability to enforce its rights under
the Guarantees and the Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that an investor may receive.
Furthermore, pursuant to EU Council Regulation No. 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings, the court which shall have
jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than
Denmark) where the company has its “center of main interests.” Therefore, to the extent that the “center of main interests”
of the Issuer or a Guarantor is deemed to be in a particular EU member state, the courts of such EU member state may
have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of such Issuer or Guarantor. For a description of certain aspects of
insolvency law, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations.”_

**_The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and_**
**_may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors’ obligations and the security interests granted in respect of the Senior Secured Notes are, or will
be, subject to certain restrictions to comply with the laws of the Netherlands, Germany, the United States and the United
Kingdom. Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Senior Secured Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Senior Secured Notes by
granting security under the relevant Security Documents. The Indenture will provide for general limitation language to
the effect that each Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability or indemnification
under a Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by the relevant
Guarantor or security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of the Guarantor or security provider
without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable laws and
enforcement of each Guarantee or security interest would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws
and defenses include those that relate to corporate purpose of benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, insolvency or
bankruptcy challenges, voidable preference, financial assistance, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Security Interests and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for a description of certain of these limitations in_
several relevant jurisdictions.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a
court could subordinate or void the Guarantees or the security interest granted under the Security Documents and, if
payment had already been made under a Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document, require
that the recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, as the case may be, if the court found
that:

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the relevant
Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

  - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security provider or, in certain jurisdictions, even

46


-----

when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent when it granted the
relevant Guarantee or security interest;

  - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the
relevant Guarantee or security interest and the Guarantor or security provider was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee or security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized
because of the relevant Guarantee or Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would
incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or

  - the relevant Guarantees or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects or corporate purposes
of the Guarantor or security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the
Guarantor or security provider.

If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no liability or decreased
liability under their respective Guarantees or the security interest in the Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable
depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law.

**_The security interest in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes and certain of the Collateral will be granted subsequent to the issuance of the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law. The holders of the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes will not
be granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The
Indenture will provide, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the
Security Documents. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct
the Security Agent to take enforcement action and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will generally not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the applicable
provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral may be subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale
through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain
jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes that are not identified as registered
holders in a security document will be validly secured.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other case law governing the creation and perfection of security
interests and enforceability of such security interests, the Collateral may secure a so-called “parallel debt” (the “Parallel
**Debt”) obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Indenture in favor of the Security Agent as well**
as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used
where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security
interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such
as novation, may adversely impact the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt will discharge the corresponding Principal
Obligations.

_The Netherlands_

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security rights can be granted to a party other than the creditor of
the claim or claims which are purported to be secured by such security rights. As a consequence, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides for the creation of Parallel Debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the Principal
Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and other secured parties under
or in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Dutch law security rights will be granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will, in
principle, not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge

47


-----

the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations.

As a result of the security rights being granted in favor of the Security Agent to secure the Parallel Debt, the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in
respect of such security except through the Security Agent. As a result, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes bear some
risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt structure
has not been tested under Dutch law and, to the extent that the security rights in the collateral created to secure the Parallel
Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not (directly) receive any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security rights in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the
risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the direct beneficiary of the “parallel
debt.”

_Germany_

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests (akzessorische Sicherheiten) such as rights of pledges
(Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor are the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on
behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Senior Secured Notes from time to time will
not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to benefit from a
secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of Parallel Debt obligations in favor of the Security
Agent mirroring the Principal Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. The “parallel debt” will
at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as such principal obligations. Any payment in respect of
the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding “parallel debt” and any payment in respect of the Parallel
Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The pledges governed by German law will directly secure
only the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the other obligations under or in connection with the Notes.

The “parallel debt” mechanism is not generally recognized by German courts and to the extent that the Notes or
the “parallel debt” mechanism in relation to the German law pledges (Pfandrechte) are successfully challenged by other
parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the German law pledges
(Pfandrechte).

Additionally, with respect to pledged assets under German law, German law does not generally permit for an
appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event. An enforcement of a pledge
governed by German law (such as, in particular, any pledges over shares in any German Guarantor) usually requires the
sale of the relevant collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public auction. Certain waiting periods and
notice requirements may apply to such disposal process. Thus, the disposal of pledged assets under German law will be
subject to statutory restrictions and may be delayed.

_England and Wales_

The creditors of the Senior Secured Notes will not have the ability to direct the Security Agent to appoint an
administrative receiver or an administrator out of court in an English insolvency proceeding because there will not be a
qualifying floating charge (meaning a floating charge over all or substantially all of the Collateral provider’s assets)
granted as part of the security for the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. Unless the security for the Senior Secured
Notes can be enforced as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No.
2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “FCARs”), the inability of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to direct the
appointment of an administrator out of court could further delay the enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.

In addition, the security interest of the Security Agent will be subject to practical considerations generally
associated with the realization of security interests. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent or
approval of a third party or governmental authority to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract or permit or transfer
or sell certain assets. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent or approval within a reasonable time
or at all. In addition, the consents and approval of third parties and governmental authorities may not be given when
required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose
upon those assets and the value of the security may significantly decrease.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_will be released automatically, without investor consent or any action on the part of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be released automatically, as described under

48


-----

“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral may be released and retaken in connection with the
refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes, if the Issuer has confirmed in writing to the
Security Agent that it has determined that it is either not possible or not desirable to implement any such refinancing on
terms satisfactory to the Issuer by instead granting additional collateral and/or amending the terms of the existing
Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, such a release and retaking of collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening
period” in respect of such collateral. See “The granting of security interests in the Collateral, or the incurrence of
_permitted debt in the future, may create hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law_
_applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could
challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of the Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially
limit an investor’s recovery in respect of the Collateral and thus reduce recovery under the Senior Secured Notes. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_

Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of certain collateral in
case of a subsequent over-collateralization (nachträgliche Übersicherung) (where the value of the relevant security
interest subsequently significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security
interest can even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive over-collateralization (anfängliche Übersicherung). It is
a factual question whether the security granted under the Collateral exceeds this limit.

**_Upon an IPO Pushdown, certain material Collateral and Guarantees may be released, any retaken Collateral may be_**
**_subject to hardening periods, and U.S. holders may have U.S. federal income tax consequences._**

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture will provide, that, on, in contemplation of, or
following an IPO Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), among other things, references to the Issuer and the
restricted subsidiaries (and all related provisions) in the Indenture shall apply only to the IPO Entity (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) and its restricted subsidiaries from time to time. Upon such substitution, each holding company
of the IPO Entity will be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any security granted by any such holding company, and the Guarantees and any Collateral
provided by such entities will therefore be released, which could materially reduce the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

Moreover, we may elect to, but are under no obligation to, revoke or otherwise reverse an IPO Pushdown
undertaken in contemplation of an IPO Event, or to replace any Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant thereto, in the
event that such IPO Event is not consummated. To the extent that new security documents in respect of any Collateral to
be retaken are entered into, such Collateral may be subject to new hardening periods. In addition, the IPO Pushdown may
result in a deemed exchange of the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, depending upon the
specific circumstances of the IPO Pushdown, and may have material adverse tax consequences for U.S. holders.

For more information, see “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Release of Liens,” “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Guarantees,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Amended and Restated_
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—IPO_
_Pushdown.”_

**_On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only by the Initial Collateral. In addition, investor rights_**
**_in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only by the Initial Collateral. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Issue Date and in any event within 10 days from the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees will be secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, the Permitted
Collateral Liens and certain perfection requirements, by the Additional Collateral. There can be no assurance that we will
be successful in procuring the Additional Collateral within the time periods specified.

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security interest.
The security interest in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Senior Secured Notes if we
fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any such security interest.

Such failure may result in the invalidity of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Senior Secured

49


-----

Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes against third parties,
including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. To the extent
that the security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the Security
Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure,
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding. It should also be noted that the Security Agent shall be under no
obligation to perfect the Collateral or to monitor the perfection of any security interest.

For example, under Dutch law, a right of pledge over receivables can be created in two manners, by means of (i)
a disclosed right of pledge which is disclosed to the debtor, or (ii) an undisclosed right of pledge. A disclosed and
undisclosed right of pledge can both be created by means of a notarial deed or private deed non-notarial agreement. As a
general rule under Dutch law, disclosed rights of pledge are created in respect of, inter alia, account receivables, insurance
receivables, intercompany receivables and hedging receivables, while undisclosed rights of pledge are created in respect
of trade receivables. A disclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment a debtor receives a notification of such right
of pledge. An undisclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment that (a copy of) the agreement is submitted to the
Dutch tax authorities (Belastingdienst) if such agreement is executed as a private deed or perfected at the moment of
execution, if such agreement is executed as a notarial deed. For undisclosed rights of pledge over receivables, the relevant
debtor may validly discharge its obligations under the relevant pledged receivable by paying the pledgor. As soon as the
debtor is notified of the right of pledge, the debtor is only able to validly discharge its obligations by making payments to
the pledgee. Further, pursuant to the terms of certain security documents, actions for perfection of certain security interests
may only be undertaken following certain trigger events, such as notice of the occurrence of an event of default under the
Indenture that is continuing. See _“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and_
_Certain Insolvency Law considerations—The Netherlands.”_

**_The granting of security interests in the Collateral, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create_**
**_hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, the incurrence
of permitted debt in the future, or delayed perfection of certain security interests following certain trigger events under
the Security Documents, such as notice of the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture which is continuing,
may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. “Hardening periods” are the periods of
time following the granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance
with relevant laws.

The granting of shared security interests (including the security interests in the Collateral), including in
connection with any release and retake of such security interests, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness permitted
to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will
permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances, including
in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests
can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated, as applicable. In each such
case, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening
period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

With respect to Dutch law, transactions can in certain circumstances be returned to a bankruptcy estate or a
company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the
debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors before
the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest or provided a guarantee that was
either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the
delay is not considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the
debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for
recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during three or six months preceding the commencement of the
relevant Dutch insolvency proceedings. However, in certain situations, longer time limits apply and in others there are no
time limits. For more information, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—The Netherlands—Fraudulent Transfer / conveyance.”_

The Senior Secured Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns
by reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due
to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which
the investor measures the return on his investments because of economical, political and other factors over which we have

50


-----

no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor measures the return on his
investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of any of the Senior Secured Notes below their respective stated
coupon rates and could result in a loss to the respective investors when the return on the Senior Secured Notes is translated
into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on their investments. Investments in the Senior
Secured Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses,
if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**_The insolvency laws of the Netherlands or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of the Guarantors may not_**
**_be as favorable to investors as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes from_**
**_recovering payments due on the Senior Secured Notes._**

Investors’ rights under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and
administrative laws of several jurisdictions and investors may not be able to effectively enforce their rights in such
complex, multiple bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by Upfield B.V., which
is organized under the laws of the Netherlands, and may be guaranteed by entities formed or incorporated in the
Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency event,
proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom or in one or more
other jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are domiciled. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex
and costly and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of investor rights. The
bankruptcy laws of these jurisdictions may be less favorable to an investor’s interests as a creditor than the bankruptcy
laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction investors may be familiar with, including in respect of priority of
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the ability to influence proceedings and the duration thereof, and this
may limit an investor’s ability to receive payments due on the Senior Secured Notes. In the event that any one or more of
the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty,
it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would
be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors,
the ability to void preferential transfer and certain other transactions, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability
to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them,
could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect an investor’s ability to
enforce its rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any
amounts that investors may receive. In addition, in actions brought in countries outside of the United States, courts may
choose to apply their own law rather than the law of the State of New York, which governs the Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees. The application of foreign law may limit an investor’s ability to enforce its rights
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

See also “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations” for additional information on the insolvency laws of the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany_
and the United Kingdom.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and a majority of their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States,
and the Group’s business is partially conducted outside the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will
submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under
the Indenture, investors may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, investors may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S.
courts against them. Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors
may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. In addition, we cannot
assure that a Dutch, German or English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was
commenced in the Netherlands, Germany and England and Wales. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the Netherlands, Germany and the
United Kingdom. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in such countries of civil liabilities based upon U.S.
securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such countries. In addition, the enforcement in such countries
of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in any of the foregoing countries
would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such country on the
basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further information see “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer as required by the Indenture and certain transactions will not_**
**_require us to make a change of control offer._**

The Indenture will require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at 101% of their
principal amount upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “Change of Control.” In addition, the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement may also be accelerated under certain circumstances that constitute a change of control and a similar
requirement to make an offer to purchase applies to the Senior Notes.

If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure investors that we would have sufficient funds available
at such time, or that the Issuer would have sufficient funds, or have access to sufficient funds, to finance the repurchase
of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes. The Issuer’s failure to effect a change of control offer when required would
constitute an event of default under the Indenture. This could in turn trigger an event of default under the Senior Notes
Indenture, Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Change of Control.” Additionally, the repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to such an offer could_
cause a default under such other indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might
otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if at the time our consolidated
leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford investor protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect investors, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in
voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the
Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will
not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event
of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently, and upon after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes we will, have a significant amount of
outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of March 31, 2024, on an as adjusted basis to give effect
to the Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have outstanding indebtedness in the aggregate amount
of €5,768 million (equivalent) (excluding the principal amount of lease liabilities recognized by us under IFRS 16
(Leases)), with an additional €567 million of borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our
significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations, including, but not limited to:

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and our other
debt and liabilities;

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thus
reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, internal growth through working capital and
capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater financial
resources than we have;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and industry;

  - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

  - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

52


-----

  - limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and
increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Senior Secured Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness
and to fund acquisitions, working capital requirements, working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on
our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations
is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are
beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to
service our debt or to fund our future acquisitions or other working capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including indebtedness in connection
with any future acquisitions. The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture, and the
Indenture will, permit our subsidiaries to incur such debt, in each case, subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added
to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital
_Resources.”_

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur will be structurally
senior to the Senior Secured Notes if such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes and could be secured
or could mature prior to the Senior Secured Notes. The terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, and the terms of the Indenture will, permit us to incur future debt that may have substantially the same
covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement. Borrowings under debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the
Senior Secured Notes, may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. We may be unable to pay these
debts in such circumstances. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described herein.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants which limit our operating, strategic and financial flexibility and if we default_**
**_under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture contain, and the Indenture will contain,
covenants which impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to (in
each case, subject to customary exceptions and carve-outs):

  - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

  - pay dividends or make other distributions or purchase or reduce or redeem the Issuer’s stock;

  - make investments or other restricted payments;

  - enter into agreements that restrict the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

  - transfer or sell assets;

  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - create liens on assets to secure indebtedness;

  - impair security interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes; or

  - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s
assets.

These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market
conditions or regulatory developments or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example,
such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances,
restructure our organization or finance our capital needs or such acquisitions. Our ability to comply with these covenants
and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry

53


-----

conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the terms of the Indenture,
the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, which could result in an event of default under such
agreements. If the debt under the Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, their
respective guarantees or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets
may be insufficient to repay in full any or all of the Senior Secured Notes and our other debt. Borrowings under other
debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable
on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other
indebtedness then outstanding, including any or all of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.”_

**_A large part of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate, which could rise significantly, increasing our costs_**
**_and reducing our cash flow, or could otherwise be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes._**

We are, and following the Transactions will continue to be, exposed to the risks of fluctuations in interest rates.
A significant portion of our current debt, including facilities under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, is subject to
variable interest rates indexed, among other indices, to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). We may also enter
into additional indebtedness bearing floating rates of interest in the future. EURIBOR and/or any other floating interest
rate index applicable to such indebtedness could rise significantly in the future. In recent periods, interest rates continued
to increase significantly, correspondingly increasing our interest expense to the extent of the drawings under, or issuances
of, such debt bearing floating rates of interest. There can be no assurance that EURIBOR and similar benchmarks will
not continue to increase and thereby increase our interest expense.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, EURIBOR, LIBOR and
other interest rate indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” became the subject of recent and ongoing national,
international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Such reforms may cause benchmarks to perform
differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such
consequence could have a material adverse effect on our debt linked to such a benchmark, including the Senior Term
Facilities and Revolving Credit Facility, in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the EURIBOR benchmark are
changed in order to comply with the requirements of the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”).

Furthermore, such changes or reforms could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or
otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. In addition, any of the
international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could
increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark, including EURIBOR
and LIBOR, and complying with any such regulations or requirements, which could significantly increase our interest
expense.

**_If the Senior Secured Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable_**
**_security._**

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Optional Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who_
receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security at
an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The Senior Secured Notes may not become, or remain, listed on The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited._**

Although the Issuer will agree in the Indenture to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Senior
Secured Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted to trading thereon within a reasonable period after
the Issue Date and to maintain such listing as long as the Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure
that the Senior Secured Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and
the admission to trading thereon or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing or if the Issuer
determines that it will not maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Exchange,
provided that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain and maintain the listing of the Senior
Secured Notes on another recognized stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to
do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes as a result of listing on the Exchange
or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved
for listing or the delisting of the Senior Secured Notes from the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with
the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Senior Secured Notes in the secondary
market.

54

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Senior Secured Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Senior Secured Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurances can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.
A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Senior Secured Notes by
one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and
could adversely affect the value and trading of such Senior Secured Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in which case an investor’s ability to sell the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure investors as to:

  - the liquidity of any market in the Senior Secured Notes;

  - their ability to sell their Senior Secured Notes; or

  - the prices at which investors would be able to sell their Senior Secured Notes.

Future trading prices for the Senior Secured Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities
similar to the Senior Secured Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Senior Secured Notes may be adversely
affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in
prices. The trading market for the Senior Secured Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to
which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any
such disruption may have a negative effect on investors, as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes, regardless of our
prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the
Senior Secured Notes. If no active trading market develops, investors may not be able to resell their holding of the Senior
Secured Notes at a fair value, if at all.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact the
liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The transfer of the Senior Secured Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at which_**
**_they may be sold._**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be, and are not required to be, registered
under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered
or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act and any other applicable laws. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Senior Secured
Notes or the Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to
resell the Senior Secured Notes. It is the obligation of each investor to ensure that all offers and sales of such Senior
Secured Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing system to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through, or on behalf
of, a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) trade in book-entry form only.
Interests in the Senior Secured Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined under
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Definitive Registered Notes”), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only

55


-----

in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of such Senior
Secured Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder
of the Global Notes representing the Senior Secured Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owed on or
in respect of the Global Notes representing the Senior Secured Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold
book-entry interests in the Senior Secured Notes, representing the Global Notes and credited by such participants to
indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and
if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through
which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Senior Secured Notes under the
Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Senior Secured Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Senior Secured Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it
has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting
of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered
Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to
acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may
not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Senior Secured Notes. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and
_Form.”_

**Risks Relating to Ownership**

**_The interests of the Company’s principal shareholder may conflict with your interests._**

The interests of the Company’s principal shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests
as holders of the Notes. The Company is indirectly controlled by KKR. See “Principal Shareholders.” KKR is able to
appoint its board of directors and to determine corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, KKR has control
over decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the
approval of shareholders regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own
best interests. For example, KKR could vote to cause the Group to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain
material assets or distribute dividends, in each case, so long as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional
indebtedness would increase the Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce its ability
to generate net sales or, if the assets distributed or sold are Notes Collateral, could reduce the amount of the asset sale
proceeds available to repay the Notes, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Notes.

Additionally, KKR is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire
and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with the Group. KKR may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
available to us. So long as KKR continues to own a significant amount of the Company’s capital stock, even if such
amount is less than 50%, KKR will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. The
interests of KKR may not coincide with your interests.

**Overview**

We are a global leader in plant-based food, established in 2018, as a purpose-driven company with a clear vision:
“To make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and
good for our planet.”

We develop, produce, distribute and market plant-based dairy alternative products in over 100 countries across
four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses. Backed by a rich heritage and a global scale, we
are highly differentiated in the plant-based sector. Our reinvigorated iconic power brands reflect over 150 years of product
expertise and brand heritage and are trusted by consumers globally. Our scale, culture and capabilities, including extensive
food technology and innovation expertise, our community of dedicated “Upfielders,” consisting of our management team
and employees, and our 14 manufacturing facilities across five continents, provide a strong value proposition for our
customers and consumers, and ensure we are well positioned to advance the future of food.

Our products are marketed under a family of historic and iconic brands with strong recognition in their target
markets. Our products are made with natural and sustainably sourced ingredients. Our carefully selected ingredients come
from a diversified supply chain to minimize risk and environmental impact and maximize taste, functionality, health,
affordability and sustainability for our consumers.

Our operations are diversified across three regions, namely Europe, the Americas and AMEA. We hold
leadership positions in the global butter and spreads, and plant cheese segments, with leadership positions in creams in
Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets. We sell our products across these regions primarily through
retail channels, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and other outlets. In addition, through our
professional foodservice channel, we sell our products to commercial outlets, such as quick service restaurants, bakeries,
pizza and pasta outlets, hotels, catering and industrial kitchens, and to the social sector, such as educational institutions,
workplaces and hospitals.

During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, our net sales were €2,793 million, €3,375 million
and €3,275 million, respectively. During the same periods, our operating profit was €288 million, €453 million and €570
million, and our Normalized EBITDA was €666 million, €749 million and €831 million, respectively. During the twelve
months ended March 31, 2024, our net sales were €3,209 million, our operating profit was €604 million and Normalized
EBITDA was €862 million.

**_Our Successful Transformation_**

Following the acquisition of our business by KKR in 2018, we began a journey to separate, transform and
reinvent our business, building on our existing strong foundations: a global platform with iconic power brands and worldclass knowledge.

Our journey took more than four years, with the wholescale transformational part of our journey completed in
2022. To become an independent business, we focused on separating and stabilizing our business, simplifying, renovating
and innovating our product portfolio, expanding into new product categories, investing in R&D through the opening of a

62


-----

new Food Science Centre, optimizing our supply chain, building an end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled
platform and building a new IT infrastructure. See “Business—History” for a detailed description of our transformation
journey.

Building on our existing strong foundations and as a result of the significant industrial, digital and cultural
transformation undertaken since 2018, we believe we are well positioned to advance the future of food.

**Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Fluctuations in Exchange Rates_**

We operate internationally and, as a result, are exposed to changes in various currency exchange rates. We have
exchange rate exposure in our key markets particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling,
the Polish zloty, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Indonesian rupiah and the Turkish lira, in each case against
the euro, which is the Group’s reporting currency. As a consequence, we have considerable cash flow, revenue, costs,
assets and liabilities in foreign currencies. Our exposure to changes in exchange rates has affected our results of operations
for the periods under presentation, and can mainly be described in terms of translation exposure and transaction exposure
affecting the comparability of results. For instance, the significant Turkish lira depreciation was one of the main
contributors in the decline of net sales in AMEA, as reported in euro, for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition,
the euro to pound sterling and the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates have been volatile for the periods under presentation
due to various factors including the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle-East, Brexit and partially the COVID-19
pandemic. As a result, we also present certain metrics, such as our net sales growth, gross profit growth, operating profit
growth and Normalized EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis, such that these metrics are calculated by excluding
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and both the current and prior periods local currency values are translated into
euro using prior year average exchange rates. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and “Summary—
_Summary Historical and Other Financial Information.”_

_Translation Exposure_

Translation exposure describes the risk of impact that exchange rates could have on the value of sales, costs,
assets and liabilities reported in euro on our consolidated income statement and balance sheet. For example, a weakening
of the euro against the U.S. dollar will result in an increase in net sales as reported in euro and, conversely, the
strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar will result in a decrease in net sales as reported in euro. As 25.7% and
25.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively,
comes from the United States, these effects may be significant. We are primarily subject to translation effects with respect
to non-euro revenues, costs and liabilities, as well as, non-euro goodwill and intangible assets.

_Transaction Exposure_

Our exchange rate transaction risks principally relate to purchases of raw materials including Plant Oils, which
may have underlying global commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollar or may have a degree of correlation
with the U.S. dollar (despite underlying indexes being priced in euro or other currencies). We are exposed to a transaction
risk since such U.S. dollar denominated raw materials are mainly invoiced to us in euro. Other ingredient and packaging
costs (apart from certain commodity inputs) are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the jurisdictions in
which our operations (including manufacturing plants and distribution hubs) are located, which in most cases correlate to
the markets and currencies in which sales are made. To hedge against foreign currency risk, we use forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps. We also manage our foreign currency risk by
implementing the natural hedge of incurring indebtedness in the various principal currencies in which our turnover is
denominated. As a result, we have debt service obligations denominated in U.S. dollars, pound sterling, polish zloty and
euro. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are exposed to foreign exchange rate
_risks and such may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.”_

**_Hyperinflationary Economies_**

As the cumulative inflation in Turkey over the past three years has exceeded 100%, we applied hyperinflationary
accounting under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies for the years ended December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024. IAS 29 requires that the results of our Turkish
subsidiary be reported as if these were hyperinflationary as of January 1, 2022. The application of IAS 29 includes: (i)
adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing power caused by inflation
from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date, (ii) adjustment of the statement of profit or loss for inflation
during the reporting period, (iii) the statement of profit or loss is translated at the period-end foreign exchange rate instead

63


-----

of an average rate and (iv) adjustment of the statement of profit or loss to reflect the impact of inflation and exchange rate
movement on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency. As a result, a net monetary loss of €4 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2024 and of €4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as compared to nil for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 and €7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively) for Turkey
has been recognized in net finance costs in our consolidated statement of profit or loss.

**Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

Our operating results are affected by a combination of economic, regulatory, industry-specific and companyspecific factors. The following is a description of the key factors affecting our results of operations in prior periods and
which are expected to affect our results going forward.

**_Input Prices_**

The principal ingredient in our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses are refined
Plant Oils. Aside from Plant Oils, additional key inputs used in our production process include other natural ingredients,
packaging materials and utility inputs such as water and energy. We obtain substantially all of our materials (which
includes Plant Oils, other ingredients, flavors, finished goods from third-party manufacturers and packaging materials)
from third-party suppliers, with the cost of these materials representing 67% and 68% of our total cost of sales for the
year ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively.

Plant Oils and other ingredients prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. In
particular, price volatility has increased since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic with prices remaining relatively high
compared to pre-pandemic levels, as well as due to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle
East. Although we do not source sunflower oil from Ukraine directly, as Ukraine is the world’s biggest exporter of
sunflower oil, beginning the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the war in Ukraine caused a global
shortage of sunflower oil, which in turn led to a rise in the price of sunflower oil during the year ended December 31,
2022. In response to potential sunflower oil supply chain disruptions, we utilized our “Blendflex” capability, that allows
us to substitute and swap ingredients within our Plant Butters and Spreads, such as switching sunflower oil for rapeseed
oil, without any impact on the taste, texture or functionality of our products. However, sunflower oil remains an important
ingredient for our product portfolio. The increase in sunflower oil prices has also had a knock-on effect on the prices of
other Plant Oils, including palm, rapeseed and soybean oil. In addition, palm oil has witnessed significant price swings in
recent years, resulting in historically high prices during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly due
to slower production by the main producer nations and the adoption of a domestic market obligation policy by Indonesia,
which is the world’s largest palm oil producer, in February 2022. Under the domestic market obligation policy, producers
had to set aside 450,000 tonnes a month of their shipments for local buyers. This was followed by an export ban in late
April 2022. Although the ban was lifted three weeks later, it created significant uncertainty in the market. Effective from
May 2023, Indonesia agreed on lowering its mandatory domestic sales threshold for palm oil producers from 450,000 to
300,000 tonnes a month, allowing for more export, however volatility in the palm oil market has persisted.

Other factors which have impacted the prices of Plant Oils, include their growing use as biofuel and the impact
of weather patterns, in particular, El Niño (a climate pattern that is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern
Pacific rise 0.5 degrees Celsius. El Niño has now returned and is expected to last at least through the first half of 2024,
according to the latest United Nations forecasts. Historically, times of El Niño have generally seen a decline in Plant Oils
production growth.

In addition to significant volatility in Plant Oils prices, recent periods have also seen a significant surge in energy
and transportation prices, as well as the supply chain interruptions, caused by recent geopolitical and other events,
including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and the COVID-19 pandemic. In
particular, our inputs suppliers’ cost base has seen an adverse impact in recent periods, which they have subsequently
sought to pass on to us. For example, because of the energy intensive nature of the refinery process to turn crude oils into
refined oils, our Plant Oils suppliers have sought to pass on their heightened energy costs to us. All of this has exposed
us in turn to significantly higher Plant Oils, packaging, energy costs, and as a consequence thereof, higher manufacturing,
logistics and transportation costs, which we may not be able to effectively hedge or fully pass on to our customers.

To manage our input costs, we regularly monitor global market prices and enter into a combination of fixed
contracts and commodity derivatives to protect against volatility. With this approach, through a combination of hedging
and fixed price contracts, we generally had price visibility on approximately 77% of our total cost of sales on a rolling
six month basis, or 49% of our total cost of sales on a rolling 12 month basis, in each case as of March 31, 2024. We use
commodity derivatives (futures, over the counter and tradable forward contracts) to hedge against commodity price risk
in respect of the major Plant Oils we purchase, as well as certain packaging materials and utilities. Our policy is to hedge

64


-----

the majority of the risk within the relevant pricing window. The extent of hedging is determined on an ongoing and on a
country and/or region basis, depending on hedging volumes and the pricing horizon. Our hedging ratio increases when
the exposure/volatility is higher and the pricing window is shorter. All of our commodity derivative contracts hedge future
purchases of Plant Oils, certain packaging materials and utilities on a three to six months rolling basis. This hedging
policy allows us to weather short term price movements and gives our sales teams time to price accordingly, taking into
account the typical cycle of customer negotiation windows (typically, annually and semi-annually in Europe and North
America, and less then semi-annually in LatAm and AMEA). Our hedging policy is implemented by our in-house
commodity risk management team, and while we do not take speculative views on the market, we monitor our position
regularly in line with our in-house team’s assessment. While we generally operate within this policy, in circumstances
where it is recommended by our specialist commodity risk management team and approved by our executive risk
committee, which consists of senior members of management, we can take longer hedging positions in exceptional
circumstances. Due to our Plant Oils inventories and hedging arrangements, a change in the cost of our Plant Oils can
take between three to six months to be fully realized in our cost of sales.

In response to the significant inflation experienced across our primary inputs in Plant Oils, packaging materials,
energy, manufacturing and logistics over the reporting period, particularly in 2021 and 2022, we also increased our pricing
through a number of pricing waves, with the last such pricing wave implemented in July 2022. We typically seek to
negotiate our pricing with our customers in Europe and North America on an annual basis, and we do so in LatAm and
AMEA on a semi-annual or more ad-hoc basis, depending on the increase in cost base and the relationship with retailers
and distributors in such market. In addition, with a view to maintaining our profitability and margins, which were impacted
as a result of such inflation, we continued other value protection measures such as our value creation program, which
focuses on making our business more efficient from an operational perspective and in particular through supply chain
areas including, amongst others, procurement, manufacturing and portfolio simplification. Pursuant to the value creation
program, we achieved approximately €90 million of savings measured at constant currency, representing 4.4% of our cost
of sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since the inception of Upfield in July 2018, we have achieved a total of
approximately €415 million in savings measured at constant currency through our value creation program and similar
initiatives. The continued recovery of our margin throughout 2022 and 2023 reflects the time lag between the
implementation of our pricing initiatives (particularly during the year ended December 31, 2022) and the impact of
inflation across our key inputs. Inflationary pressures have persisted throughout 2022 and 2023, and we remain exposed
to fluctuations in the prices of our key inputs. Our ability to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations through the pricing
of our products will need to be balanced against competitive dynamics in our various regions. See also “—Quantitative
_and Qualitative Disclosures about Liquidity Risk, Credit Risk and Market Risk—Market Risk.“_

**_Changes in Food Trends and Consumer Preferences_**

There are a number of changing consumer trends, demands and preferences which have an effect on both our
Group and the industry in which we operate. These include, dietary, health and environmental concerns and trends, such
as increasing awareness of different nutritional aspects of foods and the health effects and sourcing practices relating to
specific ingredients, an increasing preference for dairy-free, vegan and organic food ingredients, trends towards eating
and baking outside of home and concerns regarding public health consequences associated with obesity and increasing
awareness of the environmental and social effects of production (in particular those related to palm oil, which is a key
ingredient in many products across our portfolio). The food industry, particularly in developed markets and with respect
to unhealthier foods and high-fat, sweet and salty options, could also face a softer demand in the coming years because
of obesity medicines decreasing appetite and reducing daily calorie intake. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Business and Industry—Changes in food trends and consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on our_
_results of operations.”_

Currently there is an increasing trend of consumers across markets preferring non-dairy plant-based products as
a result of the increasing awareness of lactose-intolerance health issues, high carbon footprint and the environmental
impact of dairy consumption. Consumers are increasingly prioritizing environmentally friendly product choices due to
heightened concerns about climate change, with plant-based options being favored for their lower CO₂ emissions,
reduced resource consumption, and longer shelf life. Environmentally friendly packaging is also gaining importance,
with a preference for all-paper solutions to reduce plastic usage. With initiatives like the world’s first plastic-free,
recyclable tub for our Flora Plant brand and patented palm-oil free products, we believe that our product offering
strongly aligns with these consumer trends. In the dairy category, health-conscious consumers are also increasingly
turning to low-cholesterol, trans-fat-free options like our plant-based products. For example, our Plant Butter and
Spreads have a number of health and environmental advantages over dairy butter, such as higher Omega 3 and 6 fatty
acid concentrations, zero trans-fat and lower saturated fat content. See also “Industry—Key Trends.”

However, this growing trend towards plant-based alternatives may be adversely impacted by a number of factors,
such as misconceptions about “highly processed” plant-based foods, perceived “naturalness” of dairy and increased

65


-----

regulatory control of the plant-based sector. In addition, there has been negative press coverage in recent years as regards
products made from palm oil due to both health and environmental concerns. For example, among our key markets, Spain
and the Netherlands in particular, have seen a greater negative press coverage and perception as regards use of palm oil
based products. In response thereto, we created a patented palm oil-free technology and we have shifted our focus on
offering alternatives to palm oil in some of our markets. Although we source certified (segregated and mass balance) palm
oil and offer palm oil-free options in a number of markets, there is a risk that additional press coverage and the resulting
negative consumer perception of products made from palm oil further escalates. Although we recognize the controversy
around palm oil as an ingredient and continue to innovate and create new recipes both with sustainable palm oil and
alternatives to palm oil through our patented palm oil-free technology, some of our products contain palm oil and
switching to exclusively palm oil-free products may not be currently technically feasible.

In addition, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the conflict in the Middle East, the
global markets and economy have experienced significant uncertainty. There has been a sharp rise in energy and food
costs, resulting in inflationary macroeconomic conditions across most major economies and markets where we operate.
Given these economic conditions, there has been a significant decline in disposable incomes of many households, creating
a cost of living crisis, that has altered the purchasing habits of consumers. In these circumstances, consumers may choose
to economize by purchasing non-branded or private–label brands, which may be cheaper than our products. A reduction
in consumer disposable income could foster a move by our customers towards discounters and non-branded products,
which would impact our market share and adversely affect our net sales.

Aside from affecting our net sales, lower sales volumes also reduce the rate of cost absorption, meaning that in
periods where key input costs are higher, margins are adversely impacted to a greater degree than would otherwise be the
case. We have consistently operated with a clear approach to fluctuations in commodity and packaging costs in regards
to procurement and hedging policies and, as a result, have been able to maintain strong levels of profitability after direct
costs in changing cost environments. Moreover, our ability to effectively leverage our product development expertise to
continually update our portfolio in response to changing consumer tastes, especially with the development of innovative
premium products, is a key element of our strategy.

**_Customer Pricing_**

“Customer pricing” refer to prices that we charge to retailers. We do not set the prices that retailers charge to
end-use consumers.

The prices paid by our customers for our products are a key driver of our financial results and are affected by a
number of external factors. Pricing is mostly driven by the terms we agree with our major retail customers. We typically
conduct annual negotiations with most of our large retail customers in key markets in Europe and North America in
respect of the supply and pricing of our products in the first quarter of the year. Negotiations in AMEA and LatAm can
take place semi-annually or more frequently in some cases. These agreements, often referred to as “joint business plans,”
usually encompass pricing, trade terms, support for new innovation, assortment, distribution and shelf space. In some
markets, the agreements also include promotional activity for the year, although in most markets it is still possible to
change promotional activity and pricing during the year. In 2021 and 2022, on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic and
the associated supply chain disruption and the inflationary environment, these discussions took place on a more frequent
basis and in some cases pricing negotiations were prolonged. The impact of such prolonged negotiations saw us stop
shipments to certain customers during the discussions, which had an impact on financial performance during such period.
While there was no material lasting impact on financial performance, there can be no assurance that similar issues will
not arise in future years given the competitive dynamics of our industry. In territories where resale price maintenance is
not permitted, retailers remain free at all times to set levels of retail pricing, which depends on a number of factors,
including retailer margin, demand for our products among consumers and the relative affordability of our products as
compared to competing products (which may be particularly relevant given the ongoing cost of living crisis in a number
of markets where we offer our products). In particular, the consumer prices of and demand for our Plant Butter and
Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses products may also be influenced by a substitution effect with the market
price of competing dairy products including butter, cream and cheese. Butter price increased significantly between 2021
and 2023, driven by factors including higher costs of energy and fertilisers, which we believe has had a positive effect on
the relative prices of our products.

**_Seasonality_**

Our sales have historically been affected by seasonal cyclicality in customer orders in various markets. The
extent and impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which we operate. For example, the U.S.
business typically experiences a spike in the fourth quarter of the year which is driven by Thanksgiving and Christmas
baking. Similarly, there can be some seasonality in sales in Europe and the Americas owing to Easter, which can occur

66


-----

during the first or second quarter of the year. Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak in butter and spreads usage for cooking
and baking during the Ramadan festival season, which can occur in various quarters from year to year. Furthermore,
across all the countries in which we operate, the timing of product promotions drives volatility from normal consumption.
While our sales are seasonal, many of our costs, such as personnel costs, are incurred more evenly throughout the year,
which could affect measures of profitability in the short term and put pressure on our working capital position. In addition,
for these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a reliable indication of the performance of our business
or how we may perform in the future.

**Explanation of Certain Income Statement Items**

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales comprise sales of goods (across our core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses)
after the deduction of discounts, sales taxes and estimated returns. It does not include sales between Group companies.
Discounts given by the Group include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers and promotional
couponing. Net sales from contracts with customers is recognized when control of the goods or services is transferred to
the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. Transfer of control is generally on delivery to the customer but depending on individual customer
terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. Payment of the transaction price
is due immediately at the point where control passes to the customer. For the periods under presentation, net sales also
included royalty income from external customers.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales includes raw and packaging material costs, cost of conversion (including the depreciation of related
fixed assets), logistics and warehousing costs, business waste and other supply chain costs. In particular, other supply
chain costs, or supply chain overheads, includes expenses relating to supply chain personnel that are not reported under
production, logistics or warehousing expenses, such as demand and supply planning personnel, quality assurance
personnel and supply chain leadership.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses include (i) advertising and promotion expenses, (ii) certain research
and development costs, which are not capitalized in our statement of financial position data, (iii) indirect central costs and
(iv) general corporate expenses, as further discussed below:

    - advertising and promotion expenses include: (i) advertising expenses (including media spend on traditional
and digital media spots, as well as agency fees and production costs for traditional and digital media), (ii)
promotional expenses (including the costs of promotion packs and samples, communication material and
promotion agency costs) and (iii) point of sale investment (including costs of third-party merchandisers and
point of sale materials);

    - research and development costs primarily relate to the maintenance and expansion of our research and
development facilities as well as certain salary and materials expenses. Expenditures for research activities
are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Expenditures incurred during the
development phase of an internal project are capitalized in our statement of financial position data, if the
following conditions are met: (i) the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be
available for use or sale, (ii) the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it, (iii) the ability
to use or the intention to sell the intangible asset, (iv) how the intangible asset will generate probable future
economic benefits, (v) the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the
development and to use or sell the intangible asset and (vi) the ability to measure reliably the expenditure
attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

    - indirect central costs primarily relate to our sales force, merchandising activities, general management,
marketing teams and general marketing costs; and

    - general corporate and local market expenses primarily relate to the finance, legal, IT, HR, communications
and internal audit functions.

**_Net Finance Costs_**

Net finance costs are comprised of finance costs and finance income. Finance costs include interest costs in
relation to our financial liabilities (including in relation to the Existing Notes, the Senior Term Facilities, the Revolving
Credit Facility and the lease liabilities pursuant to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases), bank charges and fees, net
monetary loss arising from application of IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) and net foreign
currency exchange losses. The costs of issuing borrowings is expensed over the period as they accrue, based on the
effective interest method. Finance income includes interest income on cash and cash equivalents, interest income on
other financial assets and net foreign currency exchange gain.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Income tax expense comprises current income tax expense and deferred income tax expense. Income tax expense
is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or other
comprehensive income. Current income tax expense comprises the expected tax receivable/payable on the taxable income
or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments to tax
receivable/payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset if there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and if we intend to either settle on a net basis or to realize the asset
and settle the liability simultaneously. We operate in multiple jurisdictions which are subject to the application of complex
tax laws. Application of these complex tax laws may lead to uncertainties on tax positions. Management aims to resolve
these uncertainties in discussions with the tax authorities. When there is uncertainty over income tax treatments,
management is required to consider the effect of the uncertainty in determining taxable profit (tax loss), tax base, tax
losses and tax credits and tax rates.

**Segment Reporting**

Operating segments are based on geographical areas, which are Europe, the Americas and AMEA. So as to align
with our internal reporting and management structure, beginning the year ended December 31, 2022, we changed our
operating segments from “Developed Markets” and “Emerging Markets” to Europe, the Americas and AMEA. We review
the performance of segments based on the measures of net sales and Normalized EBIT, and resources are allocated
accordingly. Additionally, Normalized EBITDA is used by us within our internal reporting process. Global corporate
expenses are proportionately allocated to Europe, the Americas and AMEA based on net sales. The comparative segment
information for the year ended December 31, 2021 in our consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022, has been restated as if the operating segments were changed as of January 1, 2021.

**Results of Operations**

**_Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023_**

The following table sets forth our main operating results, extracted from our unaudited interim condensed
consolidated statement of profit or loss, for each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales decreased by €66 million, or 7.9%, from €839 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to
€773 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our organic net
sales declined by 6.3%.

Our organic net sales growth/(decrease), which we commenced calculating beginning the year ended December
31, 2023, presents a “like-for-like” comparative growth rate and represents the change in net sales for the current period
compared to the prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis and by eliminating any changes in scope between
the relevant periods. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” Our management believes that the drivers
of our organic net sales growth for the relevant periods (which are discussed below) were the key indicators as to the
underlying performance of our business. For the periods under discussion, the difference between our organic net sales
and reported net sales was primarily due to movements in foreign exchange, especially in the AMEA region, and changes
in scope in relation to the sale of our West Africa business in April 2023.

Our organic net sales decline of 6.3% was primarily pricing-led, with a negative pricing contribution of 5.1%,
and negative volume/mix contribution of 1.2%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our negative
pricing contribution reflects targeted price reductions on certain SKUs, primarily in Europe and the Americas. Our
negative volume/mix contribution of 1.2% showed an improving trend compared to the first, second and fourth quarter
of the year ended December 31, 2023.

Set forth below is a breakdown of our reported net sales, reported net sales decline, organic net sales
growth/(decrease), pricing contribution and volume/mix contribution by operating segments, in each case, for the three
months ended March 31, 2024, which are discussed in further detail:

_Europe_

Our net sales in Europe decreased by €34 million or 8.4% from €405 million for the three months ended March
31, 2023 to €371 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our
organic net sales in Europe declined by 9.1%.

Our organic net sales decline reflects a negative pricing contribution of 7.5% and a negative volume/mix
contribution of 1.6%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our negative pricing contribution reflects
targeted price reductions on certain SKUs in certain markets during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The negative
volume/mix contribution in Europe showed an improving trend compared to each of the prior quarters of the year ended
December 31, 2023, with some key markets in Europe including the Netherlands and Germany returning to volume
growth following targeted price reductions initiated during the year ended December 31, 2023. Positive volume/mix
contribution in the Netherlands was also supported by increased household penetration of plant-based butter under our
BlueBand brand, following the launch of our “Skip The Cow” campaign. The United Kingdom delivered a stable volume
performance with particularly strong performance in the Creams category. Volume growth in Austria was backed by our
Plant Butter and Spreads and Plant Creams, with the volume growth of our Plant Butter also supported by the rollout of
paper packaging under our Flora Plant brand.

_Americas_

Our net sales in Americas decreased by €18 million or 5.5% from €325 million for the three months ended March
31, 2023 to €307 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our
organic net sales in the Americas declined by 6.2%.

Our organic net sales decline reflects a negative pricing contribution of 3.7% and a negative volume/mix
contribution of 2.5%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our negative pricing contribution reflects
targeted price reductions on certain SKUs in certain markets. The negative volume/mix contribution in the Americas was
primarily due to some customer destocking in key markets in the Americas, including the United States, Canada and
Mexico during the three months ended March 31, 2024 which impacted volumes through the quarter, but all three markets
ended the period in volume growth. Volume growth in Colombia was mainly due to the growing market share of our
Rama brand in the country.

_AMEA_

Our net sales in AMEA decreased by €14 million or 12.8% from €109 million for the three months ended March
31, 2023 to €95 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Foreign exchange rate drove a large part of the
decline, with the Turkish lira depreciation as the main contributor, further strengthened by additional impacts from inscope changes. These in-scope changes principally reflected the sale of our West Africa business in April 2023. For the
three months ended March 31, 2024, our organic net sales growth in AMEA was 5.1%.

Our organic net sales growth in AMEA of 5.1% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 0.4% and a positive
volume/mix contribution of 4.7%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our positive pricing
contribution reflects the continued strong inflationary environment in Turkey, offset by targeted price reductions on
certain SKUs in other markets to address local competitive dynamics. The positive volume/mix contribution of 4.7% was
led by Turkey reflecting volume growth across our Plant Spreads and our Plant Creams, as well as volume growth in
Indonesia. Positive volume/mix contribution was also supported by steady performance from smaller, growth markets
including Australia, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region. Our foodservice business continues to perform strongly with a
broad-based positive volume/mix contribution across key and nascent growth markets, with particularly strong
performance in the creams category.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales decreased by €91 million, or 16.6%, from €548 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023
to €457 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was driven by a decline in the price of Plant
Oils, during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the prior period, and savings of €21 million in relation
to our value creation program.

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross profit increased by €25 million, or 8.6%, from €291 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023
to €316 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. On a constant currency basis, our gross profit increased by
9.3%, which is mainly attributable to the positive impact of a decrease in the price of Plant Oils, during the three months
ended March 31, 2024, and savings of €21 million pursuant to the value creation program, partially offset by targeted
price reductions.

**_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by €9 million, or 5.3%, from €171 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 to €162 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was driven by
a decrease in costs relating to non-underlying items from €13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €8
million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial
_Information—Key Financial Data.”_

**_Operating Profit_**

Operating profit increased by €34 million, or 28.3%, from €120 million for the three months ended March 31,
2023 to €154 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Alongside the gross profit drivers (as described above
under “—Gross Profit”), operating profit also benefited from the significant reduction in non-underlying costs, mainly
driven by reduced restructuring costs and costs relating to strategic initiatives.

**_Net Finance Costs_**

Net finance costs increased by €72 million, or 79.1% from €91 million for the three months ended March 31,
2023 to €163 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to higher interest
payments on the Senior Credit Facilities as a result of higher interest rates due to the increase in EURIBOR and similar
benchmarks, a net foreign exchange loss of €22 million and due to the fact that for the three months ended March 31,
2023, we benefited from a capital gain of €12 million with respect to the repayment of Polish zloty and pound sterling
denominated bank loans, with no corresponding capital gains benefit during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

**_Income Tax Expense_**

Taxation increased by €41 million from €28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €69 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was mainly related to our improved operational result for the
period, as well as the impact on non-recognized (deferred) tax assets relating to interest carry forward under the Dutch
Fiscal EBITDA Rule.

**_Net (Loss)/Profit_**

As a result of the foregoing factors, our net result decreased by €79 million, from a net profit of €1 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 to a loss of €78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

**_Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to year ended December 31, 2022_**

The following table sets forth our main operating results, extracted from our consolidated statement of profit or
loss, for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

_Net Sales_

Net sales decreased by €100 million, or 3.0%, from €3,375 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to
€3,275 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic net sales
growth was 1.2%.

As discussed above under “—Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March
_31, 2023,” our management believes that the drivers of our organic net sales growth/(decrease) which we commenced_
calculating beginning the year ended December 31, 2023 (and which are discussed below) were the key indicators as to
the underlying performance of our business for the relevant year as compared to the prior period. For the periods under
discussion, the difference between our organic net sales and reported net sales was primarily due to movements in foreign
exchange, especially in the AMEA region, and the impact from the change in scope in the AMEA region as discussed
below.

Our organic net sales growth of 1.2% was primarily pricing-led, with a positive pricing contribution of 6.5%,
partially offset by a negative volume/mix contribution of 5.3%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our
positive pricing contribution reflects the annualized impact of previously implemented price increases in the first half of
2023, as well as limited price and promotional reductions on certain SKUs in certain markets during the second half of

71


-----

the year ended December 31, 2023. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase
in our pricing, as well as certain product portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and certain other selfdirected initiatives implemented by us during the year which mainly impacted our organic net sales growth in Europe.
We implemented these initiatives so as to continue with our portfolio improvement and rationalization program to
improve our product offering to customers and consumers and further optimize our operations. On an underlying basis,
and excluding the impact of such product portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and certain other selfdirected initiatives, our volume/mix contribution was a negative 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023. However,
during the year ended December 31, 2023, our foodservice business contributed positively to our net sales.

Set forth below is a breakdown of our reported net sales, reported net sales growth/(decrease), organic net sales
growth/(decrease), pricing contribution, volume/mix contribution and underlying volume/mix contribution by operating
segments, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are discussed in further detail:

_Europe_

Our net sales in Europe decreased by €62 million or 3.7% from €1,661 million for the year ended December 31,
2022 to €1,599 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic net
sales in Europe declined by 3.4%.

Our organic net sales decline reflects a positive pricing contribution of 6.0%, offset by a negative volume/mix
contribution of 9.4%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the
annualized impact of previously implemented price increases (from the second half of 2022) in the first half of 2023, as
well as limited price reductions in certain markets, including the Netherlands, Germany and Poland in the second half of
2023. The decline in volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the strong competition from dairy players in key retail
markets in Europe, including the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. In addition, the product portfolio upgrade,
rationalization and renovation actions and other self-directed initiatives implemented by us during the year ended
December 31, 2023, were predominantly weighted towards Europe, which negatively impacted our volume/mix
performance in this region. During the year ended December 31, 2023, several key European markets delivered organic
net sales growth, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and Hungary.

On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization, renovation
and other self-directed initiatives, our volume/mix contribution in Europe was negative 4.7% for the year ended December
31, 2023. Overall, underlying volume/mix trends progressively improved across the year as strategic initiatives
implemented by us took effect and a significant portion of the price increases implemented by us was accepted in the
market. Our foodservice business, recorded a net sales growth in Europe led by key markets including Sweden, Poland,
Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.

_Americas_

Our net sales in Americas increased by €46 million or 3.6% from €1,273 million for the year ended December
31, 2022 to €1,319 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic
net sales growth in the Americas was 6.0%.

Our organic net sales growth in the Americas of 6.0% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 8.3%, partially
offset by a negative volume/mix contribution of 2.3%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our positive
pricing contribution reflects the annualized impact of previously implemented price increases (from the second half of
2022) in the first half of 2023, as well as limited price reductions in the second half of 2023 in certain markets, including
Mexico. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our pricing in key retail
markets in the Americas, including Canada and Mexico alongside some negative impact from our supply chain activities

in the Americas region, partially offset by positive volume/mix contribution in Colombia and Brazil. In addition, the
product portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and other self-directed initiatives implemented by us
during the year ended December 31, 2023, as discussed above, also negatively impacted our volume/mix performance in
this region.

On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization, renovation
and other self-directed initiatives discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in the Americas was a negative 1.6% for
the year ended December 31, 2023. In the United States, we recorded stable to growing volumes across all our key product
categories. In particular, our brands Country Crock and Imperial both gained share in the butters and spreads market,
while Violife further strengthened its market leadership position in the plant-based cheese market. Canada and Mexico
both recorded volume growth in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2023. Elsewhere in LatAm, volume
trends were more varied during the year ended December 31, 2023, with Brazil and Colombia recording volume growth.

_AMEA_

Our net sales in AMEA decreased by €84 million or 19.0% from €441 million for the year ended December 31,
2022 to €357 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Foreign exchange rate drove a large part of the decline, with
the Turkish lira depreciation as the main contributor, further strengthened by additional impact from scope changes. These
scope changes principally reflected the sale of our West Africa business in April 2023, alongside our business model
changes in Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Japan. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic net sales growth in
AMEA was 5.7%.

Our organic net sales growth in AMEA of 5.7% was relatively evenly split across both pricing and positive
volume/mix contribution, with a positive pricing contribution of 2.7% and a positive volume/mix contribution of 3.0%.
Our positive pricing contribution reflects the annualized impact of previously implemented price increases (from the
second half of 2022) in the first half of 2023, as well as limited price reductions in the second half of 2023 to address
competitive dynamics in certain markets, such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The positive volume/mix contribution was led
by Turkey and Indonesia, alongside volume growth in some of our smaller markets, such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
region. Our foodservice business showed continued growth led by Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, with
strong performance in the creams category.

On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization, renovation
and other self-directed initiatives, our volume/mix contribution in AMEA was 3.5% for the year ended December 31,
2023.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales decreased by €199 million, or 8.9%, from €2,228 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to
€2,029 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the price of Plant
Oils, during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the historically high prices of such Plant Oils during the
year ended December 31, 2022 and a negative volume/mix contribution of 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by €99 million, or 8.6%, from €1,147 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to
€1,246 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. On a constant currency basis, our gross profit increased by 10.6%,
which is mainly attributable to the positive impact of the pricing initiatives implemented by us and savings pursuant to
the value creation program, partially offset by continued inflation across both commodities (net of hedging) and other
costs of sales.

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by €77 million, or 10.2%, from €753 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022 to €676 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in non-underlying costs during the year ended December 31, 2023, including a decrease in supply chain
restructuring costs following the sale of our manufacturing facilities in Canada and the Netherlands in the year ended
December 31, 2022, as well as a decrease in impairment costs, partially offset by an increase in advertising and promotion
expenses and other overhead costs. Non-underlying costs are costs that relate to activities that are not considered to be
part of our daily business operations, due to the nature, frequency and predictability of their occurrence, including, but
not limited to, business transformation, corporate actions and strategic initiatives, restructuring costs and impairments.

_Other Income_

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold two manufacturing sites, one in Canada and one in the
Netherlands, as well as land in Greece. As a result hereof, we recognized a gain of €59 million as other income. No such
other income was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023.

_Operating Profit_

Operating profit increased by €117 million, or 25.8%, from €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
to €570 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Alongside the gross profit drivers (as described above under “—
_Gross Profit”), operating profit also benefited from the reduction in non-underlying costs, mainly driven by a reduction_
in restructuring costs and lower impairments.

_Net Finance Costs_

Net finance costs increased by €260 million, or 88.1% from €295 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
to €555 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in our finance cost. Our finance costs
increased by €232 million, or 65.9% from €352 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €584 million for the
year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i) the amendments to the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023, and pursuant to such amendments, we recognized an additional
€28 million of transaction costs and a loss of €37 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, (ii) higher interest payments
on the Senior Credit Facilities as a result of higher interest rates and (iii) a net foreign exchange gain of €44 million for
the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €16 million for the year ended December
31, 2023.

_Income Tax Expense_

Taxation increased by €41 million, or 51.3%, from €80 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €121
million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was mainly driven by improved operational results which led to an
increase in current year income tax expense, as well as an increase in non-recognition of deferred tax assets relating to
interest carry forward and foreign tax credits.

_Net (Loss)/Profit_

As a result of the foregoing factors, we reported a net loss of €106 million for the year ended December 31,
2023, as compared to a net profit of €78 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021**

_(Operating Profit) of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 included_
_in this Offering Memorandum._

**_Net Sales_**

Net sales increased by €582 million, or 20.8%, from €2,793 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€3,375 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant currency net
sales growth was 18.5%.

Our constant currency net sales growth represents the change in net sales for the relevant period compared to the
prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” Our
management believes for the periods under discussion, the drivers of our constant currency net sales growth (which are
discussed below) were the key indicators as to the underlying performance of our business. For the periods under
discussion, the difference between our constant currency net sales and reported net sales is due to movements in foreign
exchange, in particular the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro.

Our constant currency net sales growth of 18.5% was primarily pricing-led, with a positive pricing contribution
of 29.0%, partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 10.5%, in each case, for the year ended December 31,
2022. Our positive pricing contribution reflects (i) the impact of price increases we realized during the year ended
December 31, 2022, which involved a number of pricing waves implemented by us between 2021 and the second quarter
of 2022 (the last one being implemented in July 2022) and (ii) the impact of certain portfolio upgrade, rationalization and
renovation actions and other self-directed initiatives implemented by us during the year ended December 31, 2022,
whereby we removed certain unprofitable and low value-added products and replaced them with new product innovations.
Negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to (i) the impact on volume due to the increase in pricing, (ii) the
impact on volume due to certain portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions referred to above, (iii) the impact
of our net revenue management initiatives and (iv) the impact of price pack architecture actions; partially offset by the
positive impact on volumes due to limited price reductions which we implemented during the year ended December 31,
2022. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives,
our volume/mix contribution was negative at 6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Set forth below is a breakdown of our reported net sales, reported net sales growth, constant currency net sales
growth, pricing contribution, volume/mix contribution and underlying volume/mix contribution by operating segments,
in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are discussed in further detail:

_* Calculated by comparing with relevant data for the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Presentation of Financial and_

_Europe_

Our net sales in Europe increased by €223 million or 15.5% from €1,438 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €1,661 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant
currency net sales growth in Europe was 16.0%.

Our constant currency net sales growth in Europe of 16.0% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 26.0%,
partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 10.0%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our
positive pricing contribution reflects the impact of price increases we implemented during the year ended December 31,
2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, which were in response to the significant inflation experienced across our

75


-----

primary inputs. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the negative impact of the increase in our
pricing in key retail markets in Europe, especially in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and volume reduction
related to the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives implemented by us during the year ended December
31, 2022.

On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives
discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in Europe was a negative 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our
foodservice business recorded a strong net sales growth in Europe primarily due to growth in the United Kingdom, Spain
and Poland driven by additional customer contracts entered into by us.

_Americas_

Our net sales in Americas increased by €324 million or 34.1% from €949 million for the year ended December
31, 2021 to €1,273 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant
currency net sales growth in the Americas was 20.2%.

Our constant currency net sales growth in the Americas of 20.2% reflects a positive pricing contribution of
28.9%, partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 8.7%. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the impact
of price increases we implemented during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021,
which were in response to the significant inflation experienced across our primary inputs, particularly in the United States,
Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our
pricing in key retail markets in the Americas, including the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition, the product
portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives discussed above also negatively impacted our volume/mix performance
in this region.

On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives
discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in the Americas was a negative 8.5% for the year ended December 31,
2022. In the United States we continued to grow our share (based on value of sales) in the Butters and Spreads category,
primarily due to the continued strong performance of our brand Country Crock, our renovated portfolio, relatively stable
volumes and strong customer relationships. Across LatAm we experienced strong growth on a price-led basis, with
continued momentum in key markets such as Mexico, Brazil and Central America through 2022. Our brand Violife
consolidated its leadership position in the plant-based cheese category in the United States, gradually growing its share,
driven by the continued expansion of distribution to our key nationwide customers.

_AMEA_

Our net sales in AMEA increased by €35 million or 8.6% from €406 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 to €441 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant currency
net sales growth in AMEA was 23.1%.

Our constant currency net sales growth in AMEA of 23.1% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 39.7%,
partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 16.6%. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the impact of
price increases we implemented during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, which
were in response to the significant inflation experienced across our primary inputs. Positive pricing contribution across
the region was driven primarily by Turkey, South and Central Asia and Australia and New Zealand. The negative
volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our pricing, especially in Indonesia, and
volume reduction related to the portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives discussed above.

On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives
discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in AMEA was a negative 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Our foodservice business recorded a strong net sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 in AMEA and
continued to see positive growth momentum and stabilized its performance in the region following the disruption caused
due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €432 million, or 24.1%, from €1,796 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
to €2,228 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the significant increase in
the price of Plant Oils, reaching historically high prices during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cost
of sales was partially offset by savings of €86 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, pursuant to the value
creation program implemented by us.

76


-----

_Gross Profit_

Gross profit increased by €150 million, or 15.0%, from €997 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to
€1,147 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. On a constant currency basis, our gross profit increased by 12.4%,
which is mainly attributable to the positive impact of the pricing initiatives implemented by us and savings pursuant to
the value creation program, partially offset by continued inflation across both commodities (net of hedging) and other
cost of sales.

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by €44 million, or 6.2%, from €709 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to €753 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an
increase in advertising and promotion expenses and employee costs, partially offset by lower non-underlying costs during
the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 2021. Non-underlying costs are costs that
relate to activities that are not considered to be part of our daily business operations, due to the nature, frequency and
predictability of their occurrence, including, but not limited to, business transformation, corporate actions and strategic
initiatives, restructuring costs and impairments. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information—
_Key Financial Data” for details of the non-underlying costs incurred by us during the years ended December 31, 2021_
and 2022.

_Other Income_

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold two manufacturing sites, one in Canada and one in the
Netherlands, as well as land in Greece. As a result hereof, we recognized a gain of €59 million as other income. No such
other income was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Operating Profit_

Operating profit increased by €165 million, or 57.3%, from €288 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
to €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Alongside the gross profit drivers (as described above under “—
_Gross Profit”), operating profit also benefited from optimization of our selling, general and administrative expenses, as_
well as a reduction in non-underlying costs mainly driven by a reduction in restructuring and business transformation
costs.

_Net Finance Costs_

Net finance costs decreased by €23 million, or 7.2%, from €318 million for the year ended December 31, 2021
to €295 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of
€44 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €65 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by higher interest payments on the Senior Credit Facilities during the year
ended December 31, 2022, as a result of higher interest rates.

_Income Tax Expense_

Taxation decreased by €81 million, or 50.3%, from €161 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €80
million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreased non-recognition of deferred
tax assets, which relates to interest carry forward, foreign tax credits and net operating losses.

_Net Profit/(Loss)_

As a result of the foregoing factors, we reported a net profit of €78 million for the year ended December 31,
2022, as compared to a net loss of €191 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Liquidity_**

Liquidity describes our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business
operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and
other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by our cash from operating
activities, including our net negative working capital position, and our financings. Our principal liquidity requirements
arise from the need to settle supplier payables and fund our ongoing operations. During the periods under review, the

77


-----

liquidity needs of the business were mainly funded from cash from operations (including our net negative working capital
position) and borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility. Our business is cash
generative and during the periods under review we benefited from a negative cash conversion cycle, driven by longer
credit terms received on purchases from our suppliers compared to those offered to our customers.

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As
of March 31, 2024, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have outstanding €5,768 million
(equivalent) in aggregate indebtedness (excluding the principal amount of lease liabilities recognized by us under IFRS
16 (Leases)), with an additional €567 million of borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility.

To meet these additional liquidity needs going forward, we expect our sources of liquidity will consist mainly
of the following:

    - cash generated from our operating activities;

    - borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility;

    - issuances of debt securities; and

    - borrowings under other loan facilities.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings, will be
adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity needs, working capital requirements and debt service obligations for the next
twelve months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future
debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including
the Notes, or to fund all of our other projected liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

    - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which could be
due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole;

    - increased commodity costs which we cannot pass onto customers;

    - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings which bear interest at a variable rate,
including our Senior Term Facilities and our Revolving Credit Facility;

    - changes in trade terms, consumer preferences or market conditions which might imperil our ability to
maintain a net negative working capital position consistent with past practice; and

    - higher capital expenditure, such as due to higher than expected expenses incurred in connection with our
product innovation and growth strategies.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;

    - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

    - restructure or refinancing all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement,
limit, and the terms of the Notes, will limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future
debt.

_For Comparative Purposes) of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023_
_included in this Offering Memorandum._

_Net cash flow from operating activities_

Net cash from operating activities increased by €40 million, from €32 million for the three months ended March
31, 2023 to €72 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was mainly driven by the increase in operating
profit.

Net cash from operating activities increased by €19 million, or 3.2%, from €588 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €607 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was mainly driven by the increase in
operating profit during the period, partially offset by working capital effects and higher tax payments.

Net cash from operating activities increased by €32 million, or 5.8%, from €556 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €588 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was mainly driven by the increase in
operating profit during the period.

_Net Cash Used in Investing Activities_

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by €6 million, or 33.3%, from €18 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 to €12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was mainly driven by interest
income received by us, a deferred consideration of €1 million received in relation to the sale of our business in West
Africa on March 31, 2023 and the absence of equity investments during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by €48 million, or 60.0%, from €80 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €128 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by (i) higher net
capital expenditure as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, where we benefited from the sale of two
manufacturing sites (one in Canada and one in the Netherlands), as well as the sale of land in Greece, (ii) a payment of
€57 million of deferred contingent consideration to Arivia related to the consideration associated with the acquisition of
Arivia in January 2020 and (iii) share-based payments to Arivia employees through the cash settled equity incentive plan.
This increase was partially offset by a refund of VAT in Indonesia of €33 million.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by €12 million, or 17.6%, from €68 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €80 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was driven by a payment of €35
million of deferred contingent consideration to Arivia, related to the consideration associated with the acquisition of
Arivia in January 2020. The increase was partially offset by a VAT refund in Mexico of €30 million (excluding interest)
from a business acquisition, received during the year ended December 31, 2021.

_Net Cash Used in Financing Activities_

Net cash used in financing activities increased by €133 million, from €42 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 to €175 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which is mainly driven by higher interest

payments due to higher interest rates, repayments made by us and payment of certain refinancing fees, in each case, in
relation to the Senior Term Facilities and/or the Revolving Credit Facility.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by €120 million, or 24.2%, from €496 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 to €376 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to higher net
proceeds received by us under the Senior Term Facilities pursuant to a refinancing thereunder, which was partially offset
by higher interest payments due to higher interest rates pursuant to refinancing and the payment of certain refinancing
fees, in each case, in relation to the Senior Term Facilities.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by €150 million, or 23.2%, from €646 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 to €496 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by a lower
repayment on the Revolving Credit Facility compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as proceeds received
from the settlement of foreign exchange derivatives.

**_Changes in Working Capital_**

Our working capital consists of the sum of our inventory, trade receivables, other current receivables, trade
payables and other current liabilities. The Group benefits from a negative cash conversion cycle, driven by longer credit
terms received on purchases from its suppliers compared to those offered to its customers. Particularly in Europe and
North America, trade receivables are net of trade term rebates and trade payable days are significantly longer than
inventory and receivables days. Historically, we have managed our trade payables on typically 90 to 120 day terms and
managed our receivables on typically 30 day terms. We also offer additional discounts to customers in many markets for
“prompt payment,” which is defined as payment in less than 30 days. Our negative cash conversion largely is a structural
feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and finished product markets in which we operate,
and while there are some risks to our ability to maintain our working capital cycle on precisely these terms going forward
this cycle is not expected to shift fundamentally in the future. This cycle is also a result of our operational efficiency with
respect to our inventory management. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are
_subject to credit risk with respect to our customers and suppliers.”_

The change in working capital for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was an outflow of €114 million,
compared to an outflow of €117 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by a combination of typical
seasonal effects, deflationary effects on payables, alongside some timing impacts on receivables.

The change in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2023 was an outflow of €71 million, compared
to an inflow of €44 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The outflow in 2023 was driven by a decrease in
payables reflecting deflationary effects, the impact of commodity hedging, and, to a lesser extent, bonus impacts.

The change in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2022 was an inflow of €44 million, compared
to an inflow of €86 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. The lower inflow in 2022 was driven by a combination
of higher inventories, reflecting the decision to carry higher safety stocks, and higher receivables, reflecting inflationary
effects. The working capital inflow of €86 million for the year ended 2021 is as derived from our consolidated statement
of cash flows, and consists of a sum of inventories (negative €18 million), trade receivables (€73 million), other
receivables (€79 million), trade payables (€54 million) and other liabilities (negative €85 million), and, to align with the
presentation adopted by us for periods subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2021, further considering the outflow
for the increase in provisions for the year ended December 31, 2021 (€17 million).

**Analysis of Certain Consolidated Balance Sheet Items**

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value. Cost comprises direct costs
and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less all estimated
costs of completion necessary to make the sale. Our inventories are comprised of (i) raw materials and consumables, (ii)
work in progress, (iii) finished goods and goods for resale and (iv) engineering spare parts.

**_Trade and Current Receivables_**

Our trade receivables principally comprise payments due from customers for the supply of our products.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited as our customer base is large and diverse on a
global basis. As of December 31, 2023, we had over 2,590 customers across 56 subsidiaries with the top 50 customers

80


-----

accounting for approximately 48% of all the receivables outstanding. Not one of our individual customers had a
concentration of more than 4% of the outstanding trade receivable balance.

Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs
and subsequently measured at amortized cost. The fair values of trade and other current receivables are not considered to
be significantly different from their carrying values. We have a non-recourse factoring arrangement with a financial
institution. As part of the arrangement, we transfer our eligible trade receivables to the financial institution and receive
an initial part of the transferred receivables. The legal title and rights to the factored receivables have been passed to the
financial institution, therefore the control of the factored receivables has been transferred. The transferred receivables are
derecognized for the amount that is initially factored with the remaining amounts of the transferred receivables maintained
on our balance sheet. The financial institution charges a fixed service fee and interest based on utilization of the facility
which are included in finance costs.

**_Trade Payables and Other Current Liabilities_**

Trade payables comprise amounts due to creditors, principally for the supply of Plant Oils used in the
manufacture of our products, as well as packaging and distribution costs. Trade payables and other current liabilities are
recognized initially at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized
cost. The fair values of trade payables and other current liabilities are not considered to be significantly different from
their carrying values.

**Capital Expenditures**

Following our acquisition by KKR in 2018 and our transformation as a separate business, during the periods
presented, our capital expenditures have largely been devoted to the enhancement of production capacities across multiple
regions. In the short to medium term, we do not expect significant capital expenditure needs, and expect to incur ordinary
course maintenance capital expenditure and select investment capital expenditure to support certain key growth initiatives.
Such capital expenditures would exclude any impact on our financial statements pursuant to recognition of right of use
assets as lease liabilities under IFRS 16 (Leases).

**Financial Liabilities and Contractual Obligations**

**_Contractual Obligations_**

In addition to our indebtedness, we have major contractual relationships with our customers and in respect of
our supply chain. We enter into “joint business plans” with our major retailer customers which are year-long contractual
frameworks governing the supply of products to such retailers and the participation in joint promotional and periodic
discount activities with such major retailers. Precise volumes and prices of products supplied are not typically locked into
these contracts in advance. With respect to our supply chain, we enter into cash-settled hedging arrangements with
counterparties in the commodity markets to hedge pricing risks. We also enter into physical forwards and spot or nearspot supply contracts with a range of reputable, high-quality suppliers of Plant Oils and other essential inputs. We have a
small number of long-term supply contracts with raw materials suppliers, typically in situations where a long-term
contract helps such supplier mitigate start-up risks or ramp-up/ramp-down costs, thus improving the pricing terms
available to us. Finally, we are party to collective bargaining arrangements in respect of certain of our manufacturing
facilities.

The maturity profile of the aggregate principal amount of our loans and borrowings as of March 31, 2024, as
adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, is as below. The following tables excludes any future interest payment that we
would be required to make.

in respect of our Senior Notes is presented based on the aggregate principal amount outstanding rather than the carrying value of the Senior Notes
on our unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2024 and excludes €4.7 million of unamortized
financing fees in respect of our Senior Notes as of March 31, 2024. On or about the Issue Date, we intend to use a portion of the gross proceeds
from the Offering to redeem (i) $180,760,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Dollar Notes (converted from €167 million at an
exchange rate of $1.080 = €1.00, which represents the exchange rate used by us in our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024) and (ii) €232,575,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Euro Notes,
in each case, at par. Following the completion of such redemption, $306,640,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Dollar Notes and
€444,485,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Euro Notes, shall remain outstanding. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(4) Excludes €11 million of liabilities in relation to derivate financial instruments recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position data
as of March 31, 2024

**_Provisions_**

Restructuring provisions primarily include people costs such as redundancy costs and cost of compensation
where manufacturing, distribution or selling agreements are to be terminated. As at December 31, 2023, we have €1
million provisioned for in relation to restructuring costs.

**_Contingent Liabilities_**

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that are not probable or not reliably measurable. They may arise
in respect of litigation against Group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory or fiscal authorities and
obligations arising under environmental legislations. In many markets in which we operate, there is a high degree of
complexity involved in the local tax regimes, which could also result in contingent liabilities.

Since 2022, Upfield US Inc. (“Upfield US”), a Group company, has been named as a party in a series of alleged
putative class action lawsuits. For additional information, please see “Business—Litigation.” As of March 31, 2024, a
material loss exposure in respect of these proceedings is not probable or reliably estimable.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Liquidity Risk, Credit Risk and Market Risk**

The main risks arising from our financial instruments are liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk as explained
below. Our treasury department has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of our risk management
framework.

The treasury department’s activities are designed to:

    - protect the Group’s financial results and position from the financial risks discussed below;

    - maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimizing returns; and

    - provide adequate and sufficient funding to the Group.

For further information on the risks discussed below, please see note 19 of the consolidated financial statements
of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.

82


-----

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due
without incurring unacceptable costs. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions. A
material and sustained shortfall in cash flow could undermine the Group’s credit rating, impair investor confidence and
also restrict the Group’s ability to raise funds.

We have various credit facilities including a Revolving Credit Facility with a consortium of banks, containing
several financial covenants. As of March 31, 2024, €133 million, representing 19.0%, is withdrawn of the total €700
million Revolving Credit Facility. Compliance with financial covenants is reviewed regularly and they are reported to the
lenders quarterly in line with the requirements under the facilities. This is based on cash delivery from the business,
coupled with the proceeds from bond issuances and other sources of debt. This cash has been invested conservatively
with low-risk counterparties at maturities of less than three months.

Upon completion of the Transactions, we expect our financial liabilities at that time to comprise principally the
Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Credit
Facilities described above under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual
obligations. We are exposed to credit risk from our operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from our
financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institution and treasury instruments. Credit risk related
to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a Group basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions
involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. We have not entered into credit default
derivatives. To reduce this risk, we have concentrated our main activities with a number of counterparties which have
secure credit ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counterparty based on financial position, credit rating and past
experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by our treasury department.

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the established policy, procedures and controls
relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on a credit rating scorecard
and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly
monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit
insurance obtained from reputable banks and other financial institutions.

As of December 31, 2023, we had over 2,590 customers across 56 subsidiaries with the top 50 customers
accounting for approximately 48% of all the receivables outstanding. Not one of our individual customers had a
concentration of more than 4% of the outstanding trade receivable balance. An impairment analysis is performed at each
reporting date. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and
supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future
economic conditions. Generally, trade receivables are written off if past due for more than one year and are not subject to
enforcement activity. The letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance are considered integral part of trade
receivables and considered in the calculation of impairment. We evaluate the concentration of risk with respect to trade
receivables as low, as our customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent
markets.

**_Market Risk_**

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimizing the return.

The Group’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use
of financial instruments:

    - Commodity price risk: the Group is exposed to the risk of changes in commodity prices in relation to its
purchase of certain raw materials. The key commodities used by us are Plant Oils. We use commodity
derivatives (future, over the counter and tradable forward contract contracts) to hedge against this risk. Our
policy is to hedge the majority of the risk within the relevant pricing window. The extend of hedging is
determined on an ongoing basis on a country and/or region basis, based on hedging volumes (open
exposure) and the pricing horizon. The hedging ratio increases when the exposure is higher and the window

83


-----

is shorter. All commodity derivative contracts hedge future purchases of Plant Oils, packaging materials
and utilities on a three to six months rolling basis and contracts are settled either in cash or by physical
delivery.

    - Currency risk: the Group’s reporting currency is the euro. Our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign
exchange rates relates to operating activities (sales and purchases), borrowings, cash and cash equivalents
and derivatives against the functional currencies of the Group companies. The main currencies that give
rise to currency risk are the U.S. dollar, pound sterling and the Polish zloty and the foreign denominated
loans in these currencies. We are also subject to currency risk in relation to the translation of the net
investments of our foreign operations into euros for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We
manage foreign exchange exposures by transacting as much as possible in the currencies where the
operations are situated. Remaining risks are managed within reasonable limits, mainly using forward
foreign currency exchange contracts. The aim of our approach to management of currency risk is to
minimize foreign currency risk with consideration of the cost to enter into hedge instruments. We do not
hedge the currency risk in relation to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

    - Interest rate risk: the Group is exposed to market interest rate fluctuations on its floating rate debt. Increases
in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest cost of floating-rate debt and increase the cost of
future borrowings. Our ability to manage interest costs also has an impact on reported results. Our interest
rate risk management approach aims for an optimal balance between fixed and floating-rate interest rate
exposures on expected net debt. The objective of this approach is to minimize annual interest costs after tax
and to reduce volatility. This is achieved either by issuing fixed or floating-rate long-term debt, or by
modifying interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate derivatives, such as swaps, caps and collars.

The above risks may affect the Group’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The
Group’s objective in managing market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimizing returns.
Generally, the Group applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.

**Material Accounting Policy Information**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain assumptions,
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of
revision and the future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

Additional information about our material accounting policy information can be found in the notes to our
consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included elsewhere
in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Significant Judgment_**

Utilisation of tax losses and interest carry forwards: Deferred tax assets are recognized for loss carry forwards
and interest carry forwards to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
loss carry forwards and interest carry forwards can be utilized. In determining the recognition of deferred tax assets, the
Group’s assessment of future taxable income, available taxable temporary differences, tax planning, applicable limitations
on the use of tax loss carry forwards and interest carry forwards are factors taken into account. These factors are
determined in consultation with external tax experts. If actual future taxable income is different than originally assessed,
if tax planning fails to materialize, or if limitations on the use of tax loss carry forward apply, the recognition of deferred
tax assets may have to be adjusted which may have an effect on the reported tax expense and net result.

**_Significant Estimates_**

Estimation of future rebates and other sales reductions: Sales are reduced with different type of sales reductions
and rebates to customers. Where agreements span a financial period-end, estimations are required of projected net sales
and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate level earned as agreements may involve multiple tiers.

Assumptions used in discounted cash flow estimates: Estimates of future business performance, cash generation,
long term growth and discount rates are used in the assessment of impairment of assets at the balance sheet date.

84


-----

Uncertain tax positions: The Group operates in many countries and is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
When there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, management is required to consider the effect of the uncertainty in
determining taxable profit (tax loss), tax base, tax losses and tax credits and tax rates. The Group’s accounting policy for
uncertain income tax treatments is consistent with the requirements in IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.
The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax position is to a certain extent judgmental. The main judgmental
area relates to the application of local tax laws which may be subject to different interpretations.

**Upfield’s TAM**

Since 2018, Upfield has expanded its strategic category focus and its core categories now cover Butters and
Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses (since 2020) (for a detailed description of Upfield’s products, see “Business—
_Products”). As a result, in 2022, Upfield’s TAM across its four core categories, including both dairy and non-dairy,_
equalled approximately €151 billion globally, an increase of 15 times compared to approximately €11 billion in 2017
where the category focus was predominantly on margarine. Upfield believes its existing geographic footprint and product
portfolio provide significant opportunities to continue to grow its current TAM.

The following chart provides an overview of Upfield’s total addressable global market in 2022, including both
dairy and non-dairy, across its four core categories as well as retail and foodservice:

**Size (2022A)**

Upfield believes that its current global footprint and renovated and innovative product portfolio provide a
significant growth opportunity within its TAM. Within its TAM (which covers both dairy and non-dairy products), given
the growing consumer preference and other trends expected to support the growth of plant-based diets in the backdrop of
environmental, sustainability and health concerns, Upfield is well positioned to capitalize on future conversion to plantbased within its core categories, especially given its strong position globally and in the key markets in which it operates
(see also “—Key Trends” and “Summary—Strengths and Strategies”). Currently, the penetration of plant-based products
in the Butters, Creams and Cheeses categories is low, and estimated at less than 1%. For illustrative purposes, the table
below sets out the potential values for the respective plant-based segments of these categories and liquids, assuming 5%

86


-----

and 16% plant-based penetration, with the 16% plant-based penetration being in line with the long-term development of
plant-based milk.

In addition to the plant-based spreads market which in 2022 equalled approximately €16 billion, there is a
potential opportunity for Upfield within the Butters, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses categories of approximately €23 billion
(based on an incremental €7 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 5% plant-based penetration) or
€38 billion (based on an incremental €22 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 16% plant-based
penetration).

Upfield may also access a broader TAM by expanding into countries in which it currently has no presence (for
a detailed description of its current markets, see “Business—Channels and Regions”) and by continuing to innovate and
expand its portfolio, in particular Plant Cheeses to address more and more mainstream cheese consumers and formats (see
also —“Accelerated Conversion to Plant-based Diets”).

**Key Trends**

Upfield’s more sustainable plant-based product portfolio addresses concerns over the instability of the current
global food system while being aligned with key consumer preferences for products which deliver on sustainability, are
healthier and adapt to changing consumption habits (see also “Business—Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”)”).

**_Sustainability in Focus: Benefits of Plant-Based Diets_**

The way we produce and consume food has significant impacts on carbon emissions, land use and water use.
The current global food system is unsustainable: If the diets of G20 nations were adopted worldwide by 2050, it is
expected that we would require up to seven planets to support us. Furthermore, the global population is expected to grow
by over two billion over the next 30 years while 9.2% of the global population faced hunger in 2022. There is acute focus
by governments worldwide on prioritising food security and ensuring that significant increases in demand for food
resources can be met. In addition, 38 million square kilometres, approximately 36% of habitable land globally, are
currently used for livestock, despite meat and dairy overall representing a low proportion of our daily calorific intake,
which thus represents a relatively inefficient use of space for a growing population. Plant-based crops feed more people
while occupying less land. Plant-based food uses only 16% of global agricultural land, yet provides 83% of our calories;
harnessing this efficiency would feed a 2050 world more sustainably.

Plant-based dairy alternatives are the more sustainable option to meet increased food requirements as plant crops
require less land, water and other resources than dairy cows. In particular, plant-based dairy alternatives result in
significantly reduced GHG emissions and eliminate the methane emissions from animals (approximately 9% of global
GHG emissions can be attributed to cattle). Compared to their dairy equivalents, Upfield’s (i) Plant Butters and Spreads
contribute 70% less CO₂ emissions and need 66% less land and 50% less water, (ii) Plant Creams contribute 50% less
CO₂ emissions and (iii) Plant Cheeses contribute 74% less CO₂ emissions and overall have less than half the climate
footprint.

Increasingly, consumers are seeking more environmentally friendly product choices because of heightened
concern over the environment and climate change. Plant-based products contribute less CO₂ emissions, require fewer
resources to produce and have a longer shelf life thereby reducing waste. This is a priority across generations, with 50%
of consumers saying they restrict their dairy consumption. Furthermore, retailers named GHG emissions as the number

87


-----

one key ESG topic on which they evaluate their suppliers. More environmentally friendly packaging is also an
increasingly key purchasing criteria, with consumers seeking to reduce their plastic usage through all-paper packaging
solutions. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand,
with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in early 2024. Furthermore, Upfield has taken proactive
steps in order to address consumer concerns regarding both health risks of palm oil and its historical association with
deforestation. In response, it has created a patented palm oil-free technology and shifted its focus on offering alternatives
to palm oil in select markets where consumer sentiment leans towards avoiding palm oil due to health concerns. Since
2019, Upfield has transitioned to sourcing certified (segregated and mass balance) palm oil, underscoring its commitment
to sustainability and actively mitigating the impact of deforestation. In 2023, Upfield achieved an outstanding score of
8.5 (out of 10) on the RSPO’s Shared Responsibility Scorecard, placing Upfield in the top 4% of companies demonstrating
sustainable leadership in palm oil sourcing. Upfield continuously explores novel recipes utilizing sustainable palm oil and
alternative ingredients through its patented palm oil-free technology. See “Business—Procurement.”

**_Health & Wellness in Focus: Benefits of Plant-based Diets_**

Consumers have ever greater access to information on nutrition and are more actively considering the health
profile of the products they eat and drink. There is increased focus on clean-label products with formulations and traceable
natural ingredients, which 33% of EU consumers look for. The food industry, particularly in developed markets and with
respect to unhealthier foods and high-fat, sweet and salty options, could also face a softer demand in the coming years
because of obesity medicines decreasing appetite and reducing daily calorie intake, thereby driving consumers who are
taking obesity medication to healthier options. Upfield’s products are focused on a limited number of natural ingredients:
for example, Upfield’s Plant Butter only contains six to seven natural ingredients without the artificial ingredients
historically used in the spreads industry.

Within the dairy category in particular, consumers are increasingly focused on heart health and are, therefore,
conscious of limiting their intake of trans fats and looking for low cholesterol products, including those which use natural
plant sterols. Upfield’s products have natural ingredients (i.e., clean label and simple formulations with traceable
ingredients) and are demonstrably healthier than their dairy equivalents, being cholesterol-free and trans-fat-free (for
example, 100 grams of dairy butter has 3 grams of trans fat). Further, 95% of Upfield’s products beat the benchmark for
saturated fats of dairy alternatives and Flora ProActiv is clinically proven to lower cholesterol by using plant sterols.

Consumers are also more actively seeking out products which have incremental health benefits and fortified
nutrition, such as added vitamins, calcium and healthy Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. Upfield’s BlueBand contains vitamins
and Omega 3 and 6, in addition to having the lowest saturated fat content (36%) in line with WHO recommendations.
One portion of BlueBand contains 0.3g of Omega 3, which is equivalent to one portion of salmon, one glass of cow’s
milk or three eggs.

The above is not at the expense of taste, texture and affordability, which are still key purchasing criteria, as
consumers look to buy healthier products with on-par performance at affordable price points. Due to the investment and
innovation which Upfield has driven in its categories, Upfield’s Plant Butters and Spreads are, on average, approximately
40% cheaper and Upfield believes that they now have functional performance parity and almost taste parity with dairy
equivalents. Specifically, eight out of ten consumers stated that Upfield’s Flora Salted Plant Butter tasted like dairy butter,
while 92% said it baked the same, 83% said it cooked the same and 82% said it spread the same. In Poland, in 2023,
Upfield was also honored that its new Rama Crema 15% product was recognized as the best new product in dairy creams
and cream alternatives by leading trade magazine Handel. What is particularly inspiring is that Rama Crema 15% not
only outperformed another plant-based cream but also two dairy options that made it to the final nominees.

Upfield believes its Plant Creams have several health and environmental advantages over dairy creams, including
a longer shelf life (reducing waste for customers and consumers), greater volume and stability in whipping, acid stable,
heat stable and allergen free (where 100% plant-based). See also “Business—Products—Plant Creams.”

**_Changing Consumer Consumption Habits_**

Convenience and availability are increasingly important as brands are expected to innovate to meet consumer
need states and occasions, such as on-the-go and impulse, as well as the growing baking and cooking categories. This has
also caused a shift in the distribution channels through which consumers purchase products, evidenced by the increasing
prevalence of e-commerce. To this end, Upfield has developed relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce
platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco, Amazon and Carrefour online, which represent a significant growth opportunity in the
regions in which it operates, especially in Europe and the Americas. Upfield’s strong retail presence in major supermarkets
and at retailers globally means its brands benefit from over 90% awareness across major markets. Furthermore, Upfield’s

products are available in multiple formats to meet different consumption occasions and affordability criteria, including
sachets, standard sizes and family sizes.

**_Accelerated Conversion to Plant-based Diets_**

The above trends have historically driven and are expected to drive further conversion to plant-based diets in the
future. Plant-based milk was the first category to benefit from an uplift in conversion, with the penetration of plant-based
milk in retail markets for Western Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States growing from 5% in 2010 to 16%
in 2022 (3.2 times compared to 2010) and being expected to grow to 22% in 2025 (4.4 times compared to 2010).

**Butters and Spreads**

_Market Positioning_

In 2022, Upfield’s TAM for butters and spreads, across both dairy and non-dairy, equalled approximately €44
billion globally, of which €30 billion was from retail channels and €14 billion was from foodservice channels.

**_Creams_**

_Market Positioning_

According to NielsenIQ measurement data, Upfield is a leading branded company in its focus markets, the United
Kingdom (number one position) and Germany (number one position). The market trends in the creams category indicate:

    - In the United Kingdom, the creams category delivered approximately 2.0% per annum value growth from
2017 to 2022, largely driven by growth in baking and cooking, and is expected to grow at approximately
1.0% per annum in value from 2022 to 2027, with baking and cooking volumes relatively stable despite a

**_Cheeses_**

_Market Positioning_

According to NielsenIQ measurement data, Upfield held the number one global market share in the plant cheeses
category. Additionally, according to NielsenIQ measurement data, Upfield has leading positions across the largest plant
cheeses markets globally, including the United States (number one position) and the United Kingdom (number one
position). The market trends in the plant-based cheeses category indicate:

    - In the United States, the plant-based cheeses category delivered approximately 14.0% per annum value
growth from 2017 to 2022, mainly driven by increasing adoption by dairy avoiders, and is expected to grow
at approximately 14.0% per annum in value from 2022 to 2027, driven by increased conversion as a result
of increasingly high product quality and category visibility.

    - In the United Kingdom, the plant-based cheeses category delivered approximately 15.0% per annum value
growth from 2017 to 2022, driven by the adoption of vegan diets, and is expected to grow at approximately
15.0% per annum in value from 2022 to 2027, driven by increased conversion as a result of product quality
and a widened breadth of applications.

_TAM_

In 2022, Upfield’s TAM for cheeses, across both dairy and non-dairy, equalled approximately €61 billion
globally, of which €32 billion was from retail channels and €29 billion was from foodservice channels.

**Distribution Channels: Retail & Foodservice**

Upfield addresses the market for its core categories through retail and foodservice channels (see also “Business—
_Channels and Regions”). In 2022, Upfield’s TAM equalled €101 billion in retail and €50 billion in foodservice._

The current penetration of plant-based products within the foodservice market is slightly higher than in retail,
benefitting from the same trends driving plant-based dairy alternatives overall in addition to certain distinct category
growth drivers. Foodservice is a strong outlet to drive awareness about and the adoption of plant-based diets and products,
driven by customer advocacy and the requirement for suppliers to have quality products meeting increasingly customized
expectations, including frying, cooking and melting specifications, as well as taste and texture parity with dairy
equivalents.

In the retail market, Upfield anticipates significant growth in plant-based categories, particularly in creams and
cheeses, outpacing traditional dairy products. Upfield observes accelerated growth across volumes of butters and spreads,
compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. From 2022 to 2027, plant-based retail values are expected to grow 3.0% to 5.0% per
annum overall, including plant-based cheeses and plant-based creams which are expected to grow 15% to 17% per annum
and 19% to 21% per annum, respectively, while plant-based butter and spreads are expected to grow 2.0% to 3.0% per
annum.

In the foodservice market, plant-based categories are expected to out-grow the broader foodservice market:
15.0% to 20.0% overall per annum volume growth is expected for plant-based creams and plant-based cheeses in the midterm, tapering to 7.0% to 12.0% per annum in the long term, and plant-based butters and spreads are expected to grow
approximately 3.0% to 5.0% per annum, driven by a strong customer pull for the functional benefits and price advantages.
From 2022 to 2027, plant-based foodservice volumes are expected to grow 4.0% per annum overall, including plant-based
creams which are expected to grow 12.0% per annum, while plant-based butters and spreads are expected to be flat.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a global leader in plant-based food, established in 2018, as a purpose-driven company with a clear vision:
“To make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and
good for our planet.”

We develop, produce, distribute and market plant-based dairy alternative products in over 100 countries across
four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses. Backed by a rich heritage and a global scale, we
are highly differentiated in the plant-based sector. Our reinvigorated iconic power brands reflect over 150 years of product
expertise and brand heritage and are trusted by consumers globally. Our scale, culture and capabilities, including extensive
food technology and innovation expertise, our community of dedicated “Upfielders,” consisting of our management team
and employees, and our 14 manufacturing facilities across five continents, provide a strong value proposition for our
customers and consumers, and ensure we are well positioned to advance the future of food.

Our products are marketed under a family of historic and iconic brands with strong recognition in their target
markets. Our products are made with natural and sustainably sourced ingredients. Our carefully selected ingredients come
from a diversified supply chain to minimize risk and environmental impact and maximize taste, functionality, health,
affordability and sustainability for our consumers.

Our operations are diversified across three regions, namely Europe, the Americas and AMEA. We hold
leadership positions in the global butter and spreads, and plant cheese segments, with leadership positions in creams in
Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets. We sell our products across these regions primarily through
retail channels, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and other outlets. In addition, through our
professional foodservice channel, we sell our products to commercial outlets, such as quick service restaurants, bakeries,
pizza and pasta outlets, hotels, catering and industrial kitchens, and to the social sector, such as educational institutions,
workplaces and hospitals.

During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, our net sales were €2,793 million, €3,375 million
and €3,275 million, respectively. During the same periods, our operating profit was €288 million, €453 million and €570
million, and our Normalized EBITDA was €666 million, €749 million and €831 million, respectively. During the twelve
months ended March 31, 2024, our net sales were €3,209 million, our operating profit was €604 million and Normalized
EBITDA was €862 million.

**_Our Successful Transformation_**

Following the acquisition of our business by KKR in 2018, we began a journey to separate, transform and
reinvent our business, building on our existing strong foundations: a global platform with iconic power brands and worldclass knowledge.

Our journey took more than four years, with the wholescale transformational part of our journey completed in
2022. To become an independent business, we focused on separating and stabilizing our business, simplifying, renovating
and innovating our product portfolio, expanding into new product categories, investing in R&D through the opening of a
new Food Science Centre, optimizing our supply chain, building an end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled
platform and building a new IT infrastructure. See “Business—History” for a detailed description of our transformation
journey.

Building on our existing strong foundations and as a result of the significant industrial, digital and cultural
transformation undertaken since 2018, we believe we are well positioned to advance the future of food.

**Strengths**

**_We are well positioned to advance the Future of Food in a large and growing TAM_**

We believe that the future of food lies in tasty, high-quality, responsibly made, plant-based food. Transforming
the food system by increasing the consumption of plant-based foods in our diets is the key to address the impact of what
we eat on climate, nature and health. As a global leader in plant-based food, offering our products in four large and
growing categories and selling into over 100 countries worldwide, we are well positioned to advance the future of food
and to meet the growing shift in consumer preferences to plant-based eating. To inspire more people to eat plant-based
alternatives, we focus on delivering tasty, high performing, healthy, sustainable and affordable products. We believe that
there should be no compromise for consumers when they change to plant-based products as compared to dairy alternatives.

91


-----

We benefit from a senior management team with significant experience in the consumer-packaged goods
industry. A majority of our current senior management team has been with us since our acquisition by KKR in 2018, and
has been critical in our successful transformation. Under their leadership, we have separated, transformed and reinvented
our business as a global leader in plant-based food and strongly positioned our business to drive conversion to plant-based
alternatives. We believe that our senior management team has also been instrumental in developing a strong and motivated
organization with a purpose- and performance-driven culture, which is carried by a passionate and engaged community
of “Upfielders.” We believe that our community of “Upfielders” are aligned with our purpose, and are highly motivated
to make an impact, deliver sustainable, purposeful long-term growth and advance the transition to a plant-based food
future.

Our ability to advance the future of food is further strengthened by our portfolio of Plant Butter and Spreads,
Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses products, sold through our reinvigorated and iconic brands, our global scale and
manufacturing footprint, our food technology and innovation expertise which together provide a strong value proposition
for our customers and consumers.

We offer these plant-based products in our four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and
Cheeses, which provide us access to a large and growing TAM (across both dairy and non-dairy) of approximately €151
billion as of 2022, which is 15 times larger than our TAM of approximately €11 billion in 2017 under our previous
ownership (which was focused on plant-based spreads (margarines)). Our expansion into the Butter, Creams, Liquids and
Cheeses categories, in addition to Spreads, resulted in an expansion of our TAM. While currently the penetration of plantbased products in the Butters, Creams and Cheeses categories is low, and estimated at less than 1%, there is a potential
opportunity of approximately €23 billion (based on an incremental €7 billion opportunity in the above categories when
assuming a 5% plant-based penetration) or €38 billion (based on an incremental €22 billion opportunity in the above
categories when assuming a 16% plant-based penetration) (see also “Industry—Upfield’s TAM”). We believe that our
global footprint and renovated and innovative product portfolio provide a significant growth opportunity in our TAM.
Within our TAM (which covers both dairy and non-dairy products), given the growing consumer preference for plantbased diets in the backdrop of environmental, sustainability and health concerns, there is potential for increased rate of
conversion to plant-based products, which we are well positioned to leverage, especially given our strong position globally
and in the key markets in which we operate. For instance, according to NielsenIQ measurement data, within our Plant
Butter and Spreads core category, which contributed 81% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are
the largest producer globally in terms of market share and hold leading positions across some of the largest butter and
spreads markets globally, including North America, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, according to
NielsenIQ measurement data, we are the global leader in the plant cheese segment, and have leadership positions in
creams in Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets.

**_A reinvigorated portfolio of brands reshaping the future of food_**

With our portfolio of trusted brands we believe we can drive conversion to plant-based food and leverage our
strong market positions going forward. Our brand platforms are led by our power brands, our most iconic brands, which
have a long history and heritage. We believe that our power brands are deeply rooted and trusted by our consumers and
customers across a number of our markets and have high brand awareness in their respective markets. These brands
include, for example, Flora (launched in 1964), Country Crock (launched in 1954), Becel +ProActiv (Becel launched in
1962 and ProActiv launched in 2000), Rama (launched in 1924), BlueBand (launched in 1916) and Violife (acquired in
2020). In addition to our power brands, we also have a number of country or region specific brands with a strong local
heritage and brand awareness, such as Lätta in Sweden, Stork in the United Kingdom and Tulipan in Spain.

Following our acquisition by KKR, we have also reorganized and reinvigorated our brand portfolio since 2018.
We refreshed our brands around our end-to-end brand platforms, so as to provide for better harmonization and efficiencies
across our R&D and innovation pipeline, sales and marketing and supply chain activities. Our brand platforms are founded
upon key prerequisites of taste and affordability, but each platform serves a distinct consumer need and is mapped against
the key usage occasions and growth opportunities across our categories and markets.

We also organize our brands across three different price tiers: “good,” (targeting price sensitive customers)
“better” (targeting customers looking for additional product benefits at a more affordable price than a dairy alternative)
and “best” (targeting customers seeking premium products with multiple features, such as lowering cholesterol). We
assign our brands and products across these tiers which are each designed to meet distinct consumer needs and cater for
certain price sensitivities, thereby catering to various social demographic needs. We believe that such categorization
simplifies consumer decision-making and helps us strategically position each tier to appeal to a different array of
consumers.

**_Well-invested end-to-end platform_**

We operate an end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform, in which we have made significant
investment in recent years, and through which we produce and sell our products to retail and foodservice partners in over
100 countries globally. We operate a global network of manufacturing facilities and regional cold chain distribution
centers with capabilities to support growth. Our historic strong cash generation has enabled us to invest significantly in
our global operations, ensuring we have the latest manufacturing innovations at our disposal. We own a total of 14
manufacturing facilities, comprising seven in Europe, four in the Americas and three in AMEA. These facilities produced
approximately 91% of our total production volume for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our comprehensive
manufacturing network with a globally scaled and digitally-enabled supply chain, is well positioned for future growth.
Our end-to-end platform is supported by our general ERP system and our SAP4Hana ERP system, which enable us to
make data-driven operational decisions.

Our robust in-house manufacturing capabilities allow for complete control and flexibility in the manufacturing
process, through which we can (i) maintain a closer level of control over our robust quality and safety standards, (ii) better
establish and control cost savings, (iii) limit and control manufacturing disruptions, (iv) reduce our carbon footprint and
(v) manage the manufacturing process more efficiently.

Our products and customers further benefit from our internal centralized procurement function designed to
leverage our purchasing expertise and maximize scale efficiencies across the regions where we operate. Our procurement
function has a deep understanding of commodity cycles and risk management, and many years of experience in the oils
market. See “Business—Procurement” for a detailed description of our procurement function.

**_An industry leading R&D expertise delivering innovation and driving conversion to plant-based food_**

Our strong innovation pipeline underpins our mission to revolutionize the plant-based ecosystem by delivering
tastier, high-quality products with natural ingredients. That pipeline is driven by our investment in R&D, oils & fats and
plant-based proteins amongst other enabling technologies, with food science at its core. We believe that we have an
industry leading R&D expertise that enables us to produce new and innovative products using key ingredient know-how,
technically sophisticated equipment and processes across our core categories and products. As an insights-driven
organization we seek to continually enhance consumer experience with respect to taste, functionality, health and nutrition,
sustainability and affordability by developing relevant product and packaging innovation.

We continuously invest in food innovation and food technology expertise from our new state-of-the-art food
science centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands (“Food Science Centre”), which we have developed with an investment
capital of approximately €38 million. Our Food Science Centre focuses on plant-based food innovation and it aims to
pioneer the development of plant-based foods, enabling technologies including oils and fats as well as proteins, and
sustainable packaging solutions. Our team of more than 150 food scientists, food and packaging technologists and
specialists focus on the development of plant-based foods and sustainable packaging solutions. We are also a leading filer
of plant-based patents, and hold 656 patents and patent applications. In 2023, we applied for a further ten patents across
our categories and core technologies.

With our deep expertise in plant-based and natural ingredients and proprietary knowledge of plant-based food
manufacturing, we have implemented a significant product portfolio overhaul since 2018, focused on taste, clean label
and naturalness, where possible. For instance, we developed our first-generation Plant Butter product between 2018 and
2020, which we have since then further evolved, offering products we aim to achieve taste parity as compared to dairy
butter. We have also developed new recipes and ingredients for our products, for example to provide consumers with
palm oil-free options through our patented technology. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging
technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand, with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in
early 2024. Our R&D and innovation roadmap is centered on continuous improvement and innovation within our core
categories, to attract more and more consumers and broaden the appeal of our products. Key areas of focus include further
improving our Plant Cheese product range, in particular in cold applications to further improve our Plant Cheese offering
and applying some of our developing technology to further improve our Plant Butters and Plant Creams products. In
addition, we continue to develop our packaging technology to create sustainable packaging and achieve our goal to reduce
the environmental impact of our packaging through reduced plastic usage and increased recyclability of our packaging.
As well as innovating internally to achieve these goals, we partner with academia, established ingredients and packaging
players, start-ups and scale-ups whose differentiated propositions we believe can complement our R&D capabilities and
our ability to scale through our distribution channels, platform and growth levers.

**_Growth levers underpinned by a resilient, attractive financial profile with high cash generation_**

Our growth levers are centered around driving conversion from dairy products to our plant-based products and
involve:

    - Creating the best-ever products made by us: delivering tastier, high-quality products with natural ingredients
in our four core categories, underpinned by a strong innovation pipeline;

    - Deploying our power brands: leveraging our iconic power brands, recognized and trusted across markets,
with clear propositions;

    - Executing in multiple channels: reaching as many people as possible by executing well within our channels:
retail and foodservice; and

    - Driving and leveraging our scale: leveraging our digitally enabled end-to-end platform and scale.

Our transformation journey since 2018 has taken place against a turbulent and volatile backdrop of events
including a global pandemic, associated supply chain challenges, commodity inflation and the ongoing cost-of-living
crisis. However, during this period, by leveraging our growth levers, we have demonstrated a track record of stable
financial performance, in particular delivered strong growth in organic net sales, gross profit and Normalized EBITDA.
Between the year ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our reported net sales increased
at a CAGR of 6.4%, our gross profit increased at a CAGR of 11.4% and our Normalized EBITDA increased at a CAGR
of 12.1%.

We have also demonstrated strong cash generation, and generated a normalized free cash flow and normalized
free cash conversion ratio of €702 million and 81.4%, respectively, in each case, for the twelve months ended March 31,
2024. We believe this compares favorably with our peers and is supported by, among other things:

    - our flexible cost base, which allows for a sustainable gross margin. We have clear, consistent and wellestablished supply chain, and hedging policies with respect to our major inputs and foreign exchange
exposures, which has allowed us to maintain strong levels of profitability in periods of fluctuations and
under high inflationary conditions;

    - our sustained profitability, with a Normalized EBITDA margin of 23.8%, 22.2%, 25.4% and 26.9%, in the
years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024,
respectively, largely attributable to our flexible cost structure, our powerful brands, our revenue growth
management capabilities and our track record of operational cost savings;

    - a favorable working capital position, as we benefit from a negative cash conversion cycle. This largely is a
structural feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and finished product
markets in which we operate and our operational efficiency with respect to our inventory management; and

    - our comprehensive manufacturing network with a globally scaled and digitally-enabled supply chain and
significant spare capacity. This allows for increased net sales volumes without incremental capital
expenditure resulting in strong cash generation.

Our strong cash generation and resulting Normalized EBITDA growth has helped us to progressively deleverage.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our historical
leverage ratio was 8.4x, 7.2x, 6.5x and 6.5x, respectively. Our historical leverage ratio represents the ratio of our (i) net
debt, which is defined as our financial liabilities gross of unamortized financing fees less cash and cash equivalents,
excluding lease liabilities and derivative financial instruments to (ii) Normalized EBITDA.

**Strategies**

Our strategies are focused on the continued implementation of our growth levers to capture the key opportunities
across our core categories and markets. Our clear mission and purpose forms the cornerstone of our strategy to deliver
long term sustainable, profitable and purposeful growth by bringing tasty plant-based foods to people all over the world,
and achieve our purpose “to make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food
that is good for you and for our planet.”

**_Our growth levers_**

_Creating the best-ever products made by us: delivering tastier, high-quality products with natural ingredients in our four_
_core categories, underpinned by a strong innovation pipeline_

Since 2018, we have reinvented our product portfolio, investing significant resources to create the best-ever
products made by us, including by harmonizing and simplifying our ingredients list and moving towards fewer, natural
and fully plant-based ingredients. We are focused on delivering our best-ever products that are designed to have the same
or superior taste, versatility and performance (cooking, baking, and spreading) as dairy products. We believe that there
should be no compromise for consumers when they change to a plant-based butter or spread, liquid, plant-based cream or
plant-based cheese, as compared to dairy alternatives. For example, our Plant Butter is specifically formulated with the
aim to match the performance and taste of dairy butter. Based on more than 50 taste profiles, we created a series of plant
butters which we strive to taste and perform just like dairy butter and that match the specific taste preferences of different
consumer profiles in key markets. Also, our know-how and expertise of natural ingredients has enabled us to simplify our
Plant Butter to contain just six or seven natural ingredients (including certain Plant Oils, water, plant protein and, in some
cases, salt) and enable consumers to swap it directly for dairy butter in any recipe.

Consumers are also increasingly focused on clean label and naturalness, and 99% of all our ingredients by
volume are natural in origin. We continue to invest in R&D to deliver products using recipes made from natural
ingredients or products that are free from artificial colors, flavors and preservatives, and without compromising on food
safety, quality and performance. In addition, as part of our commitment to be 100% plant-based by the end of 2030, we
are continuously reviewing our use of dairy ingredients where there is no compromise in taste or performance.

Aside from taste and performance, we focus on the nutritional benefits of our products, as well as their positive
contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and a key reason why people choose our products. In 2022,
our team of nutritionists and product developers created the Upfield nutritional benchmarking program, based on what
science tells us is required for each different product proposition and which introduced saturated fat and trans-fat targets
for plant creams and plant cheeses. This helps us ensure that we meet nutritional targets in our products and are aligned
with international dietary guidelines and regulations. Our plant-based products contain zero trans-fats and lower saturated
fats compared to dairy alternatives.

So, whether consumers are looking for a product to bake a cake, help lower their cholesterol or containing the
nutrients to support a growing family, our products strive to provide a “no compromise” choice, that is better for
consumers and better for the planet.

_Deploying our power brands: leveraging our iconic power brands, recognized, trusted and loved over the world with_
_clear propositions_

Our business traces its origin and heritage back over 150 years and, as a result, many of our reinvigorated iconic
power brands, including BlueBand and Rama, have a brand heritage spanning over 100 years. Our power brands,
including as an example, Flora, Country Crock, Becel +ProActiv, Rama, BlueBand and Violife, are trusted in their key
markets globally and are at the heart of our future growth strategy and success.

Our power brands are well-known and have a high brand awareness amongst consumers in our markets. They
represent the platform from which we have successfully launched our product innovations and portfolio renovation.
Through our power brands we engage with both loyal and new consumers, offering people a positive choice, both as a
plant-based alternative to dairy and also for less competitive brands and private label. Based on independent brand
research, many of our power brands are among the best-performing FMCG/packaged grocery brands across our key
markets in terms of brand awareness. We believe that the high score of our power brands indicate that consumers are
more likely to choose our brands over others, which is a strong indicator of increasing brand influence and share. To
further support our power brands, we complemented the ongoing innovation across our portfolio with an increase in
strategic advertising and promotion investment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our advertising and promotion
expenses amounted to €173 million (equalling 5.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 and an increase
of 22.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022). For example, in 2023, we launched our “Skip the Cow”
campaign aimed at informing and driving consumers towards more plant-based products. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign
pushed the uptake of Flora Plant and has proved to be a valuable resource in boosting consumer awareness of our Plant
Butter offering and also contributed to a strong positive consumer net sentiment of 86% towards our overall Flora brand.
Furthermore, following the “Skip the Cow” campaign, Flora Plant Butter experienced growth in household penetration
and share of segment in the United Kingdom. Following the success of the “Skip the Cow” campaign in the United
Kingdom, we launched similar campaigns across European markets, such as Germany and Austria, and intend to also roll
it out to other key markets such as the Netherlands, Poland or Spain, and also across other brands. To further leverage the

strength of our brands, we have from time to time considered, and continue to consider and evaluate, modifications to our
corporate branding and identity to more closely align with our key brands.

_Executing in multiple channels: reaching as many people as possible through our channels: retail and foodservice_

We also differentiate ourselves through our retail and professional foodservice channels, which enable us to
reach consumers directly through both industry channels. We sell our products to retail outlets, including to many of the
world’s largest retailers, as well as to wholesalers. We also enhanced our e-commerce capabilities by developing
relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco, Amazon and Carrefour
online, which have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe represent a significant
growth opportunity in the regions in which we operate, especially in Europe and the Americas. In addition, in emerging
markets in which we operate across our regions, we have established a strong market channel based on deep relationships
with well-known and reputable distributors. Through our foodservice channel, we also supply the professional channel,
including restaurants, hotels and industrial kitchens. This multi-channel approach gives us access to a broad and diverse
customer base, which enhances our position as a leader in many of our core categories. Because of our strong relationships
with leading global and regional retailers, we operate as the supplier of choice and/or “category captain” for certain
strategic retailers, providing in-depth knowledge and consumer insight for particular product categories to our retailer
customers.

Moreover, we believe there is considerable potential to introduce and expand our core product categories in the
foodservice channel given our current portfolio’s appeal across high-end clients who lead and influence the menu adoption
cycle to large quick-service restaurants, bakery chains and other national accounts where mass adoption occurs. Our
growth strategy in foodservice is focused on selling value-added branded products with high-demand applications to
commercial customers and driving customer acquisition through our chef-led sales approach (see also “—Sales and
_Marketing”)._

_Driving and leveraging our scale: leveraging our digitally enabled end-to-end platform and scale_

Through our end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform we produce and sell our products to retail
and foodservice partners in over 100 countries globally. Our global footprint, scale and expertise along the value chain
allow us to leverage efficiencies through which we can derive significant advantages compared to other plant-based
competitors and dairy players. Since 2018, we have demonstrated a track record in driving efficiencies for example by
establishing product portfolio efficiencies (through the retirement of SKUs that are less profitable or of low productivity
and the simplification of our recipes), procurement efficiencies (by sourcing most of our ingredients and packaging
materials from global suppliers who can deliver locally), supply chain efficiencies (through our established local retail
and distribution network) and by maintaining a continued focus on operational efficiencies in line with our value creation
program. Establishing such efficiencies allows us to offer affordable products.

**_Continuously delivering our Purpose_**

Our purpose is “to make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food
that is good for you and for our planet” and it shapes how we approach the sourcing of our ingredients, the development
of our recipes, our relationships with retailers and how we communicate with consumers. We intend to continue fulfilling
our purpose with our commitment and initiatives across our four pillars: (i) plant-based, (ii) healthier lives, (iii) happier
people and (iv) better planet, which are at the heart of our business with tangible programs and milestones.

_Plant-Based_

Actively helping the food transition and building a better, plant-based future is at the heart of what we do. Our
plant-based commitment pillar seeks to help inspire and encourage consumers to switch from dairy to plant-based options.
As we continue to improve our product portfolio, we aim to reach one billion consumers with our products by 2030. We
believe we can achieve that goal by offering consumers a range of products that meet their needs, which also includes
making sure our products taste great, perform well, and are made with simple, natural ingredients.

We believe we are in a strong position to support the transition to a plant-based diet by offering tasty, affordable,
nutritious and more sustainable products. From our Food Science Centre, we continuously invest in high performance
product formulations and reformulations to keep up with consumer needs and trends. For example, in 2023, we launched
the Violife cream cheese block in the United States which has been developed specifically to compete with leading dairy
cream cheeses on the market, following a completely new formulation and format.

To spread awareness around our plant-based products, we frequently launch retail consumer advertising
campaigns with slogans aimed at informing and driving consumers and professionals towards more plant-based products.

96


-----

Other efforts to boost our brands’ and products’ visibility include, for example, sponsorship of sporting events and
partnerships with celebrities and influencers.

In addition, we are also working to support the industry moving forward in terms of plant-based innovation,
which includes establishing standard parameters for plant-based products. For example, we are currently leading the
development of a new ISO standard that we expect will specify technical definitions of, and criteria for, plant-based foods.
We believe that this new ISO standard will help align the global food industry around a single terminology approach.

_Healthier Lives_

The second pillar focuses on the nutritional benefits of our products as well as their positive contribution to
health. Health is a high priority for consumers and we believe is a key reason why people choose our products. We aim
for our products to outperform their dairy counterparts with respect to levels of saturated and trans-fats. We take a sciencebased approach to establishing criteria and targets for each product type we sell, considering who uses them, how
frequently and in which applications. These targets are based on recognized external international standards and official
dietary recommendations, including those from the World Health Organization. Moreover, we have set additional targets
that ensure we can deliver the desired nutritional composition. These include considerations on how we can limit nutrients
of concern and provide essential nutrients that target some of the greatest public health areas of concern, such as heart
health and children’s growth and development. Our brands BlueBand and Becel +ProActiv are our global brands focused
on positively impacting lives across the world by offering healthy, affordable and nutritious options. In 2023,
approximately 30% of our net sales came from products providing health and nutrition benefits and that can be labelled
as such, in compliance with regulation.

Additionally, we believe the future of food lies in quality, responsibly made, plant-based foods. To realize this
future and provide consumers with healthier options, we intend to continue implementing rigorous quality and safety
standards at both our and third-party facilities, including for product design, formulation, raw material sourcing, packing,
manufacturing, storage, transport, display, marketing, communication, sales and product disposal. Moreover, we intend
to continue ensuring that our products are accessible to as many people as possible, which includes ensuring our products
come in at affordable price points. In this regard we intend to maintain a portfolio of products designed for budgetary
brackets across the market spectrum and which are more affordable than dairy alternatives, without compromising on
quality.

_Happier People_

We believe that people are happier when they are engaged and we actively promote a culture of active support. We are
committed to our community of dedicated “Upfielders.” Our approach to employee engagement is driven by three core
values: performance, care and passion. To nurture an engaged workforce, we complete an annual survey to gauge
employee sentiment and opportunities for progress. In addition, diverse businesses are likely to be more successful and
we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive working environment. Across our supply chains, we are connected
to thousands of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs who grow our ingredients and chefs who create and prepare
millions of meals every day. In support of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs, we maintain several partnerships,
enabling and encouraging them to improve agricultural practices and access to markets.

In addition, we seek to reach as many chefs and food service professionals as possible to encourage the adoption
of our products into their cooking, thereby engaging chefs in the plant-based revolution. We do this by, for example,
hosting cooking workshops for chefs or participating in trade fairs where we can reach out and educate professionals on
the advantages of plant-based cooking.

_Better Planet_

With an environmental footprint significantly smaller than that of dairy products, our products can help
consumers reduce their impact, and we ensure our operations do so as well. We are committed to responsibly sourcing
ingredients, developing sustainable packaging and addressing our carbon emissions to enhance sustainability.

Our better planet commitments include our environmental targets to address our material environmental impacts
on the climate, on packaging and on responsible sourcing. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we committed to
Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”) and have worked on redefining our targets in line with the newly published
Forest, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) guidance to align with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. In this respect, we are making multiple efforts towards reducing our emissions and reducing
environmental impact through waste and water management at our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we are committed
to providing packaging that protects products and the planet. We delivered a milestone packaging achievement with the

97


-----

launch of the world’s first paper-based tub for plant-based butters and spreads, our Flora Plant paper tub at the end of
2023, starting our journey towards our target of reducing plastic across our portfolio by 80% by 2030 (compared to a
2020 baseline). In addition, we are committed to responsible and sustainable sourcing of our ingredients (including our
Plant Oils) and packaging materials (including paper and pulp) and our “Responsible Sourcing Policy” and “Business
Partner Code of Conduct” applies to all our suppliers. Where key ingredients are identified as potentially high risk, we
maintain strong individual policies designed to address the potential risks inherent in these supply chains, particularly
focussing on deforestation and exploitation. See also “Business— Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”).”

**History**

Upfield was established in 2018, as a purpose-driven company with a clear vision: “To make people healthier
and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and good for our planet.”

While Upfield is a young company, our business traces its origin and heritage back over 150 years, when the
Jurgens family bought the patent for Plant Spreads. Many of our iconic power brands have brand heritage spanning over
100 years and under its prior ownership, our business evolved into one of the earliest large-scale producers of dairy
alternatives globally, focused on plant-based spreads.

Following the acquisition of Upfield by KKR in 2018, we began a journey to separate, transform and reinvent
the business, building on our existing strong foundations: a global platform with iconic power brands and world-class
knowledge. Building on these foundations and as a result of the significant industrial, digital and cultural transformation
undertaken since 2018, Upfield has established itself as a global leader in plant-based food, operating in multiple
categories with a global end-to-end supply chain.

At the outset, we formulated and adopted our Upfield manifesto, with a clear, purpose-driven vision and a datadriven mission to guide us as an independent company. During the last five years, we have invested over €1.6 billion to
reinvent our business: by simplifying, renovating and innovating our existing product portfolio, expanding into new
product categories and investing in our end-to-end supply chain while further investing and developing our IT system.

In the initial separation and stabilization phase, we exited more than 600 transitional service agreements that
were still in place from Upfield’s previous owner, built our fully digital, cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
system and completed the complex separation from Unilever to become a fully independent business by June 2020.

Prior to KKR’s ownership, Upfield’s business was largely focused on margarine. As a first step, we began
innovating our margarine and spreads business by working towards clean label products and developing palm oil-free
recipes. Gradually we shifted and expanded our category focus by developing and launching our Plant Butter offering,
specifically formulated to aim to replicate the performance and taste of dairy butter. By 2019, we reprioritized our Creams
and Liquids core categories and achieved volume growth in these categories. In January 2020, we expanded into the
Cheese category following the acquisition of Arivia, a leading producer of plant-based cheese through Violife.

Since 2018, we have undertaken a significant innovation and renovation program across our product portfolio,
introducing natural, plant-based ingredients and harmonizing and rationalizing the number of SKUs and recipes to focus
on fewer but better products. For example, we have upgraded and renovated a significant proportion of our product
portfolio since 2018, with approximately 85% of our European spreads sales in 2022 being from products renovated or
innovated since 2020, to retire SKUs which were less profitable or of low productivity, such that we operate with
approximately 1,200 active SKUs as of the third quarter of 2023 (down from 2,600 SKUs in 2018), excluding Plant
Cheeses. Furthermore, we restructured our portfolio of distinct recipes from over 340 distinct recipes for Plant Butter and
Spreads in Europe in 2018 to focus on 18 chassis. We harmonized and aligned our brand portfolio into key end-to-end
brand platforms which allows continued harmonization and efficiencies across our R&D and innovation pipeline and
supply chain.

Our innovation and food technology roadmap is led out of our Food Science Centre in Wageningen, the
Netherlands, which opened its doors in 2022 following an investment of approximately €38 million. Our Food Science
Centre leads our research and reformulation programs to continue simplifying our recipes, with an aim to deliver our bestever products from natural, plant-based ingredients which are better for consumers and better for the planet.

As a result of the above factors, our TAM across our four core categories, i.e., Butters and Spreads, Creams,
Liquids and Cheeses, has increased 15 times to approximately €151 billion in 2022 as compared to approximately €11
billion in 2017. Our expansion into the Butter, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses categories, in addition to Spreads, resulted
in an expansion of our TAM. While currently the penetration of plant-based products in the Butters, Creams and Cheeses

98


-----

categories is low, and estimated at less than 1%, there is a potential opportunity of approximately €23 billion (based on
an incremental €7 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 5% plant-based penetration) or €38 billion
(based on an incremental €22 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 16% plant-based penetration)
(see also “Industry—Upfield’s TAM”).

We optimized our supply chain footprint, closing five of our own manufacturing facilities including in
Nassakaude Rotterdam (the Netherlands), Rexdale (Canada) and Purfleet (the United Kingdom). At the same time, we
reinvested and modernized our footprint of 14 owned manufacturing facilities to support our growth objectives across our
core categories. In addition, we introduced a value creation program, which focusses on making our business more
efficient from an operational perspective and in particular through supply chain areas including, amongst others,
procurement, manufacturing and portfolio simplification. Since the implementation of this program in 2018, we have
realized approximately €415 million of costs savings in aggregate, with €90 million of cost savings achieved in 2023
alone.

Our journey since 2018 has taken place against a turbulent and volatile backdrop of events including a global
pandemic, associated supply chain challenges, commodity inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. Our transformation since
2018 was enabled by a purpose and performance-driven culture, which is carried by a passionate and engaged community
of approximately 4,800 “Upfielders”, consisting of our management team and employees. Our community of “Upfielders”
are aligned with our purpose, and are highly motivated to make an impact, deliver sustainable, purposeful long-term
growth and advance the transition to a plant-based food future.

**Products**

We are focused on four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses represented 81%, 8%, 4%
and 5% of our net sales, respectively. Sales outside of our core categories represented 2% of our net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2023. We compete against dairy and other plant-based offerings within these categories through our
plant-based products. These products are marketed through our portfolio of brands, comprising our power brands and
other local brands which cover a range of categories and price points across our markets.

**_Brands_**

Our brands are organized across end-to-end brand platforms which are founded upon key prerequisites of taste
and affordability, but each serves a distinct consumer need and is mapped against the key usage occasions and growth
opportunities across our categories and markets. Organizing our brands in this way also allows for continued and ongoing
harmonization and efficiencies across our R&D and innovation pipeline, sales and marketing and supply chain activities
with respect to our brands and products.

Our brand platforms are led by our power brands, our most iconic brands, which have a long history and heritage.
We believe that our power brands are deeply rooted and trusted by our consumers and customers across a number of our
markets and have high brand awareness in their respective markets. These brands include, for example, Flora (launched
in 1964 with a strong presence in the United Kingdom and increasingly other European markets), Country Crock
(launched in 1954 and present today in the United States), Becel +ProActiv (Becel launched in 1962 and ProActiv
launched in 2000 with a strong presence in European markets and Canada), Rama (launched in 1924 with a strong
presence in Germany), BlueBand (launched in 1916 and present today in the Netherlands, Indonesia and other markets
within AMEA) and Violife (which is a leading plant-based cheese brand globally, with an especially strong presence in
the United States and the United Kingdom, which are the leading plant-based cheese markets), acquired in 2020. Our
power brands accounted for the majority of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.

In addition to our power brands, we have a number of country or region specific brands with a strong local
heritage and brand awareness. Such local brands include for example, Lätta, a leading plant-based spreads brand in
Sweden, Tulipan, a popular brand of over 70 years in Spain, under which we offer Plant Butter and Spreads without any
palm oil, and Stork, which was launched more than 100 years ago and which has become a leading baking brand in the
United Kingdom.

Our brands and products are positioned across the price ladder in their markets with affordability being a key
focus. We organize our brands across three tiers: “good,” “better” and “best.” Each tier is strategically designed to meet
distinct consumer needs and certain price sensitivities, thereby catering to a wider audience. We believe that the “good,”
“better” and “best” pricing strategy simplifies consumer decision-making and strategically position each tier to appeal to
different segments. Brands that sit in the “good” tier target price-sensitive consumers in their respective markets with a
plant-based spread product and includes brands such as Imperial (the United States, Mexico), Rama (Germany), Stork

99


-----

(the United Kingdom), Delma (Poland and Hungary) and Lätta (Sweden). The “better” tier offers a broader product
offering and are therefore positioned at a slightly higher price point, attracting consumers who are looking for additional
product benefits but still affordable compared to the dairy alternative. Brands such as Country Crock (the United States),
Flora (the United Kingdom), Becel (Netherlands, Canada) and BlueBand (Indonesia, Netherlands) fall within the “better”
pricing tier. The “best” tier contains brands which offer a premium product for consumers, with multiple features and in
some cases health benefits, such as Becel +ProActiv which contains plant sterols which are clinically proven to lower
cholesterol. Brands such as Becel +ProActiv, Violife as well as some plant butter offerings in certain markets fall within
the “best” pricing tier. On average, our Plant Butter and Spreads cost 40% less compared to dairy alternatives.

**_Plant Butter and Spreads_**

We are a leading producer of plant-based butter and spreads. Our Plant Butter and Spreads are made from Plant
Oils, water, salt and protein and are suitable for key usage occasions including baking, cooking and spreading. For the
year ended December 31, 2023, our Plant Butter and Spreads represented 81% of our net sales.

Our Plant Butter is specifically formulated with the aim to match the performance and taste of dairy butter. It
contains six to seven natural ingredients including Plant Oils, plant-based proteins, natural flavourings, water and, in some
cases, salt. Our Plant Butter comes in a wrapper like dairy butter, which allows it to more effectively target the baking
and cooking occasion. Our Plant Spreads have been largely reformulated since 2018, introducing natural, plant-based
ingredients and harmonizing and rationalizing the number of SKUs and recipes to focus on fewer but better products. Our
Plant Spreads contain fat levels between approximately 20% to 75% depending on format and usage occasion. Whereas
our Plant Butter is specifically designed with the aim of replicating dairy butter in terms of both taste and functionality
for baking, cooking and spreading applications, our variety of plant spreads are more focused on specific usage occasions.
For example, depending on fat levels, our Plant Spreads may be most suitable for baking, cooking or spreading.

Our Plant Butter and Spreads cover a wide range of categories based on storage temperature, including (i) chilled
products, (ii) ambient products, which are solid at room temperature and (iii) tropical ambient products (for Plant Spreads),
which remain solid at the higher temperatures typically experienced in tropical climates. Our Plant Butter and Spreads
are also available in multiple formats suitable for a variety of occasions, including wrappers and tubs for spreading,
cooking and baking purposes, sachets for spreading and topping, as well as large format tubs and portion packs for the
foodservice industry.

Our Plant Butter and Spreads have several health and environmental advantages over dairy butter. One of their
benefits includes the higher Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid concentrations and zero trans-fat and lower saturated fat content
per serving. Additionally, the production of plant butter and spreads requires fewer resources and have a significantly
lower overall carbon footprint than dairy butter and other comparable dairy products. Our Plant Butter and Spreads
product lifecycle contributes approximately 70% less CO₂ emissions, need approximately 66% less land and need
approximately 50% less water than dairy equivalents.

**_Plant Creams_**

Our Plant Creams are alternatives to traditional dairy creams and can be used in the same way, for example, for
cooking, baking or topping. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our Plant Creams represented 8% of our net sales.

Our Plant Creams are made from Plant Oils, combined with proteins, emulsifiers and stabilizers. Some of our
cream products which are not 100% plant-based contain buttermilk and we intend to transition towards a 100% plantbased portfolio by 2030. Our creams portfolio currently includes cooking creams, double/whipping creams and sour
creams, and are packaged in a variety of formats including pots, bottles, pouches, tetra packs and pallecons for both our
retail and foodservice channels.

Our Plant Creams have several health and environmental advantages over dairy creams, including a longer shelf
life (reducing waste for customers and consumers), greater volume and stability in whipping, acid stable, heat stable and
allergen free (where 100% plant-based). Our Plant Creams also have a product lifecycle which requires fewer resources
and a lower overall carbon footprint, contributing approximately 50% less CO₂ emissions compared to dairy creams.

**_Liquids_**

Our liquids portfolio comprises culinary liquids, namely plant-based liquid margarines and sprays, which are
typically used for cooking and baking including for sautéing, frying, baking, grilling or as a topping. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, our Liquids represented 4% of our net sales. Our Liquids are derived from Plant Oils and are available
in both bottle and spray formats.

100


-----

Our Liquids contain all of the cooking benefits of dairy butter but without the commonly associated issue of
spattering. Our offering also contains zero trans-fats per serving.

**_Plant Cheeses_**

Our Plant Cheeses are alternatives to traditional dairy cheeses and can be used in the same way as dairy cheese.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, our Plant Cheeses represented 5% of our net sales.

Our Plant Cheeses are typically made from Plant Oils combined with starch and plant proteins and partially
fortified with Vitamin B12. Our Plant Cheeses portfolio covers a variety of styles, flavors, formats across hard, soft and
spreadable cheese including slices, blocks, grated, creamy and in a variety of flavors such as cheddar, gouda, mozzarella
and smoked.

Our Plant Cheeses have several health and environmental advantages over dairy cheeses, including being free
of allergens (including dairy, casein and lactose), cholesterol free and with zero trans-fats. Plant-based cheeses also have
a production lifecycle which requires fewer resources and a lower overall carbon footprint, contributing approximately
74% less CO₂ emissions compared to dairy cheeses.

**Channels and Regions**

Our operations span three regions, namely Europe, the Americas and AMEA. We sell our products across those
regions primarily through retail channels, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and other outlets. In
addition, in emerging markets in which we operate across our regions, we have established a strong market channel based
on deep relationships with well-known and reputable distributors. We additionally operate a foodservice channel, which
sells products to commercial outlets, such as quick service restaurants, bakeries, pizza and pasta outlets, hotels, catering
and industrial kitchens and to the social sector, such as educational institutions, workplaces and hospitals. Retail sales
represented 89% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our foodservice channel represented 11%
of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023.

In the retail channel, we operate as the supplier of choice and/or “category captain” for certain strategic retailers,
providing in-depth knowledge and consumer insight for particular product categories to our retailer customers. As is
typical in the food industry, we do not have long-term contractual commitments with our key customers. Instead, we enter
into bespoke joint business plans with customers, which usually encompass pricing, trade terms, support for new
innovation, assortment, distribution and shelf space. In some markets, the agreements also include promotional activity
for the year, although in most markets it is still possible to change promotional activity and pricing during the year. We
have also developed relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco, Amazon
and Carrefour online, which have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe represent
a significant growth opportunity in the regions in which we operate, especially in Europe and the Americas.

Our foodservice business operates in 76 countries across Europe, the Americas and AMEA. Approximately 44%
of our foodservice net sales come from the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Germany, Sweden and Mexico. Given this market
concentration, we believe there is significant room to expand our foodservice geographical footprint. Moreover, we
believe there is considerable potential in the foodservice channel for our core product categories given our current product
portfolio, and in particular its appeal across the foodservice value pyramid and the menu adoption cycle. Our growth
strategy in foodservice is focused on selling value-add branded products with high-demand applications to commercial
customers and driving customer acquisition through our chef-led sales approach (see also “—Sales and Marketing”).

**_Europe_**

The Europe region comprises our operations in continental Europe, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom and
Ireland, and we have a sales presence in 39 European countries. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our operations
in Europe accounted for €1,599 million of net sales, representing 48.8% of our total net sales for the same period.

**For the year ended**

**Our three largest markets by net sales are:** **December 31, 2023**

_(% of total net_

Germany .................................................................................................... 290 18.1%
The Netherlands ......................................................................................... 170 10.6%

101


-----

Europe is predominantly a direct-led market with mainly retail (modern trade) customers. These operations are
underpinned by our strong brand and product portfolio and longstanding relationships with leading retailers across
Europe. We have simplified our operations in Europe since 2018, moving from 12 clusters to 4, namely the Northern
cluster (the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Nordics and the Baltics), the South-west cluster (Belgium, Netherlands, France,
Spain and Portugal), the Central and Eastern cluster (Poland, Ukraine, Eastern Europe, Greece and Cyprus) and DACHIT
cluster (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy).

According to NielsenIQ measurement data, we hold leading positions in the retail butter and spreads segment in
many of our European markets, the retail creams segment in Germany and the United Kingdom and a leading position in
the retail plant cheese segment in the United Kingdom.

**_The Americas_**

The Americas region comprises our operations in the United States, Canada and LatAm, and we are present in
20 countries in the Americas. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our operations in the Americas accounted for €1,319
million of net sales, representing 40.3% of our total net sales for the same period.

**For the year ended**

**Our three largest markets by net sales are:** **December 31, 2023**

The North America region (the United States and Canada) is predominantly a direct market with mainly retail
(modern trade) customers. LatAm, in contrast, is predominantly served through distributors because of its geography and
customer fragmentation, including the prevalence of traditional trade customers throughout the region. Mexico is the
largest market within LatAm, and is evenly split between distributor (traditional trade) customers and retail (modern
trade) customers.

Our operations are underpinned by our strong brand portfolio and longstanding relationships with leading
retailers and well-known and reputable distributors across the Americas. According to NielsenIQ measurement data, we
hold the leading position in the retail butter and spreads segment in North America and a number one position in the retail
plant cheese segment in the United States.

**_AMEA_**

The AMEA region comprises our operations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and we are present in 47
AMEA countries. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our operations in AMEA accounted for €357 million of net
sales, representing 10.9% of our total net sales for the same period.

The AMEA region is predominantly a distributor-led market and there has been a significant consolidation of
our distributor base since 2019, especially in Indonesia and Pakistan. Our operations are underpinned by our strong brand
portfolio and longstanding relationships with well-known and reputable distributors across AMEA. Our AMEA business
is organized into six main clusters, namely, (i) Indonesia, (ii) South East and Far East Asia, (iii) South Asia, (iv) Turkey

102

and Central Asia, (v) the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), (vi) Africa and (vii) Australia, New Zealand and the
Pacific Islands.

According to NielsenIQ measurement data, we hold leading positions in the retail butter and spreads segment in
our two key markets, Indonesia and Turkey. These leading positions are supported by our high degree of brand awareness
and strong relationships with reputable distributors.

**Competition**

We are a global leader in plant-based food. While there are other local and regional producers of plant-based
products, we are strongly positioned in the market of plant butter and spreads, plant creams and plant cheeses. See
“Industry.” Our plant-based products face competition from alternative products such as dairy butter, cooking oils,
traditional dairy creams and animal-based cheeses and sweet spreads amongst others.

The competitive dynamics in our industry are, in particular, driven by changing consumer trends, demands and
preferences. These include dietary, health and environmental concerns and trends, such as increasing awareness of
different nutritional aspects of foods and the health effects and sourcing practices relating to specific ingredients, an
increasing preference for dairy-free, vegan and organic food ingredients, trends towards eating and baking outside of
home and concerns regarding public health consequences associated with obesity and increasing awareness of the
environmental and social effects of production (in particular those related to palm oil, which is a key ingredient in many
products across our portfolio). See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Changes in Food Trends and Consumer Preferences” and_
“Industry—Key Trends” for a description of changes in food trends and consumer preferences affecting our business.

**Sales and Marketing**

We aim to solidify and enhance our market-leading brand awareness and increase penetration of plant-based
food in our core categories by leveraging our brand heritage and our products’ ability to meet key consumer purchasing
criteria with respect to taste, functionality, health and nutrition, sustainability and affordability. By building and
supporting our brands, we believe we can educate and inspire consumers to move to plant-based foods. Over the years,
we have introduced millions of consumers to our plant-based products. For example, in 2023, we reached an additional
55 million consumers based on household penetration data by country and product sales (bringing us to approximately
261 million consumers reached as of December 31, 2023), which is a significant contribution to our goal of “inspiring the
shift” and reaching one billion people with our plant-based products by 2030.

Our sales teams are organized by region and local market, with overall strategic guidance and direction provided
at a global level in line with our overall corporate strategy. Regional sales teams are responsible for regional sales and
promotional strategy, and alongside local teams plan the end-to-end sales process and activities across sales planning,
sales execution and sales promotion activities. Local teams manage day-to-day operations and execution in both retail
and foodservice channels and manage customer relationships and, where relevant, distributor relationships.

Our marketing function is led by dedicated marketing teams in each region and lead markets, with overall
strategic guidance and communications support provided at a central level in line with our overall corporate strategy. The
regional marketing leads are responsible for developing the overall marketing and strategy and work closely with our
markets units, sales, supply chain and R&D teams to support sales and operational planning, and execute our overall
marketing strategy in line with our overall objectives. This includes engaging with customers on promotional displays
and merchandising, as well as planning key marketing and promotional campaigns and providing key consumer insights
and intelligence across the business. This is supported by our interactive data visualization Power BI platform and key
consumer and market insight data from brand experts engaged by us, amongst other initiatives.

Through targeted campaigns and consumer engagement, we work to increase public knowledge of how our
products can contribute to healthier, more sustainable diets. This year, we have continued to develop new and innovative
marketing campaigns like “Skip the Cow” and the #MakeItPlant campaign to drive consumers, chefs and foodservice
providers to choose more plant-based options. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign, initially under the Flora brand, was meant
to inspire the shift to plant-based products and promote the benefits of our Plant Butter which has approximately 75%
less climate impact in terms of CO₂ emissions than dairy butter. Since the launch of the campaign at the beginning of
2023, sales volumes of Flora Plant Butter have increased by more than 59% in the United Kingdom for the year ended
December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, Flora Plant Butter experienced
growth in household penetration and share of segment in the United Kingdom. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign has pushed
the uptake of Flora Plant and has proved to be a valuable resource in boosting consumer awareness and positive net
sentiment (86%) towards our Flora brand. Following the success of the “Skip the Cow” campaign in the United Kingdom,

we launched similar campaigns across European markets, such as Germany and Austria, and have started to also roll it
out to other key markets such as the Netherlands, Poland or Spain, and also across other brands.

**R&D**

We believe that our R&D capability and knowledge is a key enabler of competitive advantage in our drive to
continuously push for innovation in plant-based food in our categories. We believe we have an industry leading R&D
function that underpins our ability to produce new and innovative products using key ingredient know-how, technically
sophisticated equipment and processes across our core categories and products. As an insights-driven organization we
seek to continually enhance consumer experience with respect to taste, functionality, health and nutrition, sustainability
and affordability by developing relevant product and packaging innovation. We leverage our knowledge and know-how
of key enabling technologies which are relevant across our brand platforms, core categories and products.

We continue to invest significantly in food innovation and food technology expertise. In the year ended
December 31, 2023, our R&D expenditure represented approximately 1% of our net sales. Additionally, we invested
approximately €38 million in our new, state-of-the-art Food Science Centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands, which
opened its doors in 2022 and which we believe is the largest pure-play plant-based food center in the world. Our Food
Science Centre is a dedicated R&D facility solely focused on plant-based food innovation and pioneering the development
of plant-based foods and sustainable packaging solutions. The Food Science Centre is at the heart of Food Valley around
the Wageningen University and Research campus in the Netherlands, and sits at the core of a leading agri-food ecosystem
where there is a deep pool of food science talent and relevant partners across the food value chain. Our team of more than
150 food scientists, food technologists and R&D specialists, including packaging experts, have delivered an upgraded
and simplified portfolio of products that offer consumers choice and are designed to compete effectively against plant and
dairy products alike across our four core categories. Our team continues to not only develop plant-based foods but also
sustainable packaging solutions. We are a leading filer of plant-based patents, and hold 656 patents and patent
applications, with 19 new patents filed between 2018 and 2023 (with ten patent applications filed in 2023 alone) and 11
new patent families filed since 2018 across our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams and Plant Cheeses categories.

In addition, our R&D team, in collaboration with Footprint LLC, a company that develops and manufactures
plant-based fiber solutions and whose material sciences technology we have been using, have designed and developed a
paper tub that is durable, recyclable and visually attractive. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging
technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand, with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in
early 2024.

As well as innovating internally, we partner with academia, established ingredients and packaging players, startups and scale-ups whose differentiated propositions can complement our R&D capabilities and our ability to scale through
our distribution channels, platform and growth levers. In 2023, along with industry peers, we formed an industry
consortium from the total protein value chain in the Netherlands on a new project, called “the FabaFood project”, to
advance plant-based protein innovation. For the FabaFood project, which is supported by Efro Oost (a subsidy program
for Dutch companies), we will partner on developing new, food-grade varieties of the fava bean, as well as innovative
methods of protein extraction and processing. These new proteins can then be incorporated into a range of dairy substitutes
that deliver enhanced performance across taste, color, texture and cost.

We are particularly focused on leveraging these partnerships and broader collaborations across the food
technology ecosystem to execute our R&D roadmap across Plant Butter, Plant Creams and Plant Cheeses in particular.

**Strategic Partnerships**

We believe we are a key player in the food technology ecosystem, partnering across the full system from
academia and start-ups to scale-ups and suppliers. These strategic partnerships offer differentiated propositions which
complement our R&D capabilities and our ability to scale through our distribution channels, and allow us to grow our
position in the professional food sector.

**_Heura Foods_**

In November 2023, we entered into a strategic partnership with Heura Foods, a Spanish plant-based start-up that
produces sustainable and nutritious plant-based meat products, taking a minority stake in the company. We are partnering
with Heura Foods to develop food technology and collaborate on product definition, production, and distribution. This
partnership aims to create superior products via disruptive technology, bringing together Heura Foods’ cutting-edge
technologies and our expertise and innovation as regards plant-based food products.

-----

**_Change Foods_**

In February 2022, we entered into a strategic partnership with Change Foods, a California-based company
pioneering the development of a unique precision fermentation process, thereby securing a minority stake in the Change
Foods business. Their process creates nature-identical dairy casein proteins, which is the fundamental building block of
all dairy cheeses.

**_Alfred’s_**

In November 2022, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Alfred’s FoodTech Ltd, an Israeli food-tech
company, taking a minority stake. Alfred’s has an innovative process and technology and, as part of our collaboration,
we will explore working together with the aim of improving the taste, functionality and nutritional profile of our Plant
Cheeses.

**_OGGS®_**

We acquired a minority stake, through investments since 2022, in Alternative Foods, a UK-based plant-based
egg alternative producer and leading vegan bakery, which markets its products under the OGGS® brand. We are working
together with the OGGS® team to expand the plant-based egg substitute market, and create allergen-free products that
deliver on taste, nutrition and sustainability.

**Procurement**

Our procurement function sits within our global supply chain function and is led by our Chief Procurement
Officer. We operate a predominantly centralized procurement function designed to leverage our purchasing expertise and
maximize scale efficiencies across the regions where we operate. Our procurement function has a deep understanding of
commodity cycles and risk management, and many years of experience in the oils market. Sourcing strategy, commodities
risk management, hedging and procurement value creation are designed and managed by the central procurement team,
which is also responsible for the sourcing of Plant Oils. Regional procurement teams are responsible for sourcing of other
inputs and materials and supplier management. We source most of our food ingredients and packaging materials from
global suppliers who can deliver locally, and our supply chain is aligned with our geographic footprint, enabling us to
optimize our supply arrangements and minimize logistics costs. We have developed strong, long-standing relationships
with our major suppliers of key raw materials, many of which have been in place for over a decade.

The principal ingredient in our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses are refined
Plant Oils (such as rapeseed oil (approximately 33% of our total Plant Oils volume and of which the majority is sourced
from Europe), soybean oil (approximately 17% of our total Plant Oils volume and of which the majority is sourced from
North America), sunflower oil (approximately 5% of our total Plant Oils volume and which we entirely source from
Europe), palm oil, palm kernel oil, derivatives and fractions (approximately 36% of our total Plant Oils volume and of
which the majority is sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia) and coconut oil (approximately 6% of our total Plant Oils
volume and of which the majority is sourced from the Philippines)), in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Additional primary materials used in our production process include other ingredients and packaging materials. Our risk
management mechanisms include the use of physical stocks. futures, forward contracts, derivatives and other financial
hedging transactions to provide certainty and insulate the business from short term price volatility across a majority of its
input commodities, with initiatives underway to expand the scope of such measures to cover packaging material costs as
well.

In addition, we are committed to responsible and sustainable sourcing of all our ingredients and our Responsible
Sourcing Policy, Human Rights Policy and Business Partner Code of Conduct applies to all our suppliers. Our target is
to be 100% deforestation free and conversion free by 2025. Since October 2019, all of the palm oil directly purchased by
us is certified (segregated and mass balance), which means that our supply chain has been assessed against strict criteria
set-out by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). In 2023, we achieved a score of 8.5 (out of 10) on the RSPO’s
Shared Responsibility Scorecard, placing us in the top 4% of companies demonstrating sustainable leadership in palm oil
sourcing. Beyond sourcing certified (segregated and mass balance) palm oil, we partner with independent experts like
Earthworm and use satellite technology to monitor our supply chains. This satellite technology enables us to monitor the
sources of the palm oil we purchase, which in turn allows us to address deforestation risks with our supply chain partners.
We continue to innovate and create new recipes both with sustainable palm and alternatives to palm oil, namely through
our patented palm oil-free technology. We have also taken significant steps in increasing the transparency of our coconut
oil supply chain. After joining the Sustainable Coconut Charter in January 2022, we ran a supplier assessment and policy

105


-----

review. By the end of 2022, 100% of our coconut oil suppliers agreed with our policy and started to share their countrylevel traceability with us, which gives us the visibility to ensure sustainability throughout our supply chains. Furthermore,
we continue to maintain our policy commitments for certified paper sourcing (Financial Services Compensation Scheme
(“FSC”)/Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification “PEFC”) and ensuring soybean oil is sourced in compliance
with the Amazon Soy Moratorium Agreement.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, materials, which include Plant Oils, other ingredients, flavors, finished
goods from third-party manufacturers and packaging materials, represented 67% of our total cost of sales.

**Manufacturing**

We own a total of 14 manufacturing facilities, of which 13 are operated by us, comprising seven manufacturing
facilities in Europe, four manufacturing facilities in the Americas and three manufacturing facilities in AMEA (see table
below). The Tultitlán, Mexico facility is currently owned by us and operated by Unilever, with the operational transition
from Unilever to us in progress. These facilities produced approximately 91% of our total production volume for the year
ended December 31, 2023. In addition, we have strategic relationships with select third-party manufacturers, which
produced approximately 9% of our total production volume for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our relationships with
third-party manufacturers are predominantly focused in AMEA and LatAm and where markets are more fragmented
and/or where there is a greater distance to our own manufacturing facilities. For example, we have a long-term strategic
contract with GrainCorp, who is the only manufacturer of our products sold within Australia and New Zealand. We
believe that our global network of manufacturing facilities provides us with exceptional outreach to local markets while
maintaining quality and efficiency through scale.

The following table sets out the key attributes of our manufacturing facilities during the year ended December
31, 2023.

Notes:

(1) “Other” includes specific site capabilities, e.g. olive oil in Piraeus, Greece.

(2) Tultitlán, Mexico facility is currently owned by us and operated by Unilever, with the operational transition from Unilever to us in progress.

Our manufacturing facilities are focused on in-house manufacturing of a wide range of our product offering
along with multiple packaging options. We have invested significantly in our supply chain and manufacturing facilities
since 2018 including in new capacity and capabilities for the production of plant butter and spreads and plant cheeses,
maintenance, consolidation and value creation improvements. Although capacity differs by product category and facility
as a result of this investment, we have significant spare capacity available through our network to accommodate future
growth in our core product categories, including planned expansion in the private label and foodservice segments, as well
as to respond to seasonal fluctuations.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, production costs, which also include labor, electricity, gas, depreciation
and other related costs represented 12% of our total cost of sales.

**Distribution**

We operate an asset-light distribution model that carefully manages our outbound supply chain and allocates
products manufactured in our manufacturing facilities to our distribution centers (primary distribution) and subsequently
to our retailers and foodservice customers (secondary distribution). We have a global cold chain logistics network

106


-----

comprising 37 distribution centers, of which three are owned by us, which is broadly aligned with our manufacturing
footprint in the regions in which we operate. We outsource the operation of the majority of these distribution centers to
third-party logistics partners, with the exception of our centers in Helsingborg (Sweden), Pratau (Germany) and Corlu
(Turkey), which we operate ourselves given their strategic location, capabilities and expertise.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, logistics costs, which include transportation, warehousing and other
logistics costs, represented 15% of our total cost of sales.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 4,800 employees across the world.

We believe that our employees are critical to our success. To nurture an engaged workforce, we complete an
annual survey to gauge employee sentiment and opportunities for progress. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our
overall employee engagement score was 7.8 (as compared to 7.5 in 2022), bringing us with four points of the top quartile
of consumer companies and our employee net promoter score (eNPS), which seeks to measure employee satisfaction, was
33 (as compared to 25 in 2022). Our goal is to reach an employee engagement score of more than 8.1 by 2030.

We offer comprehensive training for employees throughout the business, equipping them with the skills they
need to develop and grow, and helping them realize their aspirations. For instance, we recently launched the Upside
program, a leadership development program for our employees. We also launched “Come As You Are” workshops to
inspire respectful, inclusive behaviors and greater understanding of diversity, equity and inclusion among our leadership
team. We plan to undertake similar sessions for our manufacturing facility-based workforce in 2024.

**Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”)**

Sustainability is at the heart of Upfield and is central to our purpose, our products and our end-to-end supply
chain. We have made substantial investments to reach some of the industry’s highest levels of sustainable sourcing,
including our sustainable palm oil practices. As a leader in plant-based foods, we are driven by our purpose to transform
the global food system in partnership with our customers, suppliers, and stakeholders across our value chain. Our ESG
strategy was developed to address our material impacts and opportunities, recognizing the need for rapid action to
collectively address the challenges of the climate crisis, nature loss, population growth, and human health by enabling the
transition to a sustainable food system.

In 2023, we continued to implement our strategy and put our purpose “to make people healthier and happier with
nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and good for our planet” into action to deliver
positive impact across our four pillars: (i) plant-based, (ii) healthier lives, (iii) happier people and (iv) better planet. For
each pillar of our ESG strategy, we have defined an overarching goal, supported by a series of commitments through
which we track progress.

**_Plant-Based_**

The first pillar of our ESG strategy, plant-based, is dedicated to inspiring more people to eat plant-based food.
Our role is to ensure that, through our brands, we offer a range of options that meet consumer needs. This includes seeking
to ensure that our products taste great, perform well, are better for consumers and are made with simple and natural
ingredients.

We aim to reach one billion people with our products by 2030. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we
estimate that we reached approximately 261 million consumers, based on household penetration data by country and
product sales, with our plant-based products, an increase of 55 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

In addition, we want to deliver a 100% plant-based product portfolio by 2030. Whilst we are already over 99%
dairy-free, dairy ingredients have the highest carbon impact of the ingredients in our portfolio and make a disproportionate
contribution to our total carbon footprint. As such, we have continued to invest in research and reformulation programs
that have cut dairy ingredients by 1.5 kiloton since 2022. Another one of our commitments is to have an all-natural
ingredients product portfolio by 2030. We want to create recipes with natural ingredients, with simple, clean labels.
Currently, 99% of our ingredients are natural and during 2023, we have continued our investments in R&D to simplify
our recipes and aim to deliver the best-ever products created by us, with natural ingredients. In addition, in recent periods,
a key focus area has been to transition artificial colors and artificial flavors to natural ones.

In addition to advancing our own efforts, we are working to support the industry forward in terms of plant-based
innovation, which includes establishing standard parameters for what plant-based means. We are currently leading the

107


-----

development of a new ISO standard that will specify technical definitions of, and criteria for, plant-based foods. We
believe that this new ISO standard will help align the global food industry around a single terminology approach.

**_Healthier Lives_**

The second pillar of our ESG strategy focuses on the nutritional benefits of our products as well as their positive
contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and a key reason why people choose our products. For the
year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 30% of our net sales came from products that provide health and nutrition
benefits and can be labelled as such in compliance with regulations. This includes products with lower saturated fat and
no trans-fat per serving and plant sterols for heart health, the addition of vitamins, calcium, Omega 3 and 6 and lower
calorie options, which support functional health.

We take a science-based approach to establishing criteria and targets for each product type we sell, considering
who uses them, how frequently and in which applications. In 2023, we continued to expand our nutritional benchmarking
program, following its launch in 2022, based on what science tells us is required for each different product proposition
and which introduced saturated fat and trans-fat targets for plant creams and plant cheeses. As a result, over 91% of our
sold volume met or exceeded our benchmarks for the year ended December 31, 2023. These targets are based on
recognized external international standards and official dietary recommendations, including those from the World Health
Organization. We have set additional targets that ensure we can deliver the desired nutritional composition. These include
considerations for how we can limit nutrients of concern and provide essential nutrients that target some of the critical
public health areas of concern, including heart health and children’s growth and development.

We believe the future of food lies in quality, responsibly made, plant-based foods. To realize that future, we need
to ensure our products are accessible to as many people as possible, which includes ensuring our products come in at
affordable price points. Globally, our Plant Butter and Spreads remain significantly more affordable than their dairy
counterparts. This is true compared to private label dairy butter and even more so compared to branded dairy butter. In
the United States, our Imperial brand offers a strong value-for-money proposition for value-seeking consumers. One of
our commitments is to maintain such affordability, especially for consumers in lower socio-economic groups.

Additionally, we seek to positively impact people’s lives, including by educating children on nutrition and by
enabling heart health and improving functional health. For example, under our brand BlueBand we implemented a
program “Sarapan Berisi BlueBand” (“Nutritious Breakfast with BlueBand”) for children across Indonesia in 2023. The
goal of this program was to inspire families to prioritize healthy breakfasts by demonstrating the connection between
good nutrition, particularly Omega 3 and 6 intake, enhanced school performance and greater success throughout life. Our
brand Becel +ProActiv has always championed heart health and is clinically proven to lower blood cholesterol. During
2023, we launched several marketing campaigns to heighten brand awareness and encourage consumers to commence
actions to ensure heart health later on. In Brazil, our Não Deixe Para Depois (“Don’t Leave It for Later”) campaign,
which featured an engaging video about Becel +ProActiv, reached approximately 37 million people in 2023. Also, we
expanded our market penetration in 2023, launching Becel +ProActiv in Saudi Arabia and therewith enabling more people
to access heart-healthier choices.

**_Happier People_**

Our third ESG pillar is based on our belief that people are happier when they are engaged and so we actively
promote a culture of active support. In addition to our employees, we are committed to supporting our wider community
of stakeholders, including our suppliers and farmers.

To nurture an engaged workforce, we complete an annual survey to gauge employee sentiment and opportunities
for progress. See also “—Employees.” In 2021, we set the target of a 50/50 gender split by 2030, with a focus on managers
and above. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we achieved approximately 43% women representation at management
level and 38% across the entire workforce. In addition, in 2022, we began developing the “Women in Finance and IT”
program to level gender representation in finance and IT, which aims to advance female finance and IT professionals
through bespoke training, peer-to-peer support, expert guidance and mindfulness tools. While the program was still in its
first year, for the year ended December 31, 2023, female representation reached 45% (up from 44% in 2022) in our finance
functions and 33% (up from 28% in 2022) in IT functions.

In addition, we want to support our communities through employee volunteering. For the year ended December
31, 2023, we reached 5,646 hours of employee volunteering, an increase of 18% compared to the year ended December
31, 2022. We are committed to reach 15,000 hours of employee volunteering annually.

108


-----

Across our supply chains, we are connected to thousands of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs who grow
our ingredients and chefs who create and prepare millions of meals every day. In support of farmers and plant-based
entrepreneurs, we maintain several partnerships, enabling and encouraging them to improve agricultural practices and
access to markets. For example, to reduce emissions and support sustainable farming practices, we have teamed up with
Regrow Ag, an agricultural technology company. By using their technology, we can analyse the environmental impacts
of our North American soy, canola and sunflower supply chains. This allows us to develop an increasingly accurate and
meaningful emissions reduction strategy and identify opportunities to implement regenerative agriculture practices in our
supply chains, directing investments to farmers to support emissions reductions and climate resilience. This, in turn, will
drive progress towards our wider Science Based Target initiative (“SBTi”) commitment while increasing our ability to
source sustainable, responsible, plant-based ingredients (see also “—Better Planet”). In addition, we seek to reach as
many chefs and food service professionals as possible to encourage the adoption of our products into their cooking,
thereby engaging chefs in the plant-based revolution. For example, in May 2023, our MENA (Middle East and North
Africa) team hosted a cooking workshop in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia whereby a number of local chefs came together to learn
about our brands and how they can be incorporated into recipes. The workshop also served as a platform to launch new
products to the Saudi Arabian market, including Violife cheeses and Rama cream.

**_Better Planet_**

The goal guiding our fourth ESG pillar is “to pioneer food,” that is, we want to be on the forefront of creating
food that is better for the planet by showcasing the benefit of plant-based products while reducing our carbon footprint.
Our better planet commitments include our environmental targets to address our material environmental impacts on the
climate, on packaging and on responsible sourcing. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we committed to SBTi and
have worked on redefining our targets in line with the newly published Forest, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) guidance
to align with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We also made progress on the
reduction of our Scope 1 emissions (i.e., direct emissions owned or controlled by a company) and Scope 2 emissions (i.e.,
indirect emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling). For the year ended December 31,
2023, the carbon impact of our manufacturing facilities, representing the majority of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, was
reduced by 16.7%, in absolute emissions, through the implementation of our decarbonization plan focused on improving
energy efficiency and shifting to lower-carbon and renewable energy sources. One example of our decarbonization plan
is the installation of a modern steam boiler room in our Polish (Katowice) manufacturing facility in 2023, helping us to
move away from coal-fired steam as a fuel source in our manufacturing process. By upgrading the Polish (Katowice)
manufacturing facility plant boiler, we expect to reduce our emissions by approximately 6,800 tonnes annually.

Our Scope 3 emissions (i.e., emissions not covered by Scope 1 and 2 emissions, created by a company’s value
chain) plan focuses on the biggest drivers of our footprint, namely ingredients, packaging and logistics. We have made
progress across Scope 3 emissions in our supply chain, driven by reformulation, dairy elimination, recycled packaging
increases and changes in the mix of our portfolio, delivering a 13% reduction in absolute emissions in the year. For the
year ended December 31, 2023, over 62% of our carbon footprint came from ingredients. Dairy, for example, which
accounts for just less than 1% of our ingredients, represented over 5% of our carbon impact, making removing it from
our portfolio an important step towards reducing our emissions. Since 2020, we have reduced dairy-related carbon
emissions, including methane, by over 43% as we have continued to develop more plant-based recipes.

Beside emissions, we are reducing environmental impact through waste and water management at our
manufacturing facilities. For example, our manufacturing facility in Drama, Greece, is reducing environmental impact
through a new wastewater treatment plant that will ensure manufacturing facility outflow is safe and clean. The facility
has been designed for high operational efficiency, reducing the chemicals and energy needed to treat wastewater. It will
also reduce the volume of sludge created as a by-product by up to 95% while ensuring any effluent continues to meet
relevant environmental standards. In addition, we are targeting a 100% zero waste to landfill by 2030. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, 85%, or 11, of our manufacturing facilities achieved zero waste to landfill, with an absolute reduction
of 11.9% and over 150% increase in reused waste versus 2022.

Moreover, we are committed to providing packaging that protects our products and the planet. Wherever we
incorporate paper-based materials into packaging, we look to do so responsibly in line with our responsible sourcing of
paper and pulp policy. We maintain high levels of recyclability for our packaging format and have continued to increase
our recycled content. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 93% of our packaging is recyclable, reusable or
compostable. Our packaging goals are intended to reduce environmental impact without compromising quality and
performance. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging technology in Austria under our Flora Plant
brand, with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in early 2024. This innovation marks the
beginning of our transition to a paper solution across our portfolio, furthering our aim to reduce plastic content by 80%
by 2030. Initially launched in Austria with Flora Plant, we expect further scaling of our paper solution, aiming to replace
up to two billion plastic tubs by 2030, avoiding more than 25,000 tons of plastic waste per year. In addition, we are

109


-----

committed to introduce carbon labelling to 500 million packs of our Plant Butter and Creams by the end of 2025. Between
2021 and 2023, we achieved over 817 million carbon labels, significantly exceeding our target.

In addition, we are committed to responsible and sustainable sourcing of all our ingredients and our Responsible
Sourcing Policy, Human Rights Policy and Business Partner Code of Conduct applies to all our suppliers. Where key
ingredients are identified as potentially high risk, we maintain strong individual policies designed to address the potential
risks inherent in these supply chains, particularly focussing on deforestation and exploitation. One area of particular focus
is palm oil, and all our palm oil is certified (segregated and mass balance) by the RSPO. Beyond certification, we continue
to use satellite monitoring and have robust grievance management processes to proactively address issues in palm oil
supply chains. We are also enhancing our efforts in other areas, including building a more sustainable coconut oil supply
chain. We are a member of the Sustainable Coconut Partnership, an organization dedicated to making the coconut sector
more resilient and responsible. Additionally, from 2024 onwards, we will begin sourcing Rainforest Alliance-certified
coconut oil. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 100% of our palm oil and soybean oil were sustainably sourced with
RSPO certification for our palm oil and 100% of our paper and pulp supply was sustainably sourced with a 100% PEFC
or FSC certification.

**Health and Safety**

Our employees’ safety is our foremost priority in line with our “goal zero” vision to achieve zero serious
workplace safety incidents. Furthermore, we believe that the health and safety of agency workers, engineering contractors,
service providers and all those who visit our manufacturing facilities or offices is also paramount.

We have established a strong culture that goes beyond legal compliance, maintaining occupational health and
safety management system requirements that apply to every manufacturing facility and office. These requirements are
outlined in our framework standards on occupational health & safety policy. To support implementation thereof, we
developed a training module called WorkSafe for office-based employees. The module is designed to help them identify
and prevent potential hazards, and to respond appropriately to any safety-related situations. In 2023, we also introduced
our life-saving rules policy, which comprises six rules that apply across our business to prevent fatal or permanently
disabling injuries. We also introduced the “courage to care” program to build a culture that encourages employees,
contractors and visitors to care by reporting safety issues. As a result of such programs, three of our manufacturing
facilities (Piraeus, Greece; Cikarang, Indonesia; and Nairobi, Kenya) had zero workplace accidents over the last three
years.

**Intellectual Property**

Maintaining adequate brand protection is of significant importance to our business as we rely on our brands to
implement our business strategy. We have an extensive trademark portfolio with approximately 3,303 trademarks across
all of our regions. We also hold 656 patents and patent applications, with 19 new patents filed between 2018 and 2023
(with ten patent applications filed in 2023 alone) and 11 new patent families filed since 2018 across our Plant Butter and
Spreads, Plant Creams and Plant Cheeses (relating to plant proteins as well as Plant Oils and fats). In addition, we hold
81 design registrations and 810 domain names spread across our regions. Our intellectual property is managed centrally,
and we work closely with a third party agency in respect of filings, renewals, recordings and the prosecution and
enforcement of intellectual property matters internationally.

**Insurance**

We carry insurance that we believe to be common in our industry and sufficient to cover the principal risks of
damage to our business. We maintain, where appropriate, insurance with respect to liability of our directors and officers,
property damage, business interruption, cold storage facilities, public liability, products liability, product recall, damage
to vehicles, personal accident, travel, employer liability and worker safety and compensation. We undertake periodic risk
reviews to assess whether our insurance is in line with our business risks and whether the developments in insurance
policies are reflective of the changes in our business.

**Litigation**

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to litigation. Except as set forth in this
Offering Memorandum, there were no proceedings ongoing, pending or to our knowledge, threatened, that are expected
to have a material adverse impact on the Group as a whole.

Since 2022, Upfield US Inc. (“Upfield US”), a Group company, has been named as a defendant in or threatened
with alleged putative class action lawsuits. The claims generally allege that Upfield US has engaged in misleading
labelling and advertising of its products and violated various state consumer fraud and deceptive business practice acts.

The plaintiffs seek to certify classes of individuals who have purchased the named products in certain states within the
United States. While several of these actions have been dismissed based on a motion to dismiss filed by Upfield US, other
actions are pending.

**Corporate Governance and Responsibility**

Good corporate governance is at the core of our business model and our systems of governance have been
designed to provide the necessary checks and balances between management and employees, as well as between the
executive committee, other managers and our shareholders.

Our executive committee takes care of our day-to-day management. The Board, together with the executive
committee, forms the key management of the Group. We promote a diversity culture and have a long-term objective of
having a 50:50 gender balance by 2030 at management level and above (including executive committee members). As of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are five male members and two female executive committee members.

In addition, the Board has established an Audit Committee to assist in carrying out its functions. The executive
committee has established five committees to assist in carrying out its function and help reach its objectives: (i) the
Enterprise Risk Management Committee, (ii) Compliance Committee, (iii), the ESG Committee, (iv) the Information
Security Committee and (v) the Remuneration Committee.

**_Audit Committee_**

Our Audit Committee monitors risk exposure and appetite, reviews the effectiveness of our management and
internal control frameworks and approves the assurance program, which is the internal and external audit planning. Within
the Audit Committee, we have an Internal Audit Division that supports the Audit Committee in evaluating the
effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies and internal controls implemented by the executive committee.

**_Enterprise Risk Management Committee_**

We established an Enterprise Risk Management Committee that is responsible for (i) coordinating and
developing risk management processes, (ii) assessing the level of risk related to achieving strategic objectives and (iii)
overseeing execution and implementation of control into operational plans.

The Enterprise Risk Management Committee, together with the Compliance Committee, regularly reviews the
risks and decisions that could have a material impact on the Group. These reviews consider the level of risk that the Group
is prepared to take in pursuit of the business strategy and the effectiveness of the management controls in place to mitigate
risk exposure.

114


-----

**_Compliance Committee_**

The Compliance Committee reviews specific compliance matters escalated for further consideration and
provides broader supervision of our compliance program. We established several compliance frameworks and policies,
including but not limited to, our “Speak Up” Policy and the Code of Conduct.

**_ESG Committee_**

Our Chief Operations and Product Officer, who is an executive committee member, has the ultimate
responsibility for determining our ESG strategy, and the Chief Sustainability Officer is accountable for its development.
The Chief Operations and Product Officer, supported by the Chief Sustainability Officer, chairs a cross-functional ESG
leadership team, which is responsible for the implementation, progress monitoring and management of material ESG risks
and opportunities, supported by a central team of ESG experts.

**_Information Security Committee_**

Our Information Security Committee is led by the Chief Information Security Officer and monitors the Group’s
information security, which includes overseeing the Group’s technology and information systems, including with respect
to strategies, objectives, capabilities, identifying threats, protection initiatives, compliance, policies and investments.

**_Remuneration Committee_**

Our Remuneration Committee is responsible for establishing and reviewing the remuneration policy to ensure
that the policy provides a clear link between our business strategy and performance and shareholders’ interests. Our
remuneration policy is based on principles of pay for performance and market competitive pay. The key elements of our
remuneration package are fixed pay, annual bonuses, long-term incentives and inclusive care-focused benefits. Although
we follow these four key elements while structuring the remuneration package, each remuneration package is tailored by
using country-specific market date to ensure fair and competitive packages in all our locations. As such, bonus targets
and benefits are benchmarked against the external market in each country.

**Director and Executive Officer Compensation**

**_Compensation Paid_**

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the aggregate compensation recorded in respect of members of the
executive committee was €25 million, consisting of salaries and other short-term employee benefits, post-employment
benefits, termination benefits and share-based payments.

**_Equity-based Incentive Plans_**

Certain Group senior executives and management members are entitled to participate in management incentive
plans, whereby they are entitled to receive equity interests in certain parent entities of the Company, as described below.

_Senior Executive Equity Plan_

We have established a senior executive incentive plan (“Senior Executive Plan”) for senior executives to invest
their own funds to acquire class A and class C ordinary shares in Sigma Topco B.V., an intermediate parent of the
Company (“Sigma Topco”). In certain cases, loans are provided to senior executives for the sole purpose of acquiring
additional ordinary shares in Sigma Topco. Under the Senior Executive Plan, class A shares vest 2.083% on a monthly
basis from the date of issue/acquisition, such that the class A shares shall be vested on the fourth anniversary of the date
of issue/acquisition of the class A shares. Class A shares also vest in full upon the occurrence of a change in control event.
Under the Senior Executive Plan, class C shares will vest in full upon the occurrence of a change in control event.

_Management Equity Plan_

We implemented a management equity plan (“MEP”), which is a share-based incentive scheme offering senior
management the opportunity to invest in the Group. The MEP is for senior management to invest their own funds to
acquire class A1 and class A2 ordinary and preference depositary receipts in Sigma Interco B.V., an intermediate parent
of the Company, through one or more management vehicles (“Sigma Interco”). In certain cases, loans are also provided
to some of the individuals for the sole purpose of acquiring additional depositary receipts in Sigma Interco from the
management vehicles. The ordinary and preference depositary receipts vest 20% per year such that ownership shall be

115


-----

vested in full on the fifth anniversary of the relevant member of senior management’s ownership or in full upon the
occurrence of a change in control event.

In consideration for joining the MEP, the managers accepted certain customary “good,” “intermediate” and
“bad” leaver and restrictive covenant provisions. If a manager becomes a “leaver”, at any time within 12 months following
the date thereof, Sigma Interco can require such manager to transfer certain (and up to 100% where applicable) of their
depositary receipts back to a designee of Sigma Interco. In addition, managers can only transfer their depositary receipts
to an unconnected third party with KKR’s authorization, or pursuant to a drag or tag along right.

116

**PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER**

Entities advised by affiliates of Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”) indirectly hold 100% of the
shareholding of the Issuer.

The margin on any loans under an Additional Facility will be agreed between the Company and the relevant
lenders.

If EURIBOR, WIBOR or the relevant Base Rate (as applicable) is less than zero, EURIBOR, WIBOR or the
relevant Base Rate (as applicable) shall be deemed to be zero in respect of any loan under the Senior Credit Facilities.

Commitment fees are payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of Revolving Credit Facility 2
for the relevant periods set out in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement at a rate of 30% of the Margin of Revolving
Credit Facility 2 (the “RCF Commitment Fee”). Generally, the RCF Commitment Fee is payable quarterly in arrears,
on the last day of availability of Revolving Credit Facility 2 and if cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the relevant
lender’s commitment under Revolving Credit Facility 2 at the time such cancellation is effective.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on the overdue amount.

The Company is also required to pay (or procure the payment of) customary agency and arrangement fees in
connection with the Senior Credit Facilities.

**_Repayments_**

In relation to Senior Term Facility B7 only, 0.25% of the original principal amount of each Senior Term Facility
B7 loan made must be repaid quarterly. All other outstanding amounts under the Senior Term Facilities are required to
be repaid on the applicable maturity date for such Senior Term Facility.

Loans under Revolving Credit Facility 2 must be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto,
subject to a netting mechanism against new loans under Revolving Credit Facility 2 to be drawn on such date.

The termination date in respect of an Additional Facility will be the date agreed between the Company and the
relevant lenders.

**_Prepayment_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum amount and
certain conditions).

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment of all
amounts due to that lender upon a change of control of the Company or a sale of the whole or substantially the whole of
the business and assets of the Group.

In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires that, in respect of each financial year of the
Company, a mandatory prepayment of loans under the Senior Term Facilities is made in an amount equal to a percentage
of excess cashflow (net of a minimum threshold amount and the amount of any voluntary prepayments made during such
financial year) which percentage decreases as the Group’s Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined below) decreases.

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains a prepayment fee provision whereby lenders in respect of the
Senior Term Facilities will, subject to customary carve-outs and exceptions, benefit from a prepayment fee of 1% of their
participation in the relevant amount of any Senior Term Facility if all or part of that Senior Term Facility is voluntarily
prepaid in connection with a refinancing or repricing, or the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement is amended pursuant to a

121


-----

refinancing or repricing transaction, in each case, within six months of the 2023 Second Amendment Date (being January
31, 2024), the primary purpose of which is to reduce the effective yield on that Senior Term Facility.

**_Guarantees_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement is guaranteed by the Issuer and the Guarantors that also guarantee the
Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles as set
out in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Agreed Security Principles”)) each member of the Group which:

(a) is incorporated in the Netherlands, Germany, New York, Delaware and England (each a “Security
**Jurisdiction,” together, the “Security Jurisdictions”); and**

(b) is a “Material Subsidiary” (which is generally defined under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
to include, among other things, any member of the Group that has earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization representing 5% or more of consolidated EBITDA of the Group),

will be required to become a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement within 60 days of the delivery of the
Group’s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the relevant year showing that such subsidiary is a Material
Company such that the guarantors represent at least 80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group (excluding the
EBITDA of any member of the Group not required to become a Guarantor in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles).

In addition, any member of the Target Group which is incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction and is a Material
Company (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) is required to become a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement within 120 days of first utilization of the Senior Credit Facilities such that the guarantors represent at least
80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group (excluding the EBITDA of any member of the Group not required
to become a Guarantor in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles).

No member of the Group incorporated in Asia, South America, Africa or Russia shall be required to provide any
guarantee or security interests.

**_Security_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles,
the Permitted Collateral Liens and certain perfection requirements, the Initial Collateral and the Additional Collateral that
will secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties (subject to
certain exceptions and qualifications and with certain representations and warranties being repeated), including status and
incorporation, power and authority, binding obligations, non-conflict with constitutional documents, applicable laws and
certain other obligations, consents and filings, litigation, labour disputes, no default, accounts, environmental warranties,
intellectual properly, assets, applicable laws, taxation, information, pari passu ranking, security interests, guarantees and

(a) merge with other companies;

(b) incur additional indebtedness;

(c) enter into transactions other than on arm’s length basis;

(d) make restricted payments;

(e) create security over its assets;

122


-----

such sales);

(g) engage in business which is not a similar line of business; and

(h) repay or redeem any Permitted Senior Parent Debt or Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt (such

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires certain members of the Group to observe certain affirmative
covenants, including:

(a) maintenance of relevant authorizations and consents;

(b) compliance with laws;

(c) payment of taxes;

(d) maintenance of pari passu ranking of the Senior Credit Facilities;

(e) compliance with obligations relating to pensions;

records to the facility agent and the security agent;

(g) maintenance of intellectual property;

(h) maintenance of insurance; and

(i) maintenance of guarantor and security coverage and further assurances.

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement also contains an “information covenant” under which, among other
things and in the first instance, the Company is required to deliver to the Senior Facility Agent annual financial statements,
quarterly financial statements and compliance certificates. Note, however, that the delivery of accounts/financial
statements as set out under the caption “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports” of this
Offering Memorandum will satisfy the information covenant.

**_Financial Covenant_**

With respect to Revolving Credit Facility 2 only, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires that the sum
of certain outstanding senior secured net indebtedness of the Group to the consolidated EBITDA of the Group as at the
last day of each relevant period (the “Senior Secured Leverage Ratio”) shall not be greater than 8.50:1.00.

_provided that:_

(a) this financial covenant is only to be tested if on the last day of the applicable relevant period, the amount
drawn by way of loan under Revolving Credit Facility 2 is equal to or greater than 40% of Revolving
Credit Facility 2; and

(b) with respect to the Senior Term Facilities, failure to satisfy the financial covenant ratio shall not (or be
deemed to) constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or an event of
default.

The Company is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the net leverage covenant by applying a “cure” amount
(generally, amounts received by the Company in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted subordinated debt) as if
consolidated EBITDA had been increased by such amount. There is no requirement to apply any cure amount in
prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities. No more than two different cure amounts may be taken into account in any
financial year and no more than five different cure amounts may be taken into account prior to the original termination
date of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains certain events of default, the occurrence of which would allow
the requisite majority of lenders (under and as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) to, amongst other actions,

123


-----

accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments, including, among other events (subject in certain cases
to agreed grace periods, financial thresholds and other qualifications):

    - failure to pay off any amounts when due under the finance documents entered into in connection with the
Senior Credit Facilities;

    - (with respect to Revolving Credit Facility 2 only) breach of the financial covenant or (with respect to all
Senior Credit Facilities) failure to comply with other obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities finance

into in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities; and

    - breach of material obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement by any holding company of the Company.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

**The Senior Notes**

**_Overview_**

On May 9, 2018, the Company issued $525,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due
2026 (the “Senior Dollar Notes”) and €685,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Senior Notes due 2026
(the “Senior Euro Notes” and together with the Senior Dollar Notes, the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes were issued
under an indenture dated as of May 9, 2018 by and among, inter alios, the Company, as the issuer of the Senior Notes,
and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited as trustee, as amended and/or supplemented from time to time including by
supplemental indenture dated October 26, 2018 (the “Senior Notes Indenture”). As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, $487,400,000 aggregate principal amount of Senior Dollar Notes and €677,060,000 aggregate principal
amount of Senior Euro Notes is outstanding.

On or about the Issue Date, we intend to utilize the gross proceeds from the Offering to redeem (i) $180,760,000
in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Dollar Notes and (ii) €232,575,000 in aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Euro Notes, in each case, at par. Following the completion of such redemption, $306,640,000 in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Dollar Notes and €444,485,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Euro Notes, shall remain
outstanding.

**_Interest Rates, Payment Dates, Maturity and Redemption_**

The Senior Dollar Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.875% per annum. The Senior Euro Notes bear interest at a
rate of 5.750% per annum. Interest on either series of the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each May
15 and November 15 of each year. The Senior Notes will mature on May 15, 2026.

At any time and from time to time, the Company, prior to maturity, may redeem either series of Senior Notes in
whole or in part upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price of 100.000% of the
aggregate principal amount outstanding at such time.

**_Guarantees_**

The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than the
Company) (the “Senior Notes Guarantees”). Each such Senior Notes Guarantee is subordinated in right of payment to
all existing and future senior debt of each such Guarantor, including any obligation owed by the relevant Guarantor under
the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or certain hedging agreements.

124


-----

Additionally the Senior Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor is pari passu in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness of that Guarantor.

**_Security_**

The Senior Notes are secured on a senior subordinated basis by liens and security interests, over the shares of
Upfield Group B.V. (formerly Sigma Midco B.V.) and the receivables owing to the Company under the intercompany
loan agreement, pursuant to which the Company lent to Upfield Group B.V, a portion of the proceeds from the Senior
Notes (the “Shared Collateral,” which also forms part of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the
liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement).

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Notes Indenture contains covenants, that, among other things, limit the Company’s ability and the
ability of its subsidiaries to:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

    - layer debt;

    - make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions;

    - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

    - make certain investments;

    - create or permit to exist certain liens;

    - transfer, lease or sell certain assets;

    - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

    - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis;

    - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes; and

    - amend certain documents.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Notes Indenture contains customary events of default, including, among others, the non-payment of
principal or interest on the Senior Notes, certain failures to perform or observe any other obligation under the Senior
Notes Indenture, the failure to pay certain indebtedness or judgments and the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture). The occurrence of any of the events of default would permit or
require the acceleration of all obligations under the Senior Notes.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, Sigma Holdco B.V.
(the “Parent”), Upfield Group B.V., the Issuer and Upfield USA Corp (together with any other entity which accedes or
otherwise becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor, the “Debtors”) are parties to an intercreditor
agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) dated January 24, 2018, with, among others, Kroll Agency Services Limited
as facility agent and Credit Suisse International as security agent. The Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement
as a Senior Notes Trustee on the Issue Date.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out, among other things, the relative ranking
of certain indebtedness of the Debtors, the relative ranking of certain security granted by the collateral providers, when
payments can be made in respect of certain debt of the Debtors, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that

125

indebtedness, the terms pursuant to which certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events and turnover provisions.

the relevant limitations) as such guarantees and indemnities are provided by the obligors to the finance parties under the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Debt Refinancing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits any of the liabilities under the debt documents to be refinanced, replaced,
increased or otherwise restructured in whole or in part including by way of Permitted Senior Financing Debt, Second Lien
Debt, Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt or the issue of additional Senior
Notes and the introduction of a “super senior” credit facility (the “Priority Facility”) or the establishment of new or
additional Operating Facilities (each a “Debt Refinancing”).

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or replacement of
the then current Secured Debt Documents and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent in order to facilitate
such a Debt Refinancing including changes to, the taking of, or release and retake of any guarantee or security, subject to
certain conditions. At the option of the Parent, a Debt Refinancing may be made available on a basis which is senior to,
_pari passu with or junior to any of the other liabilities, shall be entitled to benefit from all or any of the security, may be_
made available on a secured or unsecured basis (subject to certain restrictions) and may be effected in whole or in part by
way of a debt exchange, non-cash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction, in each case unless otherwise
prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement each agent, each Secured Party and each Primary Creditor agrees
that it shall co-operate with the Parent, each other member of the Group and each agent in order to facilitate any Debt
Refinancing (including by way of, at the request and cost of the Parent, executing any document or agreement and/or
giving instructions to any person).

refinancing or replacement indebtedness from time to time), the Parent shall be entitled to require that the definition of
Instructing Group is amended such that the relevant refinancing or replacement indebtedness is treated in the same manner

shall be entitled to require that all or any part of the liabilities in relation to Hedging Liabilities and/or the Operating
Facility Liabilities shall rank in right and priority of payment pari passu with that Priority Facility (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may result in such Hedging Liabilities and/or, as the case may be, Operating Facility Liabilities
ranking ahead of the Senior Notes liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing liabilities, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities
and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities) in each case unless otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing
Agreements.

132


-----

Any Priority Facility implemented pursuant to a Debt Refinancing shall comply with, among others, the
following limitations:

_Ranking of a Priority Facility_

No liabilities or obligations in respect of any Priority Facility may rank in right and priority of payment ahead
of the Senior Lender Liabilities (other than amounts of the type set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) under the caption “—
_Application of Proceeds.”_

Subject to the paragraph above and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing Agreements,
any Priority Facility shall rank in right and priority of payment as determined by the Parent.

_Enforcement: Priority Facility_

The right of the lenders or other creditors in respect of a Priority Facility to:

(a) instruct the Security Agent to enforce the security;

(b) give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
security as they see fit; and/or

(c) otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group,

shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other Secured Parties than, those
customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Facility (if any), in each case as at the date such Priority Facility
is contractually committed by the relevant member(s) of the Group and as determined by the Parent (with any such
determination to be conclusive).

_Option to Purchase_

(a) The Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided with an
‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility consistent in all
material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation to the Senior Lender Liabilities
as set out under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities—Option to Purchase:
_Senior Secured Creditors.”_

(b) The Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative(s) shall be provided
with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility consistent
in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right as set out under the paragraph captioned “—
_Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities—Option to Purchase:_
_Senior Parent Creditors.”_

_Supplemental Security_

Without prejudice to the provisions set out under the caption “—Ranking and Priority” and “—Application of
_Proceeds” and the other rights of the Debtors under the Intercreditor Agreement and the debt documents, if any member_
of the Group enters into any hedging agreement or Operating Facility Document at any time after the date of the
Intercreditor Agreement (which is not already secured by the Original Transaction Security), any Debtor may, subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, at any time grant to the relevant Hedge Counterparty or, as the case may be,
Operating Facility Lender Supplemental Security securing all or any Hedging Liabilities arising under the relevant
hedging agreement or, as the case may be, all or any Operating Facility Liabilities arising under the relevant Operating
Facility Document. A Debtor may grant Supplemental Security to any secured creditor in connection with all or any part
of any New Debt Financing.

The Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries agree that Supplemental Security may be granted by
any Debtor in order to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities, any Operating Facility Liabilities and/or any New
Debt Financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set out this caption shall:

133


-----

(a) restrict the rights of the Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries to enforce and/or to
release all or any part of the Relevant Original Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents; or

(b) restrict, limit or prejudice the rights and other benefits of the Debtors or any member of the Group under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

Each of the Secured Parties agrees not to take any action to challenge the validity or enforceability of the
Supplemental Security by reason of it being expressed to be second ranking (or any other lower ranking).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Senior Parent Liabilities and Security” below, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Debtors (other than any Senior Parent Debt Issuer to the
extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior
Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or the borrower) to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank in
right and priority of payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as
follows:

(a) _first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing_
Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender
Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities, the Senior Arranger Liabilities, the Second
Lien Arranger Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee, the
Second Lien Agent Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee _pari passu and_
without any preference amongst them; and

(b) _second, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari passu_
and without any preference amongst them,

The liabilities owed by any Senior Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior
Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or the borrower)
to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank pari passu in right and priority of payment without
any preference amongst them.

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security shall secure the liabilities (but only to the extent that such
security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

(a) _first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing_
Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Senior Arranger Liabilities,
the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent Liabilities
and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee pari passu and without any preference amongst
them;

(b) _second, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and the_
Second Lien Arranger Liabilities pari passu and without any preference amongst them; and

(c) _third, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari passu and_
without any preference amongst them.

_Senior Parent Liabilities and Security_

The Senior Parent Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities owed by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer
(to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that
Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower) are senior obligations of that Senior Parent
Debt Issuer. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Senior Parent Notes Creditors and the Permitted Parent
Financing Creditors agree that, until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, they may not take any steps subject to the
Security Documents in connection with any Enforcement Action, other than as expressly permitted by the Intercreditor
Agreement.

134


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set out in the preceding paragraph shall not impair the right of the
Senior Parent Creditors and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors to institute suit for the recovery of any payment
due by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer in respect of the Senior Parent Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent Financing
Liabilities (in each case to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent
Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower).

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-Group liabilities and the liabilities of the Group to an investor
are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility
Lenders, but does not purport to rank any of those liabilities as between themselves.

_Additional and/or Refinancing Debt_

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders acknowledge in the Intercreditor Agreement that the Debtors
(or any of them) may wish to incur incremental borrowing liabilities (including guarantees of such liabilities) or refinance
or replace borrowing liabilities (including incurring guarantee liabilities in respect of such refinancing or replacement).
Such liabilities are intended to rank pari passu with any other liabilities and/or share pari passu in any security and/or to
rank behind any other liabilities and/or to share in any security behind any such other liabilities.

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders undertake in the Intercreditor Agreement (at the cost of the
Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and facilitating such financing, refinancing
or replacement and such sharing in the security (provided it is not prohibited by the terms of the Debt Financing
Agreements at such time) to take place in a timely manner. In particular, but without limitation, each of the secured parties
authorizes and directs each of its respective agents and the Security Agent to execute any amendment to or replacement
of the Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt documents and/or (subject to certain pre-conditions) release and retake
of security required by the Parent to reflect, enable and/or facilitate any such arrangements (including, as regards the
ranking of any such arrangements).

If a Debtor incurs any new, additional or increased liabilities under any Secured Debt Document and/or in
connection with any Debt Refinancing, at the option of the Parent, the relevant Debtor may (but subject to the relevant
Debt Financing being elected to be secured in accordance with the applicable terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
subject to the agreed security principles) grant to the relevant Secured Parties in respect of all or any part of such Debt
Financing additional security by executing additional security documents which will benefit from the order of priority
and ranking set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities at any time.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Creditors, the Operating Facility Lenders, the
Parent and the Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the finance documents in relation to the Senior
Facilities (the “Senior Facilities Finance Documents”), the Senior Notes, the Permitted Senior Financing Debt, the
Second Lien Facility (the “Second Lien Facility Finance Documents”), the Permitted Second Lien Financing
Documents and/or any Operating Facility in accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and subject only
to any consent required under them).

_Security and Guarantees: Senior Secured Creditors_

The Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders may take, accept or receive the benefit of:

(a) any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Liabilities in addition to the
shared security provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain agreed security
principles:

(i) the security provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not already
a party in that capacity);

(ii) all amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender with respect to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security
Agent and applied in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application
_of Proceeds”; and_

135


-----

(iii) any such security may only be enforced in accordance with the provisions set out under the
caption “—Enforcement of Security—Security Held by Other Creditors.”

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group regarding any
of the Senior Liabilities in addition to those in:

(i) the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior
Financing Document, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, any Permitted Second Lien
Financing Document or any Operating Facility Document;

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the liabilities, the
benefit of which (however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain
agreed security principles, given to, or expressed to be given to, all the senior secured parties
in respect of their senior secured liabilities, provided that (except for any guarantee, indemnity
or other assurance against loss permitted to be given to any ancillary lender or issuing bank),
to the extent legally possible, and subject to certain agreed security principles,

(A) the guarantee provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if
not already a party in that capacity); and

(B) such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in
connection with:

(i) any escrow or similar or equivalent arrangements entered into in respect of amounts which are
being held (or will be held) by a person which is not a member of the Group prior to release
of those amounts to a member of the Group; or

(ii) any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other
discharge of any Senior Lender Liabilities, Operating Facility Liabilities, Senior Notes
liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities and/or Second Lien Liabilities (in each case
provided that such defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other
discharge is not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

All amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender with
respect to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security Agent and applied in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds.”

Any such Security may only be enforced in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement which
relate to security held by someone other than the Security Agent.

Any such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders, Operating Facility Lenders, Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that no Senior Lender, Operating Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor
or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor may take certain Enforcement Action without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group (as defined below).

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement, after the
occurrence of certain specified insolvency events (an “Insolvency Event”) in relation to the Parent or a Debtor, each
Senior Lender, Operating Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor and/or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor may, to the
extent it is permitted to do so under the relevant Debt Documents, take certain Enforcement Action and/or claim in the
winding up, dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event or process in relation to that Debtor
for liabilities owing to it (but no Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may direct the Security Agent to
enforce the common security in any manner).

Senior Notes Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities (the “Senior Secured
**Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration event which is continuing, by giving not less than**
ten (10) days’ notice to the Security Agent (with the first notice to prevail in the event that more than one set of Creditors
serves such a notice), require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees), in accordance with the applicable transfer

set out in the paragraph captioned “—Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors” or having exercised
such rights, have not failed to complete the acquisition of the relevant Senior Secured Liabilities in

Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, no Senior Liabilities Transfer may be required to be made.

-----

(d) of any costs and expenses of any holder of security in relation to protection, preservation or enforcement
of such security;

(e) of costs, commissions, taxes, fees and expenses incurred in respect of or in relation to (or reasonably
incidental to) any of the Second Lien Debt Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing

Debt, Permitted Parent Financing Debt and/or the proceeds of any indebtedness incurred under or
pursuant to any Second Lien Debt Document and/or Senior Parent Notes;

(g) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of an Equity Contribution or Available
Shareholder Amounts; or

(h) of any other amount not exceeding €5,000,000 (or its equivalent) in aggregate in any financial year of
the Parent.

On or after the Senior Discharge Date, the Debtors may make payments to the Second Lien Creditors in respect
of the Second Lien liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Second Lien Finance Documents, as applicable.

**_Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, no Debtor shall make (and the Parent
shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and no Second Lien Secured Creditor may receive from any
other member of the Group, any Permitted Second Lien Payment (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, a roll-up or
capitalization of any amount and Second Lien Agent Liabilities, and payments permitted under (b) to (f) under the caption
“—Permitted Second Lien Liabilities Payments”) if:

(a) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) an insolvency event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture
and/or any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement and/or a breach of the revolving facility financial
maintenance covenant under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (a “Material Event of Default”)
is continuing, from the date which is one Business Day after the date on which any Senior Agent delivers
a notice (a “Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to
that Material Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Senior Parent Agents until the
earliest of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of Second Lien Liabilities, if a Second Lien Standstill Period is in
effect at any time after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, the date on which
that Second Lien Standstill Period expires;

(iii) the date on which the relevant Material Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Second Lien Agents
cancelling the Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(v) the Senior Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent or a Second Lien Agent takes Enforcement Action
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless each of the Second Lien Agents waives this requirement: (a) a new Second Lien Payment Stop Notice
may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice; and (b) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a
Material Event of Default more than 75 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Material Event of
Default.

140


-----

The Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Agents to issue a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances. No Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice may be served by an Agent in respect of a Material Event of Default which had been notified to the Agents at the
time at which an earlier Second Lien Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Second Lien Debt Documents as a result of the issue of a Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent: (a) the occurrence of an Event
of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Second Lien Debt Document; or (b) the issue of a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on behalf of
the Second Lien Secured Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall
continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Debt Document by the operation of the provisions set out under each section
above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Secured Creditors and Second Lien Liabilities” even if
its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If:

(a) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or, as the case
may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Secured Creditors an amount equal to any Payments
which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents and which would have been Permitted
Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other Debt Document) which may
have occurred as a result of that suspension of Payments shall be waived and any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which
may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being
required on the part of the Second Lien Secured Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group:

(a) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the
enforcement of any security; and/or

(b) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation
to the Second Lien Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” below,
provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to the extent the Security
Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

**_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_**

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors,”
the restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien
_Secured Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(a) an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement, a “Second Lien Event of
**Default”) (the “Relevant Second Lien Default”) is continuing;**

141


-----

(b) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Second Lien Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien Default from the relevant Second Lien Agent;

(c) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(d) the Relevant Second Lien Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Second Lien Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Second Lien Event of Default, the relevant Second Lien Agent may by
notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such Second Lien
Event of Default.

_Second Lien Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning
on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent serves a Second Lien Enforcement
Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Second Lien Event of Default and ending on the earlier to occur
of:

(a) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date

(b) the date the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) take any
Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor,
provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the Second
Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the relevant Second
Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured
Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) against such Second Lien Borrower or Second
Lien Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or a particular Second
Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first-mentioned
Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior Noteholders) and
any Senior Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors) has been obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Facility or on any Permitted
Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding
on that Second Lien Facility or on that Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be
(provided that, unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the
Majority Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the
date falling 85 months after the date of the first utilization under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement).

_Subsequent Second Lien Facility Defaults_

The Second Lien Secured Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in caption “—
_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if, at the end of any relevant_
Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien Standstill Period has begun as a result of any
other Second Lien Event of Default.

_Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Agents that it is enforcing Security created pursuant to any
Security Document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Second Lien Secured Creditor
may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement”
against that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor (or any Subsidiary of that Second Lien Borrower or Second
Lien Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in accordance with the instructions of

142


-----

an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of
proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Second Lien Agent(s) (on behalf of the Second Lien Secured
Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes
Indenture or in relation to any Permitted Senior Financing Debt which is continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’
notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the Second Lien Secured Creditors (or to a nominee or nominees) of
all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes
Liabilities, any Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(a) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes
Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes
Liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted
Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility
Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities);

(b) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (in the
case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior
Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing
Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding
(in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents
pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the
Operating Facility Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than as specified in the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the applicable Senior Notes Trustee
(on behalf of the relevant Senior Noteholders), the applicable Senior Creditor Representative (on behalf
of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) and the Operating Facility Lenders is paid the
amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(d) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to
the Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(e) an indemnity is provided from each Second Lien Secured Creditor (other than any Second Lien Agent)
(or from another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the
Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders) in a form reasonably
satisfactory to each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor and
Operating Facility Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained
or incurred by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or recovered by any Senior Lender,
Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender from any
person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from
any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender for any reason; and

(f) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders, the
Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or the Operating Facility Lenders,
except that each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor and
Operating Facility Lender shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer
that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorise
the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien
Secured Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer
of hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

143


-----

At the request of a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured Creditors), the Senior Facility
Agent, any relevant Senior Notes Trustee, any relevant Senior Creditor Representative and the Operating Facility Lenders
shall notify the Second Lien Agents of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such transfer.

other discharge is not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

**_Permitted Senior Parent Payments_**

Prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, any member of the Group may, directly or indirectly, make

**_Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, and until the Second Lien Discharge
Date, except with the Required Second Lien Consent, no Senior Parent Debt Issuer shall make (and the Parent shall
procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and neither the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, any holder of Senior
Parent Notes or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors may receive from any other members of the Group, any
Permitted Senior Parent Payment (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, a roll-up or capitalization of any amount and
certain amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its own account, payments funded by amounts not received

on which any of the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor
Representative (together, the “Senior Agents”) delivers a payment stop notice (a “Senior Parent
**Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to that Senior Event of Default**
to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor

shall not prevent: (a) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Parent Financing Documents, as applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to
the relevant Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents; or (b) the issue of a Senior
Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the provisions set out under each section above under the
caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make
such payment is restricted at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any
Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Senior Parent Creditors_

If:

Senior Payment Default, that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding
and/or, as the case may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(b) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Senior
Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any Senior Parent
Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which would have been
Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt document) which may
have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and any Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which
may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default shall be waived, in each case without any further action being
required on the part of the Senior Parent Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

and other Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes finance documents and/or the Permitted
Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent
required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

any Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as the case may be);

(c) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(d) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent Standstill

under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above against that Senior Parent
Guarantor while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that security in accordance with the instructions of an
Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of
proceeds to be derived therefrom.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in
relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any member of the Group, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of the Group in respect of liabilities owed to that party
shall (in the case of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution would otherwise
constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set out below under the caption“—Turnover” and, in
all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing
Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the
extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Group to
pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this
respect, the Security Agent shall apply distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption
“—Application of Proceeds” below.

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are discharged by way of
set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the Group, any
Creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which benefited from that set-off shall (in the case of any Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a
type subject to the provisions set out below under the caption “—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event,
only if required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment
instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the
liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below and subject to certain exceptions.

150


-----

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below, if the Security Agent or
any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities
will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied
towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor (or, following an acceleration event which
is continuing, any member of the Group), each Creditor and each Operating Facility Lender irrevocably authorizes the
Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against that
member of the Group;

(b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the Group’s
liabilities; and

(d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably necessary
to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

Each Creditor and Operating Facility Lender will: (a) do all things that the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) reasonably requests in order to give effect to the matters referred to in this
“—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section; and (b) if the Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the
actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section or if the Security Agent (acting in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) requests that a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender take that
action, undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of attorney
to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement) may reasonably require, although neither the Senior Notes Trustee nor the Senior Parent Notes Trustee shall
be under any obligation to grant such powers of attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender receives or recovers from any member of the Group:

(a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is prohibited
under the Intercreditor Agreement or, following the occurrence of a Senior Distress Event which is
continuing, any Senior Lender Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Senior Notes liabilities, Permitted Senior
Financing liabilities or Operating Facility liabilities;

(b) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of
_Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which does not give_
effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) above, other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the
caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” any amount:

(i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress event
(including as a result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the Group other
than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Group); or

(ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a distress
event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below the
caption “—Application of Proceeds”;

(d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set out below
under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(e) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in
relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in accordance with the

151


-----

provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or
after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of Group,

that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender will, subject to certain exceptions: (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not
received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or
if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions
and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) subject to receiving payment instructions
and any other relevant information the Security Agent, promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which
the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off,
subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement Instructions_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the security unless instructed otherwise by: (a) an Instructing
Group; (b) if required as set out in the third paragraph of this section, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; or (c) if required
as set out under the fourth paragraph of this section, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors.

Subject to the security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms: (a) an Instructing Group; (b) to
the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the Senior Discharge Date as described
under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien Liabilities” above, the Majority Second Lien Creditors; or (c)
to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the security prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge
Date as described under the provisions under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior
_Parent Liabilities” above, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors, may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the_
Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date: (a) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce
or to cease enforcing the security; or (b) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an
Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Second Lien Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security
Agent as described under the provisions under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above.

Prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date: (a) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not
to enforce or to cease enforcing the security; or (b) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing Group, and, in each
case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect
to any instructions to enforce the security which the Majority Senior Parent Creditors are then entitled to give to the
Security Agent as described under the provisions under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above.

Subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, no secured party shall have any independent power
to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent in the manner contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement of Security— Enforcement
_Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of_
any administrator, examiner or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as:

(a) an Instructing Group;

(b) prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if: (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third paragraph under
the caption “—Enforcement of Security” above, given effect to instructions given by the Majority
Second Lien Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given instructions
as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Second Lien Creditors;

(c) prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, if: (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the fourth
paragraph under the caption “—Enforcement of Security” above, given effect to instructions given by

152


-----

the Majority Senior Parent Creditors to enforce the security; and (ii) an Instructing Group has not given
instructions as to the manner of enforcement of the security, the Majority Senior Parent Creditors,

shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (it being understood that, absent
such instructions, the Security Agent may elect to take no action).

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than the Senior Notes Trustee and the
Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each Operating Facility Lender shall agree with the Security Agent that it will cast its
vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of, any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any
insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by
the Security Agent. The Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an
Instructing Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to waive, reduce,
discharge, extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the liabilities owed to that Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement,
each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the security be enforced
in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by
virtue of the enforcement of any of the security or of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or
towards discharge of any of the secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security Agent, then that Creditor
or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in accordance with instructions given by an Instructing Group
pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be
construed as references to that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender).

**_Consultation Period_**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other Enforcement Action, the
creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented in the Instructing Group concerned
(and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each other creditor
representative, each other Hedge Counterparty, each Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent
in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period of not less than 10
business days (or, in the case of any consultation involving a Senior Notes Trustee, a Senior Parent
Notes Trustee or a Creditor Representative in respect of any high-yield notes, debt securities or other
similar instruments, 30 days) from the date on which details of the proposed instructions are received
by such creditor representative(s), Hedge Counterparties, Operating Facility Lenders and the Security
Agent (or such shorter period as each creditor representative, Hedge Counterparty, Operating Facility
Lender and the Security Agent shall agree) (the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry
of a Consultation Period shall the Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce the security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or take any other
Enforcement Action.

(b) No Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph (a) above
and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation Period (in each case
provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable requirements of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the Creditors represented in the
Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor representative, the
Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and thereby

153


-----

delay the commencement of enforcement of the security would reasonably be expected to have
a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security, and, where this paragraph
(b) applies:

any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Senior
Secured Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in relation to the matters
referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of any instructions from an Instructing Group to
enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the security or, as the case may be, take any other
Enforcement Action, the Security Agent shall provide a copy of such instructions to each Agent, Hedge
Counterparty and Operating Facility Lender (unless it received those instructions from that person).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors acknowledges that, in the
event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the security prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge
Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any receiver or delegate owed to the Senior Parent Creditors in respect of
the method, type and timing of that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that security
shall, subject to the section entitled Distressed Disposals below, be no different to or greater than the duty that is owed by
the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the
Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(a) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the subject of:

(i) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior
Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, the Second Lien Facility
Agreement, any Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes
Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing
**Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the Group, but without prejudice to any**
obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide replacement
security); or

(ii) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement pursuant
to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(b) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or other agreement
requested in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that
document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or take any action
in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any
Debt Financing Agreement);

(c) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member of the
Group which has ceased to be a Debtor (or will cease to be a Debtor simultaneously with such release);
and

(d) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the extent that
such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

154


-----

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding company of any
Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be a
member of the Group or a Debtor (including in connection with the resignation of that Debtor or the Debtor being
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall (at the
request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly release (or procure the release of) that Debtor and its
subsidiaries (and its and their assets) from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals” section, the Parent shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(a) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above, the relevant disposal or other
action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

(b) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (d) above, the relevant release is in accordance
with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without the need for
any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other
Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into and deliver such documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent
(acting reasonably) shall require to give effect to any release or other matter described above.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Parent in accordance with
the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and provided that the requested action is not expressly prohibited by
any of the other Debt Financing Agreements), the Security Agent and the other Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders
shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, the relevant Additional Security Provider and/or the Parent) promptly execute
any guarantee, security or other release and/or any amendment, supplement or other documentation relating to the Security
Documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and the Security Agent is authorized
to execute, and will promptly execute if requested by the Parent, without the need for any further consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, any such release or document on behalf
of the Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders). When making any request pursuant to this paragraph the Parent shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent that such request is in accordance with the terms of a Debt Financing Agreement
(and the requested action is not expressly prohibited by way of any of the other Debt Financing Agreements) and the
Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Debt Document, nothing in any Security Document shall operate
or be construed so as to prevent any transaction, matter or other step not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Debt Financing Agreements (a “Permitted Transaction”). The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and
the Secured Parties) hereby agrees (and is irrevocably authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation from any Party) that it shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent)
promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document
(or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any Security Document) as is requested by the Parent in order to
complete, implement or facilitate a Permitted Transaction. In the event that the Parent makes any request pursuant to and
in reliance on the preceding sentence, the Security Agent shall be permitted to request a confirmation from the Parent that
the relevant transaction, matter or other step is a Permitted Transaction and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on
that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the proceeds of
any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of the Senior Liabilities
then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or result in any breach of any
Senior Parent Finance Documents and such application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in
prepayment, redemption or other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without
prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in
prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent permitted or
contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at the cost
of the Parent):

(a) release the security; and

155


-----

(b) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities, undertakings
and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being effected
at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become enforceable in accordance
with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by enforcement of a security interest in accordance
with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or (c) being disposed of to a third party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably
authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor):

(a) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered
necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities,
its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor,
to release:

(i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(ii) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets; and

(iii) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(i) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated
as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or
Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document,
the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes
of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

156


-----

(ii) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of: all
(and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and Operating Facility
Lenders and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(i) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities
or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(ii) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor
of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those
intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving
Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities
are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor
liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption
“—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of constituted charged property), as if those proceeds
were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or
Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a
fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone
any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

Where Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those
Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities transferred to the Parent in which case the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other
Secured Party or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee
Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following two paragraphs, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at the
request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the consent of each Senior
Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal
are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a public auction in respect of which
the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered
an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial
point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the
liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall
have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any Second Lien
Liabilities will be released or disposed of, or any security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will be released, it is a
further condition to the release that either:

(a) each Second Lien Agent has approved the release; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor are sold:

157


-----

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(ii) all claims of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or
guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any) all of whose shares
(other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or disposed of
pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its
affiliates) and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or
disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with
such sale, provided that if each of the Senior Facility Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee and any
Senior Creditor Representative (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if any
such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its Affiliates and
not released and discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security Agent
shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its
affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to
participate; or

(B) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in
respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is
fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances,
including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial
adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it
being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or
engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured
and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the first date on which the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent
Financing Debt has occurred, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the guarantees of the Senior
Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any security over the assets of a Senior Parent
Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be released and/or the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted
Parent Financing Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

The Security Agent is authorized under the Intercreditor Agreement to hold any non-cash consideration received

If, for any reason, any Senior Creditor Liabilities, Senior Notes Liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities
or Operating Facility Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date and the resulting losses are not borne
by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the proportions which their respective
exposures at the relevant enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the relevant Senior Secured Creditors
and the Operating Facility Lenders at the enforcement date (or, in the case of Recoveries resulting from the realization or
enforcement of all or any part of the security or a transaction in lieu thereof, in a manner reflecting the order of priority
contemplated in under the section “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”), the relevant Senior Secured
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders will make such payments among themselves as the Security Agent shall
require to put the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in such a position that (after taking
into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the
order of priority contemplated under the section “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”).

**_Turnover of Enforcement Proceeds_**

If:

(a) the Security Agent or the relevant Agent is not entitled, for reasons of applicable law, to pay amounts
received pursuant to the making of a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against
loss or the enforcement of the security to the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility
Lenders but is entitled to distribute those amounts to Creditors (such Creditors, the “Receiving
**Creditors”) who, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, are subordinated in right**
and priority of payment to the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders; and

(b) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date has not yet occurred (nor would occur after taking into account
such payments), then the Receiving Creditors shall make such payments to the Senior Secured Creditors
and the Operating Facility Lenders as the Security Agent shall require to place the Senior Secured
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the position they would have been in had such amounts
been available for application against the Senior Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities,
provided this shall not apply to any receipt or recovery that has been distributed by:

(i) a Senior Notes Trustee to the Senior Noteholders in accordance with the Senior Notes Finance

(ii) a Senior Parent Notes Trustee to the Senior Parent Noteholders in accordance with the Senior
Parent Notes Finance Documents;

(iii) a Senior Creditor Representative to the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors in accordance

Creditor Representative or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as applicable) had received at least two Business
Days’ prior written notice (in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) that an acceleration event or an insolvency
event in relation to a Debtor had occurred or that the receipt or recovery falls within the provisions set out under the
caption “—Turnover” prior to distribution of the relevant amount.

**_Group Pushdown_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, generally, provides that on, in contemplation of, or after, a public equity offering
(an “IPO Event”) of any member of the Group (other than (x) a subsidiary of a borrower or issuer which is restricted
from being designated as such by the relevant Debt Financing Agreement and is not replaced prior to such a public equity
offering with another Group entity or (y) a subsidiary of the Parent) or any of its holding companies (the “IPO Entity”),
at the Parent’s option:

(a) the Group shall comprise only the IPO Entity and its restricted subsidiaries from time to time;

(b) the IPO Entity shall take on the Parent’s role under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(c) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings or other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
shall apply to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a Debtor or otherwise);

(d) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Debtor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result
in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term of the Intercreditor Agreement
or a default or an event of default;

(e) each holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents (including any security
granted by any such holding company; and

162


-----

(f) unless otherwise notified by the Parent:

(i) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor shall be irrevocably
and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement and all obligations and
restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Parent that
person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor and shall have no
further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor); and

(ii) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as an investor, such amendments being a “Group Pushdown.”

In the event that any person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an
investor as a consequence of the above paragraph, any term of any debt document which requires or assumes that any
person be an investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or
otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Parent must provide written notice to the Security Agent in order to implement a Group Pushdown. Such a
notice may be revoked prior to the IPO Event to which it relates provided that (where requested by an Instructing Group)
any security which was released is reinstated and any investor which was released from its obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement accedes again.

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or replacement of it
and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the
preceding paragraph and the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized to promptly execute any release or other document
and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject
to any security document) as is requested in order to complete, implement or facilitate such matters.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a security document may be
amended or waived only with the written consent of:

163


-----

(h) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging agreement, that Hedge
Counterparty (in each case only to the extent that the relevant amendment or waiver adversely affects

Lender under the applicable Operating Facility Document, as notified by the Parent to the Security
Agent at the time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(j) certain investors (as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement); and

Disposal (see “—Proceeds of Disposals—Non-Distressed Disposals”) or in connection with any other provision of any
Secured Debt Document (provided that such amendment or waiver is not expressly prohibited by the terms of any other
Secured Debt Document) shall be binding on all parties to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement or a security document may be amended by the Parent and the Security Agent
without the consent of any other party, to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes in each case of a minor
technical or administrative nature or as otherwise for the benefit of all or any of the Secured Parties. Any amendment,

Financing Agreements) may be approved with only the consent of the creditor representative in respect of that Debt
Financing Agreement and the Parent.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

The following is a description of the €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of        % Senior Secured
Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Secured Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by Upfield B.V., a private limited
liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands
(the “Issuer”), unconditionally guaranteed by Sigma Holdco B.V. (the “Company”) and certain subsidiaries of the
Company (together with the Company, the “Guarantors”). Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes,” the “Company” refers only to Sigma Holdco B.V. and any successor obligor to Sigma Holdco_
B.V. with respect to its Guarantee (the “Parent Guarantee”), and not to any of its subsidiaries, and the “Issuer” refers
only to Upfield B.V., and any successor obligor to Upfield B.V. with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, and not to any
of its subsidiaries.The proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used to (i)
redeem a portion of the outstanding amount of the Senior Dollar Notes (defined below) and (ii) redeem a portion of the
outstanding amount of the Senior Euro Notes (defined below), as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption
“Use of Proceeds.”

The Issuer will issue the Senior Secured Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue
Date among, inter alios, the Issuer, the Guarantors and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited (the “Trustee”). The Senior
Secured Notes will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the Senior Secured Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The
Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference to, or otherwise be subject to, the Trust
Indenture Act.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect
of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness,
turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security
Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and refers
to the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Security Documents (defined below) and does not purport to be complete
and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Security Documents, respectively. Because this description is a summary, it
may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Security Documents in their entirety. Copies of such documents are available
as described under “Where You Can Find Other Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this
description under “—Certain Definitions.”

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not subordinated in_
right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement;

    - effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured debt of the Issuer, or debt that is
secured on a basis junior to the Senior Secured Notes, including the guarantees of the Senior Notes, to the

and debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement;

166


-----

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Issuer that is secured by property or assets
that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing

Senior Secured Notes, including obligations to trade creditors; and

    - unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors as set forth under “—Guarantees.”

**_The Guarantees_**

The Guarantees will be:

    - senior obligations of the relevant Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - senior in right of payment to any Subordinated Indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor, including the
guarantees of the Senior Notes, other than the Guarantee by the Company;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with any senior debt of the relevant Guarantor that is not subordinated in_
right of payment to its Guarantee, including debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
(and with respect to the Company only, the Senior Notes);

    - effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured debt of the relevant Guarantor, or
debt that is secured on a basis junior to its Guarantee, including the guarantees of the Senior Notes, except
for the Guarantee by the Company, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt of the relevant Guarantor that is secured by property
or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such debt;

    - structurally subordinated to any existing or future debt of subsidiaries of the relevant Guarantor, other than
the Issuer, that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including obligations to trade creditors; and

    - subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, including the limitations described herein and in “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees_
_and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”_
and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations.”_

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue €400,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date.
The Senior Secured Notes will mature on       , 2029. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive payments on the Senior
Secured Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day (defined below) at the place at which such payment is due to
be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at
such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of        % per annum. Interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrear on         and         of each year, commencing
on       , 2024 to the holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment
date.

167


-----

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if
no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

If the interest payment date in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day, the Holder thereof
will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes**

From time to time, subject to compliance with the covenants described under the headings “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to_
issue additional Senior Secured Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Senior Secured Notes offered
hereby except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (defined below)
supplied to the Trustee (“Additional Senior Secured Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall
bear interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates
on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record
dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which
such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Senior
Secured Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Senior Secured Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Senior Secured Notes.

Such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated, along with all other Senior Secured Notes, as a single
class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to “Senior Secured Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Senior_
Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Senior Secured Notes. Additional Senior
Secured Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date,
but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to such initial Senior Secured Notes, and shall
be deemed to form one series and references to the Senior Secured Notes shall be deemed to include the Senior Secured
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well any such Additional Senior Secured Notes.

In the event that any Additional Senior Secured Notes sold pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act are not
fungible with any Senior Secured Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible
Additional Senior Secured Notes shall be issued with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities
identification number, as applicable, so that they are distinguishable from such previously issued Senior Secured Notes.
Additional Senior Secured Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act from time to time may be issued
with the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the initial Senior Secured Notes
previously issued without being fungible with the initial Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If
you are a U.S. holder (as defined in “Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”) considering
the purchase of Senior Secured Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S as part of this offering of Senior Secured Notes or in
the secondary market, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular U.S. federal income tax

168


-----

consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of such Senior Secured Notes, including with respect to
the potential issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes that are not fungible with the initial Senior Secured Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, but which are nevertheless not capable of being separately identified.

For purposes of voting (or any other matter requiring a determination based on percentage of principal amount
of Senior Secured Notes outstanding), the aggregate principal amount of any Senior Secured Notes not denominated in
euro will be calculated using the Euro Equivalent (defined below) of such aggregate principal amount outstanding as of
the relevant issuance date of such Senior Secured Notes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (defined below), if any, on the Global Notes
(defined below) will be payable through one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
Euroclear or Clearstream, which will credit the account specified by the Holder (being Euroclear or Clearstream or their
nominee).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
**Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents (defined below)**
maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid at the option of the
Issuer by check mailed or bank transfer to the address of the Holder as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered
Notes. See “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each a “Paying Agent”) for the Senior Secured Notes for
so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in registered form. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and (ii) one or more transfer agents
(each, a “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent
will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Paying Agent, Registrar and/or the Transfer Agent (together, the “Agents”),
as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time,
if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The
Transfer Agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes without
prior notice to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form
without interest coupons, as follows:

    - The Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

    - The 144A Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

    - The Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”).

    - The Regulation S Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of
interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification
requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of BookEntry Interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as

169


-----

applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under
the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a BookEntry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to
which it was transferred.

In the event Additional Senior Secured Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act that bear
the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as the initial Notes previously issued,
without being fungible with the initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation
S Global Notes (including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or
prior to the date of issuance of such Additional Senior Secured Notes) will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry
Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any). Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of BookEntry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes. See also “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form—Transfers.”

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000 in
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in each case upon receipt by the Registrar
of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is
expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from
the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a BookEntry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance with
applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate principal
amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture
will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to
furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such
transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes,
duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Senior
Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Senior Secured Notes
to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date applicable to
such Senior Secured Notes; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Senior Secured
Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the circumstances
described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Company will be permitted to designate
Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Indenture.

170


-----

**Guarantees**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Senior
Secured Notes, including any payment obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security
Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior secured basis, by the Guarantors. Each guarantee granted
under the Indenture by a Guarantor is referred to herein as a “Guarantee.” The initial Guarantors will be: the Company,
Upfield Group B.V., Upfield Holdings B.V., Upfield Nederland B.V., Upfield Research and Development B.V., Upfield
Europe B.V., Upfield NL Holdings Two B.V., Upfield Treasury B.V., Upfield Real Estate B.V., Upfield US Inc., Upfield
Sourcing US, Inc., Upfield USA Corp., Upfield UK Services Limited, Upfield Foods UK Limited, Upfield Spreads UK
Limited, Upfield Deutschland GmbH, Upfield Sourcing Deutschland GmbH & Co. OHG and Upfield Verwaltungs
GmbH.

The Guarantors that will grant the Guarantees are also borrowers or guarantors under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement. In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that guarantees
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured
Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Therefore the Senior Secured Notes will indirectly benefit from the
minimum guarantor provisions set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, as amended or restated from time to
time. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.”

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles
include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory limitations, regulatory requirements or restrictions, financial assistance laws, corporate benefit laws, liquidity
protection rules, fraudulent preference, “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” “thin capitalization” rules,
tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject
to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise required under the
Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the security interests_
_in the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior_
_Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to the_
_liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not_
_secure the Senior Secured Notes.”_

Under the Indenture, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

    - except for the Parent Guarantee, upon the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of ownership interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent
company) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or other disposition
of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary),
in each case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

    - except for the Parent Guarantee, upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance”
and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

    - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its
liability with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement;

    - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(defined below);

    - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

171


-----

    - with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation
or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants— Merger and Consolidation—
_Guarantors” and the Indenture;_

    - with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to which
substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor; or

    - in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt
of certain documents from the Company or the relevant Guarantor, will execute any documents delivered to it by the
Company or such relevant Guarantor in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Guarantee. None of the Company, the Issuer, the Trustee nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on
the Senior Secured Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination.

Substantially all the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of
non-guarantor Subsidiaries, other than the Issuer, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of
creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Guarantee therefore
will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any)
of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Company that are not the Issuer.

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented (on a
consolidated basis, after giving effect to intercompany eliminations and excluding goodwill, intangible assets,
investments, deferred taxes and inter-company assets, as applicable) 48.4% of our net sales, 68.7% of our Normalized
EBITDA and 51.7% of our total assets. Only certain Subsidiaries organized or incorporated in the Netherlands, Germany,
Delaware and England & Wales will guarantee the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Although the Indenture
limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence
by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under
the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles,
Permitted Collateral Liens and certain perfection requirements, on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis by English law and New York law governed security interests over
certain material assets of the Guarantors incorporated in England & Wales and Delaware, including (i) material operating
bank accounts of such Guarantors, (ii) material structural intercompany receivables owing to such Guarantors and (iii)
shares or capital stock (or partnership interests, as applicable) held in respect of such Guarantors, (collectively, the “Initial
**Collateral”).**

In addition, pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security
Principles, Permitted Collateral Liens and certain perfection requirements, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Issue Date and in any event within 10 days from the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be
secured on a subsequent-ranking basis (in each case treated as first ranking in accordance with the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement) by:

  - Dutch law governed security interests over certain (i) material operating bank accounts of the Issuer and the
Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands, (ii) material structural intercompany receivables owing to
Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands and (iii) shares or capital stock (or partnership interests, as
applicable) held in respect of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors incorporated in the Netherlands,

  - German law governed security interests over certain (i) material operating bank accounts of the Guarantors
incorporated in Germany and (ii) shares or capital stock (or partnership interests, as applicable) held in respect
of such Guarantors; and

172


-----

(collectively, the “ Additional Collateral,” together with the Initial Collateral, and any and all assets from time to
time in which a security interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document to secure the
obligations under the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes or any Guarantee, in each case, as may be in existence
from time to time, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and hedging agreements,
and may secure, from time to time, additional Indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral. Pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any
hedging obligations and certain future Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” and permitted to be secured on the Collateral (see “—Certain Definitions—Permitted_
_Collateral Liens”) will rank pari passu with the holders of the Senior Secured Notes with respect to any proceeds received_
upon any enforcement action over any Collateral, and the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, hedging obligations and such permitted or other future senior secured Indebtedness will receive
priority over the Senior Notes with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Shared
Collateral. See “—Priority.” Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the Issuer and the Guarantors are permitted to grant security over_
the Collateral in connection with future Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any
Additional Senior Secured Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any
proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral will be applied pro rata in payment of all liabilities in respect
of obligations under the Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement and hedging agreements and any other Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted
to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement on an equal ranking
basis with the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, with respect to the Senior Notes, the Company has granted in favor of the Security Agent, subject to
the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, Permitted Collateral Liens and certain perfection
requirements, liens and security interests on a senior subordinated basis, over the shares of Upfield Group B.V. (formerly
Sigma Midco B.V.) and the receivables owing to the Company under the intercompany loan agreement, pursuant to which
the Company lent to Upfield Group B.V, a portion of the proceeds from the Senior Notes (the “Shared Collateral,”
which also forms part of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes).

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due
to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has
not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to
the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands or the jurisdiction_
_of incorporation or formation of the Guarantors may not be as favorable to investors as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and_
_may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes from recovering payments due on the Senior Secured Notes.”_

In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable
amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Senior Secured Notes and a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could
be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the
_Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Collateral provider will
have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes
(other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of
any income therefrom.

173


-----

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in
connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of
the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the payment
of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations secured on a pari passu basis.
By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability of the
Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of
the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date will have, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note,
each Holder will be deemed to have:

    - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other
relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

    - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which
it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights,
power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

    - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement and other future indebtedness that is pari passu with the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, (b) the
counterparties under certain hedging agreements, (c) the trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes under the Senior
Notes Indenture and (d) the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture, is established by
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide that (i) the obligations under each
of the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations and
creditors under any future indebtedness that may be secured on a first-ranking basis in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will receive proceeds on enforcement of security over the Collateral equally
and ratably on a first priority basis and (ii) the obligations under the Senior Notes will receive proceeds on enforcement
of security over the Shared Collateral only after the senior secured obligations described under the previous item (i) are
satisfied. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be
pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”
and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, under certain circumstances, debt having priority over the Senior
Secured Notes may be put in place. The introduction of such priority debt would mean that the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes would rank behind other debt, including with respect to payments, ranking of security or the application
of proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the
_Guarantees and the Collateral—If a “Priority Facility” is introduced in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor_
_Agreement, creditors under such facility, counterparties to certain hedging obligations and creditors under certain_
_operating facilities could rank in priority over the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary, the Trustee will take any action required to effectuate
any release of Collateral required by a Security Document:

(1) upon payment in full of the principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes issued under the Indenture or satisfaction and discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance with
the Indenture;

174


-----

(2) upon release of a Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture, the release of the property and assets and
Capital Stock of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person
other than the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company and the Issuer”) if such sale or
other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture (with respect to_
the Lien on such Collateral) or (b) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in a manner consistent
with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, Public Debt or such other Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant
the Lien over such Collateral is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge thereof);
_provided that such release would otherwise be permitted by another clause above;_

(6) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection with a
solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of
such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(9) upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event as described under “—Certain Covenants—Suspension of
_Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status,” so long as no Indebtedness Incurred pursuant_
to a Credit Facility and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and guarantees
in respect of such Indebtedness Incurred, in each case, Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” is at
such time secured in a manner that would require the granting of a Lien pursuant to the covenant
described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens;”

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, including under the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”; and

(11) in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary, the Trustee
without the consent of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may also, among other things,
without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the
Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related
transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security Documents which has become worn out, defective or
obsolete or not used or useful in the business; (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets in the
ordinary course of business; and (iii) any other action permitted by the Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that
is permitted to share in the Collateral (and which the Company elects shall share in the Collateral), the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall, at the request of the Company, enter into with the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries
and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or more intercreditor agreements or
deeds (including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that
are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) and substantially similar as applies to sharing
of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security; provided that such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion

175


-----

of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or
immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with
the foregoing, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee such documentation in relation thereto as it may reasonably
require. As used herein, a reference to the Intercreditor Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to
the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described
herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Company and without the consent of holders
of the Senior Secured Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments
to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2)
increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such
Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5)
make provision to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens or to implement an IPO Pushdown in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of
Senior Secured Notes in any material respect.

The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted
by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Company may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter
into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or
immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into
in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement, any amendments referenced in the third paragraph of this covenant and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available to the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes upon request and will be made available for inspection during normal business hours
on any Business Day upon prior written request at the office of the Company.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event (as defined herein), the Company shall be entitled
to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that: (i)
references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to
the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; (ii) all financial ratio, basket
calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity (or the Company,
if so elected); (iii) each reference in the Indenture and/ or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Company” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown
Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise, and provided that nothing in
this clause (1), including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause (iii) and any action
taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Company, shall, or shall be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture
or a Default or an Event of Default); (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings,
covenants or Events of Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or the other Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO
Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event,
matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its

176


-----

capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default;
(vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any such Holding Company; (vii) unless
otherwise notified by the Company: (A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all
obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) (and from the date specified by the Company that person shall cease to be party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and shall have no
further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an Investor); and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to
become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor; and (viii) in the event that any person is released from or does not become party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor as a consequence
of this clause (1), any term of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any person be an Investor or that any liabilities
or obligations to such person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered
if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of
Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
provision).

(2) The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into any
amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the other Security Documents required by the Company and/or
take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters
contemplated by clause (1) above (the “IPO Pushdown”), including a supplemental indenture pursuant
to which (i) the IPO Pushdown Entity will assume all of the obligations of the Company under its
Guarantee, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that such amendment, replacement
or other document or instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent (as applicable), does not affect the rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent (as applicable) under
such Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement, Additional Intercreditor Agreement or Security Document.
The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and
instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such amended or
replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the
request of and at the cost of the Company).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company notified to the Trustee by the Company in writing as the Person to be treated as the IPO
Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event, provided that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be
a Restricted Subsidiary which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO
Event (or a Holding Company of such Person).

(4) If the Company delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and Security Agent pursuant to clause (1)
above in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at
any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee and Security
Agent. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this clause (4): (i) the
provisions of sub-clauses (1)(i) to (1)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown
Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to clause (1) above in reliance on that Pushdown
Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that
security; and (iii) if any Person party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an “Investor” has been released
from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to sub-clause (1)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown
Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as an
Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this clause (4) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the
Company from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO

177


-----

Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in
the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default
or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or any matter or
circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” the Senior Secured Notes are not redeemable at the option of the_
Issuer.

At any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the original aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Senior Secured Notes) during
each 12-month period commencing from the Issue Date, from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior written notice to the Holders as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal
to 103% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date.

In addition, at any time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole or in
part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders as described under the heading
“—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus
the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the
redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after       , 2026, the Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes
in whole or in part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice at a redemption price equal to
the applicable percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the
redemption date:

**Twelve month period commencing on** **in** **Percentage**

2026 .......................................................................................................................................................... %
2027 .......................................................................................................................................................... %
2028 and thereafter ................................................................................................................................... 100.0000%

At any time and from time to time prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, upon notice as described
under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” redeem the Senior Secured Notes, at its option, (i) with the net cash proceeds
received by the Issuer from any Equity Offering, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption
price equal to        %, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional
Senior Secured Notes), plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the redemption date, provided that in each
case (a) the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering and (b) not less
than 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes being redeemed (not including the principal amount
of any Additional Senior Secured Notes) remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

In addition, at any time following the occurrence of any Initial Public Offering, the Issuer may, at its option,
upon notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in
part, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of such Initial Public Offering received by
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (including without limitation, in the case of an Initial Public Offering by a
Parent Holding Entity, through the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, as a contribution to the common equity capital of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or as
a purchase of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary through an
issuance of Capital Stock by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary) at a redemption price equal to 102% of the
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to (but excluding) the redemption date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of Senior Secured
Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer, and the Issuer, or any third party making such
a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such
Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the

178


-----

Holders, given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder in such tender offer (other than
any incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to (but excluding) the redemption date. In determining whether the
Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of Senior Secured Notes have validly tendered
and not withdrawn Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Senior Secured Notes,
as applicable, Senior Secured Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate
of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other
offer, as applicable.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering or an Initial Public
Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering or Initial Public Offering). In addition, if such redemption or notice
is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been complied with
or satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have
been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs.

Notwithstanding anything else in the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes, redemption notices may be given
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is in connection with a defeasance of Senior Secured Notes or
a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Senior Secured Notes, it will, if and for so long as the Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), if and to the extent
the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require, inform the Authority of
such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes that will remain
outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured
Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

The Company, its direct and indirect equity holders, including the Initial Investors, any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Issuer) and their respective Affiliates and members of our management may trade in at any time and from
time to time the Senior Secured Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases
and sales, negotiated transactions or otherwise, and such purchases or sales may be at prices below par. The amounts
involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such transactions may be with
respect to a substantial amount of the Senior Secured Notes or another series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the
trading liquidity of such class or series in any purchase transactions.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as
applicable, will select the Senior Secured Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar, as applicable, by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or
if the Senior Secured Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Senior Secured
Notes are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a
pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor or by lot, as applicable; _provided,_ _however, that no Senior Secured Note of_
€100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral
multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made
by it in accordance with this paragraph.

179


-----

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the
extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer shall notify the Authority of such redemption and, in addition to
such publication, not less than 10 days nor, except in the case of a notice given in connection with a defeasance of Senior
Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, more than 60 days prior to the redemption, the Issuer will
mail, or at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be mailed or otherwise transmitted, such notice to Holders by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar; provided
that, for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, notices of redemption to Holders will be
delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream (and such delivery will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph),
each of which shall give notices to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior
Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original
Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Senior Secured
Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable
redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due
on the date fixed for redemption, or the redemption date as permitted to be delayed under the Indenture. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the
Issuer or a Guarantor determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would be, required
to pay any Additional Amounts with respect to such Senior Secured Notes, and such obligation cannot be avoided by
taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment
of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes); provided that neither the Issuer nor a Guarantor shall be required to take any
measures that in the Issuer’s good faith determination would result in the imposition on the Issuer or a Guarantor of any
legal or regulatory burden or the incurrence of additional costs, or would otherwise result in any adverse consequences to
the Issuer or a Guarantor. In the case of redemption as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after
the date of the Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that
becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must
become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax
Law would have applied to the predecessor of a Successor Issuer or the predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor. Notice
of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and
_Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the_
earliest date on which the Payor (defined below) would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a
payment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of any Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer or its successor, where applicable, will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer or Guarantor, or a successor
to either, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been complied with or satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent
tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable,
has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee

180


-----

and the Paying Agent will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the
conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer or Guarantor
is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through
which such successor makes any payment on the Senior Secured Notes or any Guarantees, or in each case, any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein having the power to tax.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees will
be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding
or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the Netherlands or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having power
to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Guarantee is made
by the Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a
resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Senior Secured Note or Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments by the Holders after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction
or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of
such payments on any such Senior Secured Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided,
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note (or between
a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant
Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, incorporated in or carrying
on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply, after reasonable notice, with any reasonable request of
the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, to provide certification, identification,
information, documentation or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or
connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make
any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any certification, identification, information, documentation
or other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, on the Senior Secured Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor
version), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered

181


-----

into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code and any intergovernmental agreements (and related
legislation or official administrative guidance) implemented with respect to the foregoing;

(6) any Taxes imposed or withheld in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who
would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Senior Secured Note to, or
otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent;

(7) any Taxes imposed or to be withheld in the Netherlands by the Issuer or Guarantor pursuant to the
Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021), as amended from time to time; or

(8) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Secured Note for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant payment was first made available for
payment to the beneficiary or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note been the Holder, such
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (8)
inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary
or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to the extent that a beneficiary or
settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Note
would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such
Senior Secured Note directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction; and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts
to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies
shall be made available to the Holders upon request.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any
payment made on any Senior Secured Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor
will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on
the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that
is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive
proof that such payments are necessary. The Trustee and each Paying Agent may rely on the fact that any Officer’s
Certificate contemplated by this paragraph has not been furnished as evidence of the fact that no withholding or deduction
for or on account of any Taxes imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction is required.

Wherever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or Guarantees,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent
that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other property or similar
Taxes (other than real property transfer taxes) that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration or enforcement of any Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document
or instrument in relation thereto (other than in connection with a transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes), and
the Issuer agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders. The foregoing obligations of this

182


-----

“Withholding Taxes” section will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis
_mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer or Guarantor is incorporated or organized or otherwise_
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor makes any payment
on any Senior Secured Note or Guarantee, or in each case, any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof
or therein having the power to tax.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer
to repurchase all (equal to €100,000 aggregate principal amount, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of
such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior to the
purchase date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Senior Secured Notes as described
under this “—Change of Control” section in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to
redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption
have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date
that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder
of any such Senior Secured Notes, by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with
a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive
interest on the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior to the purchase date) (the “Change
**of Control Payment”);**

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date
such notice is sent) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute
the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must
follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed or otherwise transmitted prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of
Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in
order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

183


-----

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail or otherwise
transmit to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior
Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Senior Secured Note equal in aggregate
principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such
new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change
of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the purchase date will be no earlier than 10 days from
the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is mailed or otherwise transmitted. If such Change of Control Offer is
subject to consummation of a Change of Control, such notice may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of
Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time as the Change of Control has been consummated, or such Change
of Control Payment may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Change of Control shall not
have been consummated; provided that in no case shall the Change of Control Offer have been delivered less than 10
days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which the Change of Control Payment occurs.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the
Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase
such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to
acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” expressly permits a third party to obtain control of the
Company in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of
Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Senior Secured Notes
validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third
party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer described above, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a
price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest on the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior
to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding have validly tendered and not withdrawn Senior Secured Notes in a Change of
Control Offer, Senior Secured Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate
of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of Change of Control Offer.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which any Senior Secured Notes are then listed) in
connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations, or require a repurchase of any Senior Secured Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture
by virtue of the conflict.

The occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment of borrowings under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement and may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes
Indenture. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Senior Secured Notes

184


-----

in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change
of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes
could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of the purchase on the Company or its Subsidiaries.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by the then existing financial resources of the Company and its Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not be able to finance_
_a change of control offer as required by the Indenture and certain transactions will not require us to make a change of_
_control offer.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case
law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all”
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a
majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture.

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness

of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would have
been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

185


-----

obligations under the Indenture, to the extent such subordination is required by the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a
Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, shall be deemed,
in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate
the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however,
with respect to each of clause (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction
(a) the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness does not exceed the greater of (i) €86 million and 10.0%
of Consolidated EBITDA at any time outstanding or (b) either (x) the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary would have been able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this
clause (5) or (y) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction;

million and 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described
in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify,
and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the
amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first
paragraph of this covenant;

(2) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),
(11), (15) or (19) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(6) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of an Applicable Test Date,
if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if
calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the Applicable Test Date of such
refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded
so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced; and

(7) the amount of Indebtedness shall be calculated as described under the definition of “Indebtedness.”

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the deemed repayment and redrawing
associated with the rollover of revolving or other credit facilities, payment of dividends in the form of additional shares

188


-----

of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness
due to a change in IFRS, including a change in IFRS or a change of IFRS to a different set of accounting principles, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Applicable Test Date; provided that (a)
if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums),
accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the
aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject
to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and
interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal
payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus
the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency
Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in
effect on the date of such refinancing.

into for bona fide commercial reasons); or (b) designate a Restricted Subsidiary which holds Material Intellectual Property
to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary, in each case, for the primary purpose of an Unrestricted Subsidiary raising Indebtedness

in each case as determined by the Company in good faith.

Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash

otherwise be included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or

Specified Change of Control Event, (2) the purpose of, or the effect of, the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property
or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Company so that there would
be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such
Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection
with such event in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits
therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property
or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted
Liens if the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, secured equally and ratably with (in the case of Liens with respect to Pari Passu
Indebtedness), or prior to (in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness) such Indebtedness for so long
as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (i) upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to
which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.
The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection
with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor to,
create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on

Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or the Company;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or the Company; or

or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any
standstill requirements to loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness
Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or
restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement), (b) the Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture or (c) any other agreement or instrument,

Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other
than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated
or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in
connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this
clause (2), if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in this second paragraph (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in this paragraph; provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such
refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the
Company), or that the Company determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such
encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to
make principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any

the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, together with the security documents
associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in
good faith by the Company) or where the Company determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that

way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date
of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to such Asset
Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash
Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is directly or indirectly
applied by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary): (i) to prepay, repay or
purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or the Issuer (in
each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) within
365 days from the later of: (A) the date of such Asset Disposition; and (B) the receipt of such
Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment
or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) (except
in the case of any revolving Indebtedness including, but not limited to, the revolving credit
facility made available under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) to be permanently
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; (ii) to
prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the
principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date
of such prepayment, repayment or purchase; provided that the Company shall redeem, repay
or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if
the Company either: (A) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this
clause (ii) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Senior Secured Notes as provided under “—Optional
_Redemption” and/or (y) purchasing Senior Secured Notes through open market purchases or_
in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par); and/or (B)
makes (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders
to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for
an Asset Disposition Offer on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Indebtedness
repaid pursuant to this clause (ii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer
for purposes hereof); (iii) to purchase Senior Secured Notes through open market purchases or
in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par); (iv) to make
(at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders to
purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for
purposes hereof); or (v) to redeem Senior Secured Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption”; or_

(b) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest
in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) or
otherwise in the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries within 365 days from
the later of: (i) the date of such Asset Disposition; and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash; _provided,_ _however, that any such investment made pursuant to a definitive binding_
agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Company that is
executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment
is consummated within twelve months of such 365th day; or

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of: (i) the date of such Asset
Disposition; and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such
capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company that is executed or approved
within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such capital expenditure is
consummated within twelve months of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or clause (b)_
above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net
Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

197


-----

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or
invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On
the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Company elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of €172 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA and has not been
committed in accordance with clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant (or if so committed, has not been
applied or invested in accordance with such commitment within the relevant period), the Company will be required to
make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Senior Secured Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the
extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition
Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, at an offer price of no more than) 100% of the
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each
case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants
contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal
amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Disposition
Offer Period (defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the
amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency
in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Company upon converting such
portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of
not less than five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the
Company will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the
extent they elect, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition
**Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured**
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, and, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five
Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Senior
Secured Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior
Secured Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s
Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior
Secured Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered;
_provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination_
of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Company to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

198


-----

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Company or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other
than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated NonCash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the
greater of €172 million and 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item
of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect
to subsequent changes in value).

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Senior Secured Notes are then listed)
in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service)
with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of €10 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for
such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of €86
million and 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b) of the second_
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted
Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent
Holding Company restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or

199


-----

arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto and any transaction
pursuant to or in connection with an MEP, incentive scheme, deferred compensation or similar
arrangement (including any MEP Payment);

(4) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary
of the Company or any Parent Holding Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through
any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to
or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date (or, in the
case of any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, any arrangements of that
Person in place at the date on which it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary), as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from
time to time, and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in
connection with any Public Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in
the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case
in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management of the Company or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably
have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any payments arising on the exercise of any put or call options (or any equivalent right or obligation)
in relation to any Associate or transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar
entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares)
of the Company or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial
terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the
Board of Directors of the Company; (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any
Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture; and (c)
directors’ qualifying shares and shares issued to foreign nationals as required by applicable law;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) hereof: (a) the payment of any
fees (including transaction fees and annual monitoring fees), out of pocket expenses and/or other
amounts as reflected in the original terms of each Service Agreement (including any such amounts
payment of which is deferred); (b) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any
Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Holding Company) of
fees and expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed in each fiscal year the greater of €19 million
and 2.2% of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters
ending prior to the date of such determination; and (c) payments by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent
Holding Company) for financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or
in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or
divestitures, which payments in respect of this clause (c) are approved by a majority of the Board of
Directors of the Company in good faith;

200


-----

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted
Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(13) any transaction effected pursuant to or in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(14) any transaction as to which the Company delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial
Advisor stating that the transaction is fair to the Company from a financial point of view, or meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following
reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue
Date, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the two most recent
fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance
sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision
of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year (and which have not already been the
subject of pro forma information provided by the Company); (c) an operating and financial review of
the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition,
and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies, with a similar scope to that included in the Offering
Memorandum; (d) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all
material affiliate transactions and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including
material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material risk factors and material recent
developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters of the Company, all quarterly reports
of the Company containing the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet of the Company as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and
cash flow of the Company for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited
condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period of the Company, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance
sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision
of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the relevant quarter (and which have not already been the subject of pro forma
information provided by the Company); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and
material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material changes
not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report;
and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any other material
event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a
description of such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in
effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that: (i) the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above
may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods; and (ii)
the Company may elect to prepare information on a basis consistent with the method of presentation for the financial
statements included in the Offering Memorandum so long as applicable. Except as provided for in this covenant, no report
need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company. The filing of an Annual Report on Form

201


-----

20-F within the time period specified in (1) will satisfy such provision. At the Company’s election it may also include
financial statements of a Parent Holding Company in lieu of those for the Company; _provided that, if the financial_
statements of a Parent Holding Company are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material
differences between the financial statements of the Parent Holding Company and the Company shall be included for any
period after the Issue Date. Following an IPO on the Capital Stock of the Company or any parent thereof and/or the listing
of such Capital Stock on a recognized European stock exchange, the requirements of this covenant shall be considered to
have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary
of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph
of this covenant shall include either: (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the
Company; or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, together with an unaudited
reconciliation to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the
following items: turnover, net sales, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders equity, capital
expenditures and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall also: (a) use its commercially
reasonable efforts: (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on such website as may be then maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries; or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as
determined by the Company in good faith); or (b) to the extent the Company determines in good faith that it cannot make
such reports or statement available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after
the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports or statement to the Holders and, upon request,
prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes. The Company will also make available copies of all reports required
by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed
on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require.

In addition, so long as the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the
Company shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed to comply with
any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default” until 180 days after the receipt of
the written notice delivered thereunder. To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified
in this section “—Reports” and such information is subsequently provided, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied
its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default or Event of Default with respect thereto shall be deemed
to have been cured.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for information
purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or notice of any information
contained therein or determination from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of
its covenants under the Indenture (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company and the Issuer_

Neither the Issuer nor the Company will consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United States of America,
any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway
or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer or the Company, as the case may be) will
expressly assume (subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles): (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes or the Company under the

202


-----

Parent Guarantee, as the case may be, and (b) all obligations of the Issuer or the Company, as the case
may be, under the Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) in the case of a transaction involving the Company, immediately after giving effect to such transaction,
either: (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; or (b)
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to
such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease complies with the Indenture and
that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer or lease have been complied with or satisfied and that the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Issuer or the Company, as the case may be. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on
such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to
be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to
have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company which properties and assets, if
held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of
the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and
assets of the Company.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Issuer or the Company, as the case may be, under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under such Indenture, the Parent Guarantee or
the Senior Secured Notes, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence) and, other than with respect_
to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant: (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the
Company; (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of
its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary; and (c) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions
referred to in this sentence), each of the Issuer and the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge
into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer or the Company,
as the case may be, reincorporating the Issuer or the Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the
Issuer or the Company.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant) will
not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and transfer of any assets of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to it.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than the Company) may:

203


-----

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless

(i) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction); or

(ii) (A) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person expressly assumes (in each case subject to any
limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) all of the
obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Security Documents
(and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement); and

(B) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred
and is continuing; or

(iii) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (ii) and the provisions described above under “—The Company and the
_Issuer” (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence): (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate_
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor; (b) any Guarantor
may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other
Guarantor; and (c) the Guarantors may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (ii)(B) (which
does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with
or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor
reincorporating the Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the satisfaction of or availability under any Applicable Metric in the Indenture in connection
with any Applicable Transaction, the date of determination of such Applicable Metric shall, at the option of the Company,
be any Applicable Test Date. If the Company elects to determine any Applicable Metric as of any Applicable Test Date,
it shall give pro forma effect to any other Applicable Transactions that have occurred up to (and including) such
Applicable Test Date; provided that the pro forma calculation may exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and expenses
attributable to any Applicable Transaction.

If compliance with an Applicable Metric is established in accordance with the prior paragraph, such Applicable
Metric shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes; provided that (1) the Company may
elect, in its sole discretion, to recalculate any Applicable Metric on the basis of a more recent Applicable Test Date, in
which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the relevant Applicable Test Date for purposes
of such Applicable Metrics; and (2) save as contemplated in clause (1) above, compliance with any Applicable Metric
shall not be determined or tested at any time after the relevant Applicable Test Date for such transaction and any actions
or transactions related thereto.

If any Applicable Metric for which compliance was determined or tested as of an Applicable Test Date would at
any time after the Applicable Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of
fluctuations in such Applicable Metric (or any other Applicable Metric), such Applicable Metric will not be deemed to
have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations.

204


-----

If any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of
Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the Applicable Test Date would at any time
after the Applicable Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation
of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be
complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing).

If an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) is committed, Incurred or issued, any Lien is committed or
Incurred or any other transaction is undertaken or any Applicable Metric is tested in reliance on a ratio-based basket based
on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or any
other ratio-based Applicable Metric, such ratios shall be calculated without regard to the Incurrence of any Indebtedness
to finance the working capital needs of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under any revolving facility, letter of
credit facility, bank guarantee facility or bonding facility and/or other debt which is available to be re-drawn (including
under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any guarantee facility or any ancillary facility under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement) and, for the avoidance of doubt, any undrawn commitments for Indebtedness (including under a
revolving facility or guarantee facility) shall be disregarded for the purposes of testing the Applicable Metric.

Subject to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if a proposed action, matter, transaction
or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed basket amount and at a later time would
subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, when calculating any financial definition or ratio
under the Indenture, the Company shall be permitted to exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item
(and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from (1) the Transactions; (2) any other
acquisition, Investment or other joint venture permitted by the terms of the Indenture or the impact from purchase price
accounting; (3) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or re-branding of existing businesses; (4) costs or expenses
relating to employee relocation, retraining, severance and termination, business interruption, reorganization and other
restructuring or cost cutting measures, the rationalization, re-branding, start up, reduction or elimination of product lines,
assets or businesses, the consolidation, relocation or closure of retail, administrative or production locations and other
similar items (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any related capital expenditure); and/or (5) research and development
expenditure (and the capitalization thereof).

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Company will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, other than the
Issuer, directly or indirectly, to guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (or other
Indebtedness that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”), in whole or in part unless, in each case, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on_
which such other guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee, which
Guarantee will be subordinated to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the Trustee
a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide
a Guarantee.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary to
guarantee the Senior Secured Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee
could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or regulation; (2) any liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such
Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the
partners of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or
regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection
with, such Guarantee, which in any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through

205


-----

measures reasonably available to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) an inconsistency with the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that
the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the
Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral)
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary
to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the covenant
entitled “—Limitation on Liens”; provided, that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over
any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral
Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien in
accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents may be
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change
thereto that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that, (except where permitted
by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted Collateral Liens for the
benefit of the Security Agent and holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance with the Indenture), no Security
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate
retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Company delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either: (1) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an
Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets); (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the
relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or replacement; or (3) an Opinion of Counsel
(subject to any qualifications customary for this type of opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended, extended, renewed,
restated, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement and to
which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such actions
without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Lines of Business_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a
Similar Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not
apply to such Senior Secured Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—

206


-----

_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “—_
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Guarantees,” “—Lines of Business,” and the_
provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Company and the Issuer,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture (the “Suspended Covenants”)_
will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and
any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event
ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Company properly
taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be
interpreted as if it had been in effect since the date of such Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have
occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Company’s option, as
having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or
one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted
to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension
Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred
under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will
be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” In addition, on the Reversion Date, (1) any
Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during the continuance
of the Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions” and (2) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during the continuance of the Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause
(1)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries.”_

The Company shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such
notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall
not be obliged to notify Holders of such event.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, no Default, Event of
Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees
with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for
any actions taken or events occurring during the continuance of the Suspension Event, or any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during the continuance of the Suspension Event, in each case as a result of
a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the continuance of the Suspension Event (or, upon termination
of the Suspension Event or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the continuance
of the Suspension Event), and following a Reversion Date, the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted,
without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments
or obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note when
due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note issued
under the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the
Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with
any of the Issuer’s or the Company’s obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of
_Control” above or under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” above (in each case,_
other than a failure to purchase Senior Secured Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under
clause (2) above);

207


-----

(4) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice
by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
**provision”);**

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €250 million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Company, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating
in excess of €250 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days
after the judgment becomes final and due (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in
excess of €250 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for
any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release or
amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or such Security Document or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared
invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any
such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the
“security default provision”); and

(9) any Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations
under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee default provision”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes notify
the Company (and, in the case of notice from the Holders, the Trustee) of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4),
(5) and (7), the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable,
of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such
Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts,
if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and
accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of
a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under

208


-----

“Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5)
shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event
of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and
if: (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction; and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and
be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured
Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or
cost and fee cover satisfactory to the Trustee against any losses, liabilities, fees or expenses which might be incurred by
it in compliance with such request or direction. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest
when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover
satisfactory to it against any losses, liabilities, fees or expenses;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
not given the Trustee a written direction that is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in
the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise
or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any
other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the
Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses,
liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and written notice of such occurrence is
received by a trust officer of the Trustee from the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and
so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or trust officers of the Trustee
in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to
the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers
thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee,
within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute
certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

209


-----

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the
Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee
will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover to it, and it
will be for Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may
not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured
Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Senior Secured
Notes); provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Senior Secured
Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series
shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the time
at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—
_Optional Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment of principal or interest on or
with respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or amends
the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any
of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release: (i) the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral; or (ii) any
Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Document or the Indenture, as
applicable, except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence.

210


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other parties
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, mistake, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Senior Secured
Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under
any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Senior Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Senior Secured
Notes (provided that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are issued in registered form for purposes
of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner such that the uncertificated Senior Secured Notes are
described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) (make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance of
Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add security to_
or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents)
with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or
retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, in any
property which is required by the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to
be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the
Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person;
_provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant_
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) to provide for the release or addition of Collateral or Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents; or

(11) to add any Pari Passu Indebtedness or other Indebtedness or obligations to any Security Documents to
the extent permitted by the Indenture.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely on such evidence as
it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A
consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection
with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

211


-----

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Senior Secured Notes owned by the Company or by any Subsidiary or
any Holding Company will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under any series of the Senior
Secured Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing
temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured
Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to
the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants described under
“—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company and the Issuer” and clause (A), (B) and (C) of the covenant_
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and
default provisions relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the crossdefault upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company
and its Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the security default
provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the applicable series of
Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Secured Notes.
If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to any series of the Senior Secured Notes, payment of
such Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with
respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Company and the Issuer” and clauses (i), (ii), (iii) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and_
_Consolidation—Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or eurodenominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and
any other Senior Secured Notes denominated in euro) and cash or Other Government Obligations or a combination thereof
in the currency or currencies in which any other Senior Secured Notes are denominated (with respect to any Senior
Secured Notes denominated in any currency other than euro), as applicable, in each case for the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel from United States counsel to the effect that Holders of the applicable series of
Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount
and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel from
United States counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change
in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the applicable series of Senior Secured
Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with or
satisfied;

212


-----

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is
qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940; and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection with
either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will be discharged
and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights (including with respect to conversion or transfer or exchange
of the Senior Secured Notes), as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to any series of outstanding Senior Secured
Notes when: (1) either: (a) all the Senior Secured Notes of such series previously authenticated and delivered (other than
certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes of such series not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation: (i)
have become due and payable; (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year; or (iii) are to be
called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with
the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in euros or eurodenominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (with respect to the Senior Secured Notes of
such series and any other series of Senior Secured Notes denominated in euro) and cash or Other Government Obligations
or a combination thereof in the currency or currencies in which any other series of Senior Secured Notes are denominated
(with respect to any series of Senior Secured Notes denominated in any currency other than euro), as applicable, in each
case in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such series of Senior Secured Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in
the case of a series of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption
date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the
Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions under the Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment of such
series of Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
“—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with
respect to such series of Senior Secured Notes have been complied with or satisfied, provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and
(3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer, or any Guarantor or any of
their Subsidiaries under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide
that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform such duties and only such duties as
are set forth specifically in such Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into the Indenture against
the Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers
vested in it by the Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise
or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others: (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer;
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time: (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest as defined in the Trustee Indenture Act
Section 310(b) that is not eliminated; or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may
petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

213


-----

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any losses, damages, claims,
liabilities, taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. Each of the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be
entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any Officer’s Certificate in formulating its opinion or in taking any action
(including, without limitation, release of a Guarantee or Collateral) under the Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s
Certificate without need for investigation or verification (including for the avoidance of doubt the receipt of Opinions of
Counsel), except as may otherwise be expressly required under the terms of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Senior Secured Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any of the Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and for so long as the rules of the Authority shall so
require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any notice with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, for so
long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear
and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice
or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and
shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to send a notice or
communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Senior
Secured Notes or any Guarantee will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims
against the Issuer for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed three years after the applicable
due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors
under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages
(the “Required Currency”). Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Required Currency, whether
as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution
of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it
from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent
of the amount of the Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered
in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date,
on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that amount of Required Currency is less than the amount of Required Currency expressed to be due to the
recipient or the Trustee under any Senior Secured Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any
loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this
currency indemnity provision, it will be _prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior_
Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of
information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Guarantee
or to the Trustee.

214


-----

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-euro
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro amount is
Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since, as of the Issue Date, certain assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are held by Subsidiaries located outside
the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments
with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price
and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees, may be difficult to collect in full
within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of
New York, United States.

the Company may revoke and re-make at any time and from time to time):

-----

available to the Fixed Charges of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such four consecutive fiscal quarters. In
the event that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems, defeases, retires or
extinguishes any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred under any revolving credit facility, unless such
Indebtedness has been permanently repaid and has not been replaced) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated but
prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the
“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving
pro forma effect to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, defeasance, retirement or extinguishment of
Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, provided that the pro forma calculation of Fixed Charges shall not give
effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions
of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the
discharge on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge
results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Sale, Purchase, Specified Transaction or Group
Initiative that have been made or implemented by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the fourquarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio Calculation Date may be calculated on a pro forma basis in a manner consistent with the adjustments
described in the definition of “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio,” assuming that all such Sales, Purchases, Specified
Transactions and Group Initiatives (and any change in any associated fixed charge obligations and any change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom), including the full run rate effect of anticipated synergies and savings, had
occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period.

If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged
with or into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made or
implemented any Sale, Purchase, Specified Transaction or Group Initiative that would have permitted or required
adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may (or, where applicable, shall) be
calculated giving pro forma effect thereto, including anticipated synergies and savings, for such period as if such Sale,
Purchase, Specified Transaction or Group Initiative and the full run rate effect of such anticipated synergies and savings
had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by the chief financial officer or finance director of the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary (or such other person as is performing the functions of the chief financial officer or finance director),
including synergies and savings. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect,
the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation
Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such
Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably
determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to be
the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the
computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit or similar facility computed on a pro
forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period
except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at
an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be
determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the
Company may designate. For the purpose of calculating pro forma effect under this definition, pro forma effect may also
be given to anticipated acquisitions where the Indebtedness to be Incurred is to finance such acquisitions in whole or in
part, which have not yet occurred but which have become subject to a definitive purchase agreement or other contract.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

(1) Consolidated Financial Interest Expense of such Person for such period;

series of Disqualified Stock during such period; and

228

Subsidiaries,

determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with IFRS.

such other Person (whether arising by virtue of partnership arrangements, or by agreements to keepwell, to purchase assets, goods, securities or services, to take-or-pay or to maintain financial statement
conditions or otherwise); or

(2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such Indebtedness of
the payment thereof or to protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in whole or in part);

Restricted Subsidiary at the time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and the terms “Incurred” and “Incurrence” have
meanings correlative to the foregoing and any Indebtedness pursuant to any revolving credit or similar facility shall only
be “Incurred” at the time any funds are borrowed thereunder.

“Indebtedness” means, with respect to any Person on any date of determination (without duplication):

for payment, if later the date 180 days after the expiry of that period), for the avoidance of doubt
excluding where the payment deferral results from the delayed or non-satisfaction of contract terms by
the supplier, from a dispute carried out in good faith or from contract terms establishing payment
schedules tied to total or partial contract completion and/or to the results of operational testing
procedures and excluding earn outs and other contingent consideration arrangements);

(5) Capitalized Lease Obligations of such Person;

(6) the principal component of all obligations, or liquidation preference, of such Person with respect to any

Person, whether or not such Indebtedness is assumed by such Person; _provided,_ _however, that the_

The amount of Indebtedness of any Person at any time in the case of a revolving credit or similar facility shall
be the total amounts of funds borrowed and then outstanding. In relation to any Indebtedness in respect of bank accounts
subject to netting, cash pooling, net balance, balance transfer or similar arrangements, only the net balance shall be used.
The amount of Indebtedness of any Person at any date shall be determined as set forth above or otherwise provided in the
Indenture, and (other than with respect to letters of credit or guarantees or Indebtedness specified in clause (7) or (8)
above) shall equal the amount thereof that would appear on a balance sheet of such Person (excluding any notes thereto)
prepared on the basis of IFRS.

Notwithstanding the above provisions, in no event shall the following constitute Indebtedness:

(a) Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

(b) any lease, concession or license of property (or guarantee thereof) which would be considered

Indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Indebtedness is excluded pursuant to this
clause (xiv), any associated cash deposited in connection therewith shall not offset the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio;

(hoofdelijke aansprakelijkheid) as referred to in Article 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under
the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The Senior Secured Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be
represented by global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Notes” and,
together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited upon
issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Senior Secured Notes may only be offered or sold within the United States pursuant to an exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests
will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear
and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in denominations
of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Except under the limited circumstances described below,
Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Senior Secured Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will
not have the Senior Secured Notes registered in their name, receive physical delivery of the Senior Secured Notes in
certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of the Senior Secured Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in global form, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or
their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture
governing the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the
participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of
Noteholders under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, any of the Agents, nor any of their respective agents will
have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records, or for payments made, relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their
respective nominees, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to
the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption
of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will
be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream,
if fewer than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary
requirements; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed
in part.

253


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if
any, and interest) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary
for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by
law or by the interpretation or administration thereof and as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under_
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes.” above, we will pay additional amounts as may be
necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes after such deduction or withholding to
equal the net amounts that such holder would have otherwise received in respect of the Global Notes absent such deduction
or withholding. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by
participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents or any of their respective agents will treat
the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary or its nominee) as the owner thereof for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, any of
the, Trustee, the Agents, nor or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant;

    - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

    - Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of
such participants as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “stock name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, any of the Agents,
nor any of their respective agents nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any Noteholder or any other person
for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding
effected in connection with any such payment. Noteholders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have
economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Global Notes
will be paid to holders of interests in such Senior Secured Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a Noteholder
only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect
of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes as to which such participant or participants
has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the
Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the Noteholders, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes
for Definitive Registered Notes and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below) to their respective
participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a Noteholder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Senior Secured Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require

254


-----

physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Senior Secured Notes, such Noteholder must transfer its interests in the
Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the
procedures set out in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation
S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act
or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Through and including the 40th day after the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the issue
date of the Senior Secured Notes, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of
a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer
_Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction. After the expiration of such_
40-day period, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest without compliance with these certification requirements.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A bookentry interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S
Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only
as described under the Indenture and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Registrar a written certificate
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first
mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it remains such a book-entry interest. In the event additional Senior Secured Notes are issued pursuant
to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification number as the initial notes
previously issued, without being fungible with the initial notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests
in the Regulation S Global Notes (including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes on or prior to the date of issuance of such additional Senior Secured Notes) will not be eligible for transfer
to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any).

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Senior Secured
Notes in registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(i) if Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue
to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

(ii) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, following an Event of Default under the Indenture and enforcement action
is being taken in respect thereof.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or causes to
be issued Senior Secured Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the
owner who made the initial request.

In such an event described in clauses (i) and (ii), the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered
in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or

255


-----

the Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received
from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will
bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable
law.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Senior Secured Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or Transfer Agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a
partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive
Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in
respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as
applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued. We will bear
the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15
calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes, (ii) any date fixed
for redemption of the Senior Secured Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed
in part. Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Senior Secured Notes selected for redemption
or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of control offer. In the
event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar may require a
holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture.
We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the
registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or an authentication agent appointed by it)
will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. The Issuer or
the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the
Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge
for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer, pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Issuer in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes only
after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. Please see “Transfer Restrictions.”

Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable
at the office of the Issuer’s Paying Agent in London.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents and their respective agents shall be entitled to
treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the
registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Senior Secured Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Senior Secured Notes; however, owners of
the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream as applicable.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be
changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the Agents nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

256


-----

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities
for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their
respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream
provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending
and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.
Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities
that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may
be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons
take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such
persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Senior Secured Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on
the Official List of the Exchange. The Senior Secured Notes are expected to be accepted for clearance through the facilities
of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers and common code numbers for the
Notes are set out under “Listing and General Information.” Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants
in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at
any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, any of the Agents, nor any of their respective agents will
have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Senior Secured Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream on
the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day
funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any BookEntry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on
the desired value date.

**Trustee’s Powers**

In considering the interests of the Noteholders, while title of the Senior Secured Notes is registered in the name
of a nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information provided to it by
that clearing system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its accountholders with entitlements to the
Senior Secured Notes and may consider such interests as if such accountholders were the Noteholders.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Senior Secured Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes. This summary deals only with Senior Secured Notes held as capital assets
(within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) by U.S. holders
(as defined below) who purchase the Senior Secured Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their “issue price” (the
first price at which a substantial amount of the Senior Secured Notes of the applicable series is sold for money to investors,
excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter,
placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes that is, for United States
federal income tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes)
that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United
States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in
effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds Senior
Secured Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Senior Secured Notes,
you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences
applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation:

    - a dealer in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - an insurance company;

    - a person holding the Senior Secured Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

    - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity);

    - a person whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

258


-----

    - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial
decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United
States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings
from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the
IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Senior
Secured Notes that are different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences to
you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income
or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be,
legal or tax advice to any particular purchaser of Senior Secured Notes.

**If you are considering the purchase of Senior Secured Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors**
**concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and**
**disposition of the Senior Secured Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal**
**tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_IPO Pushdown_**

An IPO Pushdown (as defined in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”) could result in a taxable exchange
of the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case you may recognize gain or loss on the
Senior Secured Notes (although any such loss may be disallowed) at such time equal to the difference, if any, between
the issue price of the deemed newly issued Senior Secured Notes (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
and your adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Notes, and have a new holding period and tax basis in the Senior Secured
Notes. Any such gain or loss will be taxed under the rules described below under “—Sale, exchange, retirement,
_redemption or other taxable disposition of Senior Secured Notes.” If the fair market value of the Senior Secured Notes at_
the time of such taxable exchange were lower than the stated redemption price by more than a de minimis amount, you
may be required to include the difference as ordinary income as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) in
advance of the receipt of cash. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the potential U.S. federal income tax
consequences to you in the event of an IPO Pushdown.

**_Payments of interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Senior Secured Note will generally be taxable
to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for United States
federal income tax purposes. Interest income on a Senior Secured Note will generally be considered foreign source income
and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will generally be considered passive category income. You will
generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Senior Secured Notes where you do
not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing
the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax
credit under your particular circumstances.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable in euros. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for
United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar
value of the amount of interest received on the Senior Secured Notes, determined by translating the amount of foreign
currency received (if any) at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in
fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment
(other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the foreign currency so received).

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine
the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the Senior Secured Notes in accordance with either of two
methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the
U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Senior Secured Notes held during such year, determined by
translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such
interest accrued. Under the second method, you may translate interest income at the spot rate on:

    - the last day of the accrual period;

    - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or

259


-----

    - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual
period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments
from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you use the accrual method of
accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Senior Secured Note (including, upon the sale of a Senior Secured
Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you
will recognize ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment
(determined by translating the amount of foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received)
and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Senior Secured Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note, you
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued and unpaid interest, which
will be taxable as interest income as discussed above in “—Payments of interest”) and the adjusted tax basis of the Senior
Secured Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Senior Secured Note will generally be your cost for that Note. If you purchased
a Senior Secured Note with foreign currency, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount of foreign
currency paid for such Senior Secured Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase (or, in the case of a
cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the Senior Secured Note is treated as
traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired
or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros or U.S. dollars (as may be applicable), then your amount
realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange,
retirement or disposition, if the Senior Secured Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S.
federal income tax purposes). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes,
you may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Senior Secured Notes traded on an established
securities market, provided that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year.
Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss
you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held
the Senior Secured Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including
individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain
or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Senior Secured Note may be treated as
exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss.
For these purposes, the principal amount of the Senior Secured Note is your purchase price for the Senior Secured Note
calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference
between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount
determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Senior Secured Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or
electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Senior Secured Note
is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange
gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the Senior Secured Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest)
will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Senior Secured Note.

**_Disposition of foreign currency_**

Your tax basis in euros received as interest on a Euro Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Euro Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the euros are received.
Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other disposition of the euros will generally be treated as U.S.
source ordinary income or loss.

**_Reportable transactions_**

United States Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign
currency transactions. Under the United States Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the

260


-----

IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency
note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement
or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of a
Senior Secured Note, you should consult with your own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with
respect to an investment in the Senior Secured Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

Generally, information reporting will apply to all payments of interest and principal on a Senior Secured Note
and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Senior Secured Note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient.
Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments, fail either to
report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding on
any such payments or proceeds.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will
be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information
is timely furnished to the IRS.

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Senior Secured Notes, subject
to certain exceptions (including an exception for Senior Secured Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial
institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, with their tax
return for each year in which they hold an interest in the Senior Secured Notes. You are urged to consult your own tax
advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to your ownership of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain Dutch Tax Considerations**

This summary solely addresses the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposal
of Senior Secured Notes and does not purport to describe every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a particular
holder. Tax matters are complex, and the tax consequences of this offering to a particular holder of Senior Secured Notes
will depend in part on such holder’s circumstances. Accordingly, a holder is urged to consult his own tax advisor for a
full understanding of the tax consequences of this offering to him, including the applicability and effect of Dutch tax laws.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to be
attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts under
Dutch tax law. Where in this summary the terms “the Netherlands” and “Dutch” are used, these refer solely to the
European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This summary assumes that the Issuer is organized, and that its business
will be conducted, in the manner outlined in this offering memorandum. A change to such organizational structure or to
the manner in which the Issuer conducts its business may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be
updated to reflect any such change.

This summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at the
date of this Offering Memorandum. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is subject to changes, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect
such change.

The summary in this Dutch taxation section does not address the Dutch tax consequences for a holder of Senior
Secured Notes who:

    - is an individual or corporate entity, including an association, partnership and mutual fund, taxable as a
corporate entity, who may be deemed an owner of Senior Secured Notes for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to
specific statutory attribution rules in Dutch tax law;

    - is an individual (or is a related person of the individual) or corporate entity which holds or is deemed to hold
a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer;

    - is a corporate entity that is, in whole or in part, not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax,
such as fiscal investment institutions, exempt investment institutions and pension funds as defined in the
Dutch Corporation Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969);

    - owns Senior Secured Notes in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory board,
an employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role;

261


-----

    - is a corporate entity, being resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten; or

    - is not considered the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of the Senior Secured Notes and/or the
benefits derived from the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Withholding tax_**

All payments under the Senior Secured Notes may in principle be made free from withholding or deduction of
or for any taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision
or taxing authority of or in the Netherlands. However, it should be noted that (deemed) interest payments to an affiliated
(gelieerde) entity of the Issuer may be taxed with Dutch withholding tax to a rate of 25.8% if the beneficiary
(voordeelgerechtigde) of the payment is (i) an entity tax resident in a low-tax jurisdiction or the benefit of the payment is
attributable to an entity / permanent establishment in a low-tax jurisdiction or (ii) an entity not tax resident in a low-tax
jurisdiction but established in a jurisdiction receiving the payment with the aim to avoid taxation (subjective test) and the
construction should be considered artificial (objective test)), all within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act
2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021). A jurisdiction is qualified as “low-tax” if (i) the entity is not subject to tax or to a tax rate
of less than 9% or (ii) if the jurisdiction is included in the EU-list of non-cooperative jurisdictions in the year of the
payment.

**_Taxes on income and capital gains_**

_Resident holders of Senior Secured Notes_

In general, a holder of Senior Secured Notes who is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for
Dutch tax purposes is fully subject to Dutch personal income tax if he is an individual or fully subject to Dutch corporate
income tax if it is a corporate entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund, taxable as a corporate
entity, as described in the summary below.

_Individuals deriving profits or deemed to be deriving profits from an enterprise_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Senior Secured Notes that are
attributable to an enterprise from which an individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant
to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise (mede-gerechtigde tot het vermogen), other than as a shareholder, are
generally subject to Dutch personal income tax at progressive rates up to 49.50%.

_Individuals deriving benefits from miscellaneous activities_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Senior Secured Notes that constitute
benefits from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) by an individual, including activities that
go beyond regular active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer), are generally subject to Dutch
personal income tax at progressive rates up to 49.50%.

_Other individuals_

If a holder of Senior Secured Notes is an individual whose situation has not been discussed before in this section
“Dutch Tax Considerations—Taxes on income and capital gains—Resident holders of Senior Secured Notes,” the fair
market value of his Senior Secured Notes forms part of the yield basis for purposes of tax on benefits from savings and
investments. A deemed benefit, which is for other investments (overige bezittingen), that includes the Senior Secured
Notes, determined on the basis of a rate of 6.04% (in 2024) per annum of this yield basis is taxed at the rate of 36%, if
the yield basis exceeds a certain threshold. Actual income, gains or losses derived from or in connection with the Senior
Secured Notes are not subject to Dutch personal income tax.

_Corporate entities_

A corporate entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund being resident or deemed to be
resident of the Netherlands for the Dutch corporate income tax, holding a Senior Secured Note will generally be subject
to Dutch corporate income tax at a rate of 19% for profits up to €200,000 and 25.8% for profits above in respect of all
benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with the Senior Secured Note.

262


-----

_General_

A holder of Senior Secured Notes will not be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes
by reason only of the execution and/or enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of the Senior Secured Notes or
the performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Senior Secured Notes.

_Non-resident holders of Senior Secured Notes_

Individuals

If a holder of Senior Secured Notes is an individual who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch personal income tax, he will not be subject to Dutch personal income tax in respect of
any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Senior Secured Notes, except if:

    - he derives profits from an enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a coentitlement to the net value of such enterprise (mede-gerechtigde tot het vermogen), other than as a
shareholder, and such enterprise is carried on, in whole or in part, through a permanent establishment (vaste
_inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands, and his Senior_
Secured Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative; or

    - he derives benefits or is deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Senior Secured Notes that are
taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), including activities
that go beyond regular active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer), performed in the
Netherlands.

Corporate entities

If a holder of Senior Secured Notes is a corporate entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual
fund, taxable as a corporate entity, which is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of
Dutch corporation tax, it will not be subject to Dutch corporate income tax in respect of any benefits derived or deemed
to be derived from or in connection with Senior Secured Notes, except if:

    - it derives profits from an enterprise directly which is carried on, in whole or in part, through a permanent
establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) which is taxable
in the Netherlands, and to which permanent establishment or permanent representative its Senior Secured
Notes are attributable; or

    - it derives profits pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise (mede-gerechtigde tot het
_vermogen) which is managed in the Netherlands, other than as a holder of securities, and to which enterprise_
its Senior Secured Notes are attributable.

_General_

If a holder of Senior Secured Notes is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such holder
will for Dutch tax purposes not carry on or be deemed to carry on an enterprise, in whole or in part, through a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands by reason only of the execution and/or enforcement of the
documents relating to the issue of the Senior Secured Notes or the performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such
documents or under the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Gift and inheritance taxes_**

Dutch gift or inheritance tax will arise with respect to a transfer of Senior Secured Notes by way of gift or upon
the death of a holder of Senior Secured Notes who is resident, or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands at the time
of the gift or his death. No Dutch gift or inheritance tax will arise when a holder of Senior Secured Notes is not resident,
or deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time of the gift, unless:

    - the holder of a Senior Secured Note is an individual, not being resident, or deemed to be resident, of the
Netherlands at the time of the gift, and dies within 180 days after the date of the gift being a resident, or
deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands.

    - the gift is made under a condition precedent and at the time of this condition is fulfilled, the holder of a
Senior Secured Note is resident, or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands.

263


-----

For Dutch gift and inheritance tax purposes, an individual holding the Dutch nationality is deemed to be resident
in the Netherlands, if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the past ten years.

For Dutch gift and inheritance tax purposes, an individual, not holding the Dutch nationality, is deemed to be
resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the twelve months preceding the
date of the gift.

**_Registration taxes and duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, transfer tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty, other than court
fees, will be payable by the holder of Senior Secured Notes in the Netherlands in respect of or in connection with the
execution and/or enforcement (including by legal proceedings and including the enforcement of any foreign judgment in
the courts of the Netherlands) of the documents relating to the issue of the Senior Secured Notes, the performance by the
Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Senior Secured Notes, or the transfer of the Senior Secured
Notes.

264


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Senior
Secured Notes by (i) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I
of ERISA, (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or
other laws or regulations that are similar to the fiduciary responsibility and/or prohibited transaction provision of Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and (iii) entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include the assets of any of the foregoing described in clauses (i) and (ii) (each of the foregoing described
in clauses (i) and (ii) referred to herein as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan which is subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Covered
Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary
authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such
a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to a Covered Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the Senior Secured Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code
and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in
interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and
other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in
such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The
acquisition and/or holding of Senior Secured Notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, or the Guarantors is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct
or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is
acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In
this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply
to the acquisition and holding of the Senior Secured Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 8414 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting
insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60
respecting insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of
Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Senior Secured Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption
should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of
any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33)
of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code,
may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before
purchasing the Senior Secured Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of any exemptive relief
under any applicable Similar Law.

Because of the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing “plan
assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation of any
applicable Similar Laws.

265


-----

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Senior Secured Note will be deemed to have given the
acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is
particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of, or
with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of
the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the Senior Secured Notes.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL**

**AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security_
_interests in each of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are organized (other than the United States)._
_It is a summary only, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a similar event could be initiated in any of these_
_jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes. The application of_
_these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could_
_adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Senior Secured Notes, the_
_Guarantees and the security interests on the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of_
_insolvency law in the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany and England and Wales._

**European Union**

The Issuer and several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of member states of the European Union
(the “Member States,” and each a “Member State”). As such, they are subject to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council dated May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU Insolvency
**Regulation”), which entered into force on June 26, 2015, and applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June**
26, 2017.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court, which has jurisdiction to open “main insolvency
proceedings” in relation to a company, is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
concerned has its “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The
determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of
the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the “center of main interests” of a debtor shall be the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” There is a
rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any company or legal person has its
“center of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office.

The rebuttable presumption that a company has its “center of main interests” in the Member State in which it
has its registered office shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the
three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to
rebut this presumption if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered
office, and if a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third
parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located
in that other Member State. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company
conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the large majority of the company’s
creditors are established may all be relevant.

Where the “center of main interests” of a company is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main
insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such
jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency
proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one
Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized and given effect to (subject to some exceptions)
in all the other Member States (other than Denmark), although “secondary proceedings” may be opened in another
Member State (other than Denmark), in the circumstances described below. If the company does not have an establishment
in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open secondary proceedings in respect
of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State
shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable
assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the
debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in
_rem include:_

    - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or
income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

267


-----

    - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or
by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

    - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them
contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

    - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of a Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” (before
the opening of main insolvency proceedings) or “secondary proceedings” (after the opening of main insolvency
proceedings) only in the event that a debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State (not being
the Member State in which such debtor has its “center of main interest”). For territorial proceedings only, there is the
additional requirement that they can only be opened where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the
Member State in which the debtor’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial
insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the
operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial
proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which
the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. The effects of “territorial
proceedings” or “secondary proceedings” shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the
Member State where such proceedings are opened. The determination of whether a company has an “establishment” and
where it is situated is also a question of fact and is not a static concept. As such, an establishment could be created and
may change from time to time. According to Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, an “establishment” means
any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open
main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Accordingly, the opening
of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor
had an establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency
proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary
insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of
the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving
a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings
could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply
with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency
proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to
approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other
Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open
secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests
of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the
court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the
opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures
are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of
no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods.
Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency
proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency
Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under
Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in

268


-----

insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the
relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency
practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries or a Guarantor experience financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of
the obligations of, and the security granted by, the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries and/or any Guarantor. The insolvency
and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different
from, or (subject to the framework provided for under the EU Insolvency Regulation) conflict with, each other and there
is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one
another.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Considerations_**

Subject to the limitations described above “—European Union,” where a company (incorporated in the
Netherlands or elsewhere) has its “center of main interests” or an “establishment” in the Netherlands, it may be subjected
to Dutch insolvency proceedings. This is particularly relevant for the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, which have
their corporate seats (statutaire zetel) in the Netherlands, and are therefore each presumed (subject to proof to the contrary)
to have their “center of main interests” in the Netherlands. Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency
proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Senior Secured Notes to
recover the amount they would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another
jurisdiction.

The following is an outline of certain aspects of Dutch law and practice relating to insolvency laws. This is not
a complete summary of currently applicable Dutch law or practice, and should not be treated as a substitute for
professional advice. Prospective holders of Senior Secured Notes who are in any doubt as to any matter described in this
Offering Memorandum should consult their own professional advisors.

**_General_**

There are three insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities: the first, suspension of payments
(surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to
continue as a going concern. In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. The second, bankruptcy
(faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. The
third, a composition outside bankruptcy or moratorium of payments proceedings, allows debtors in (early) financial
distress to propose restructuring plans to their creditors and shareholders outside of formal insolvency proceedings, with
the prospect of the debtor being able to continue on a going-concern basis. All three insolvency regimes are set forth in
the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of these insolvency regimes is set
forth below.

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be
unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately
(dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of
creditors is required to vote on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed
simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be
processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional
suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority
(more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than onethird of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors
withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that
the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will
be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on
the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments.

269


-----

The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch
law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets
of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery
under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor.
However, at the request of an interested party (which includes the debtor) the court can order a “cooling down period”
(afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of
two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred.

Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition
will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of
creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged
and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.

Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the Noteholders to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a Noteholder in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest
accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a
court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the
debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be
suspended or cancelled by operation of law.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of
the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in
certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. Furthermore, the debtor can request the
application of bankruptcy proceedings itself _provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an_
application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting
approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of
bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its
own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its
debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading,
notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above).

As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order
takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds
distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general
principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors
have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the
size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities)
will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could
reduce a Noteholder’s potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and
the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to
what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have
been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing
after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be
admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the Noteholders may be challenged
in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver
(curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors
whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings
(renvooiprocedure). In these proceedings the court will decide whether a claim is valid (and for which amount). Therefore,
these proceedings could cause Noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Senior Secured Notes or less
than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such _renvoi_ proceedings could also cause payments to the
Noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential
creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets

270


-----

subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may
request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of
their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset
the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period
for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the
remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified.

As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to
creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in
number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are
acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does
not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors in the context of voting on a composition in bankruptcy,
which is different in WHOA proceedings as described below. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured
and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a
pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The
actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for
another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors
have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured
creditor to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to
sell the secured assets, if any, and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which
may be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off
against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act
performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of
the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters
into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be
challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in
bankruptcy. See below “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.”

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments
against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and
certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of
the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy
estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the
secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy
order is automatically stayed.

As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to
creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in
number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are
acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does
not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured
and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a
pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The
actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed.

_Dutch Scheme_

With the implementation in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act and the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation
of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on January 1, 2021, debtors
now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is based on the
UK Scheme of Arrangements and the U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings and it offers debtors additional possibilities to
restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in moratorium of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition
under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross
class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous
contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition
may result in claims against a Dutch debtor being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a
composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can, in certain

271


-----

circumstances, extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the
Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
under the Indenture and therefore the Senior Secured Notes.

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the
total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class,
participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on
a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least
one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a
bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse
confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution
that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy
of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value
that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a
reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors.
If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors
do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the
request of such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible
extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the
possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets
of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors.
Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on
the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the
claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, and to accommodate for the Security
Agent holding the security for and on behalf of all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the Holders under or in connection with the
Indenture. A pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel
Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or
mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of
Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, Holders
will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition,
the Holders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary
of the Parallel Debt.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Under Dutch law, the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the security
interests over the Collateral may, in whole or in part, also be affected or limited to the extent that the obligations of the
Issuer or the Guarantors which are incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantors”) are not within the scope of
their respective objects and the relevant counterparty was aware or ought to have been aware (without inquiry) of this
fact. The articles of association of each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantee and security. The articles of
association of the Issuer permit the issuing of notes and the granting of security interest. However, the determination of
whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is within the objects
of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are
served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by
such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal
act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the
relevant company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in
moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling). As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would
conclude that the issuing of the Senior Secured Notes, the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of the security
interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that

272


-----

the Issuer, a Dutch Guarantor or the bankruptcy receiver or the administrator of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor
successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of a Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such Note, Guarantee
or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document
was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake
(dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document.

Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee
or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not,
be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen
circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and
set-off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by the Issuer or Dutch
Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the
shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefore with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or
such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at
least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or,
provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20
million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and other
entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as
well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee
or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a managing director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor
of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to
understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and
would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof.
The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the managing director on the basis of which the conclusive is
justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt gemaakt kan worden) for the
detriment suffered.

The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977
Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions.

In proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate
amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.

**_Enforcement of security interests_**

In the event of the occurrence of certain events, the Security Agent may enforce the security interests created
pursuant to the relevant security documents.

In general, in insolvency proceedings, a right of mortgage and/or a right of pledge provides a creditor with the
strongest position available under Dutch law in terms of security. A (first ranking) right of mortgage or right of pledge
ranks above any other rights of priority available to creditors, including the general priority right of the Dutch tax
authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for certain exceptions. For example, under certain
circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory right of pledge over inventory (not
including stock (voorraden) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with
these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been
restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme now must inform the tax authority of their
intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been
informed.

Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to the Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition,
foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law.
Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction
has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of The Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and The
Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch B.V.

273


-----

(private company with limited liability; besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred
upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association (statuten) as
they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge over receivables can, in principle, only be enforced
(through collection of the receivable) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor.

The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent
court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets, instead of a public auction. In the event of pledged assets, the
Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has
become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall
accrue to it for a price determined by the court.

**_Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions, known as “actio pauliana,” dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in
and outside of bankruptcy. The actio pauliana provisions offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of
recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees
the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s
obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar
effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee
in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the
person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplichte rechtshandeling); (ii) the
creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as
a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was conducted for no
consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors
(existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies,
a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors
of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to
evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within
a year of the granting and for no consideration.

The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutadis mutandis
when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy.

In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis
of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted
at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or
(ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of
such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. If a
Dutch court found that the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security interest
involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Senior
Secured Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security rights could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of the
Senior Secured Notes, any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is
possible that such challenge would be successful In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Senior Secured
Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors as a
result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany and have their registered office in Germany
(together, the “German Guarantors” and each a “German Guarantor”). As further described in relation to the
insolvency considerations for the European Union above, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “center of main
interests” as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated.
Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Guarantors, is likely to be initiated in Germany,
and, if a German Guarantor were held to have its “center of main interests” within the territory of Germany at the time
the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law
would most likely govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in
Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of a Guarantor that is not organized under the laws of Germany
(for example, if its “center of main interests” is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency proceedings over a Guarantor
may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German

274


-----

Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions,
including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in
certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence
may limit the ability of the recovery of payments due on the Senior Secured Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations
arising under other insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the jurisdiction of the German
courts may be limited if the company’s “center of main interests” is found to be in a Member State other than Germany.
This issue is to be determined at the time when the competent court decides on the commencement of the relevant
insolvency proceedings.

If a Guarantor’s “center of main interests” is situated in a foreign country (other than a Member State), the
opening of territorial insolvency proceedings or secondary insolvency proceedings by a German court will be determined
by section 354 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in case of territorial insolvency proceedings or
sections 356 et seq. of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in case of secondary insolvency proceedings.
The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding
for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity and certain
other requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency
proceedings (if any) within a group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies
in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. German insolvency law
provides for rules facilitating the mastering of group insolvencies. However, they mainly relate to coordination of and
cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. They do not provide for a consolidation of the
insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulate four key pillars in order to
facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity in
insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is
facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and
the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a
“coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
officio but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag). Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or if the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor
is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation
of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period
covering the next twelve (12) months (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it
is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually
certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the
creditors to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft - AG), a
European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea - SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung - GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder such as the_
German Guarantors becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain
circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay,
however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of overindebtedness at the latest within six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations
exposes management (and any other person obliged to file for insolvency, as the case may be) to both severe damage
claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including
any payments under the Senior Secured Notes, may be voidable; this may also apply, under certain conditions, to certain
payments before the occurrence of illiquidity or over-indebtedness. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to_
service its payments obligations but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain
prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but
not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity of the debtor.

Insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance
of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag), the insolvency court may take

275


-----

preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may, inter alia, prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce
judicially individual claims against the debtor’s moveable assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the
court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the
debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) - an insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s
management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a
custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency proceeding as debtor-in-possession proceedings requires,
_inter alia, that (i) the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent self-administration planning (Eigenverwaltungsplanung)_
and (ii) no circumstances are known which indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on
inaccurate facts. In case of debtor-in-possession status is ordered, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a
preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) will be appointed who shall supervise the management of the debtor in
the preliminary insolvency proceedings with debtor-in-possession status (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung).

Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency
reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to order debtor-inpossession status and if the debtor can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor, accountant or lawyer
with experience in insolvency matters) that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich
_aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, grant a period of up to three (3) months for submission of an_
insolvency plan (so-called protective shield proceedings, Schutzschirmverfahren). During this period, the creditors’ rights
to enforce security may - upon application of the debtor - be suspended. The preliminary custodian (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter) will supervise the process. In this sub-variant of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the debtor is entitled to_
suggest an individual to be appointed as preliminary custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency
court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or
impartial).

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances, the insolvency court
must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditors’
committee will be asked to form a view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary)
insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the
members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the
court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; _i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the_
preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of
the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees.

The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s
assets (which regularly includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an
insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if
certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open
formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such
advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually,
but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency
court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders for a debtor-in-possession
status, the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the
supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the
debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the
insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as
insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change
requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of
the proposed individual becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as
officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new
financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the
insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to
any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after
realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

276


-----

From the perspective of the Noteholders, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal
insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German
insolvency regime would be the following:

  - if the court does not order debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose
of the assets of such insolvent entity would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter);

  - if the court does not order debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the management
of such insolvent entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of
law;

  - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings has acquired through judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) (e.g.,
attachment) a security interest in part of such insolvent entity’s property that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings;

  - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

  - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator
to the extent an insolvency administrator refuses to voluntarily separate such asset from the estate.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling
one party to an agreement to terminate such agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons
justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may pursuant to the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) highly dependent on the individual
circumstances - be invalid if they frustrate the right of the insolvency administrator to choose whether or not to perform
the agreement (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters). This likely also relates to agreements which are not governed by
German law.

Powers of attorney granted by a debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening
of formal insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) opts for performance.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency
estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the
insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately but can instead only enforce
them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement
action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once
insolvency proceedings have been opened. Security interests in the debtor’s assets obtained by way of judicial
enforcement action in the last month prior to the request for opening of insolvency proceedings or after such date shall
become ineffective upon opening of the proceedings. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce
any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have
certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to
enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should
be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s
possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security
transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment
agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the case of creditors secured by pledges over shares or company interests forming
part of the insolvency estate it may depend on the circumstances whether the creditors are entitled to initiate the
enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency administrator has the right
to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. A recent decision by the German Federal
Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) pertaining to enforcement of intellectual property rights (transferred as security) can
be read to grant secured creditors the enforcement right in case of non-securitized (unverbriefte) shares (such as typically
is the case with shares in a German GmbH).

277


-----

In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain
contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured
assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT
(if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its
secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the
creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any
preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all
other claims (insolvency claims - Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors and residual claims
of secured insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro
rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest
and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.

The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right for purposes of the continuation of the debtor’s
business. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such
use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of
insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of
subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims
of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Kosten des
_Insolvenzverfahrens) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically,_
liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator (or debtor and custodian in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings) after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate.
Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will
be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). It
may take several years before an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors. In insolvency
proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims of the Noteholders against such German Guarantor under
the Guarantees would only rank as unsecured insolvency claim. German insolvency law also provides for certain creditors
to be subordinated by law.

The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the unsubordinated claims of insolvency
creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty
payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs
incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines,
coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative
offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims
for the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding
in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant
company have granted the respective loan or entered into a legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a
loan; and (vi) claims which the creditor and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings.

Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the
relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the insolvent
entity. In that event, in insolvency proceedings over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims against that entity would
be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying
to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans
will itself be exposed, inter alia, to an avoidance risk with respect to repayments made within the period of one (1) year
prior to the petition to open insolvency proceedings or subsequent to such petition (section 135 of the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung)). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings
over the assets of the debtor (and, as the case may be, in transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the
case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the
majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from transaction security
(if any) were deemed to be a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents
could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent debtor, the value of
the insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s

278


-----

business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an
insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors can, under certain
circumstances, be crammed down). The debtor as insolvent entity may oppose the proposed plan but can be crammed
down if the plan is not detrimental to the insolvent company (in comparison to ordinary insolvency proceedings) and if
no creditor will receive a higher economic value than the amount of its claim. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the
shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can
be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption
of the insolvency plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of
dissenting shareholders can, under certain circumstances, also be crammed down.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-inpossession proceedings, the custodian (Sachwalter)) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that
are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully
voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such
challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or
custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to
ten (10) years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Guarantor or any other entity based on and
governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the Noteholders as well as the granting of
Collateral for or providing credit support (such as the Guarantees) for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes could be
subject to potential challenges (i.e., avoidance rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of
insolvency avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In the event
and to the extent such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the Noteholders may not be able to recover or
retain any amounts under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency
proceedings as unsecured creditors only. If payments have already been made under the Senior Secured Notes, the
Guarantees or the Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that were to be voided would have to be repaid to
the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the Noteholders would only have a general unsecured claim under
the Senior Secured Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the
granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may
be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such
act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor
was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the
creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest
such illiquidity or filing);

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
(Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time
to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken
during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such
filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor
was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that
such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly
suggest such detrimental effect);

  - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor
loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or
becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the

279


-----

counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s
illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction;

  - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or has paid for a
third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected
in the four (4) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

  - any act performed by the debtor during the ten (10) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its
insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such
intention at the time of such act; knowledge of the beneficiary of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its
insolvency creditors is presumed if the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s imminent insolvency (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), and that the transaction constituted a disadvantage for the other creditors. In the case_
that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the
above ten-year period is reduced to four (4) years. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled
a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was entitled in that form and at
that time, knowledge of such creditor of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors is (only)
presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and
that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with
the debtor, or agreed to deferred payments, establishes the presumption that he or she had no knowledge of the
debtor being illiquid at this time;

  - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the
detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the
debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate
entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management board
or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital,
persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic
situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the
foregoing persons;

  - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a
shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the
last ten (10) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing
of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or

  - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third
party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor granted security or was liable as a
guarantor (Garant) or provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but the shareholder must
compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the
insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the
insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction
prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such
party had “knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction”
(Bargeschäft) and may as such be privileged, i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to insolvency avoidance
under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right
according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) in the absence of formal insolvency proceedings. The

280


-----

prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the
date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a new directive which aims to ensure that
minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial distress to solve their
problems at an early stage and to avoid insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European Parliament and the Council
(EU) 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive
(EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development
of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the
law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (as amended from
time to time, the “Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act”) (Gesetz über den Stabilisierungs- und
_Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen (Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und -restrukturierungsgesetz - StaRUG)),_
which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-insolvency financial restructurings in Germany.
Proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated
through a notification by the respective debtor to the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des
_Restrukturierungsvorhabens)._

A debtor’s management can (but is not obliged to) access the new restructuring tools of the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which
occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over
(generally) the next 24 months. The debtor may (but is not obliged to) alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings
if the company is imminently illiquid.

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not
necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities
(with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort),
only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Senior Secured Notes), or only selected liabilities. In
addition, and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a
minimum and the tools can - under certain circumstances - even be used without the need for any public notices despite
becoming binding on all affected creditors. The tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act
may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately; however, certain tools may be extended
to cover security granted by entities that are affiliated entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor. Furthermore, the
Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act replicates the tools available under the German Insolvency Code in order
to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies.

The core component of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-insolvency restructuring
of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), including, for example, by way of changes to the
principal amounts, interest rates or maturities of liabilities as well as capital measures pertaining to the equity structure.
Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) the Guarantees and Collateral granted
for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. A
restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required
majority or majorities of a debtor’s creditors. The restructuring plan which can be submitted solely by the debtor will be
voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of at least
75% of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are generally determined by the amount of the claim,
the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor).
However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors
if certain creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided that certain requirements are met and the restructuring
court confirms the restructuring plan (cross class cramdown). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the
case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the restructuring plan (e.g., capital decrease with
subsequent capital increase and provisions on the subscription right). In this case, the adoption of the restructuring plan
generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can,
under certain circumstances, also be crammed down.

281


-----

The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor
so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a
stabilization order by the restructuring court (which can be granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization
order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a
maximum period of up to three (3) months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of
eight (8) months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the Noteholders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other entity having its “center of main interests” in
Germany would be the following:

  - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited
review or supervision by a court;

  - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to
eight (8) months due to a stabilization order upon application by the debtor;

  - any claims and rights of the Noteholders and their Collateral can be subject to and potentially be compromised
by the restructuring plan (for example, in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest
or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the
security right);

  - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra group guarantees and collateral may be subject to
Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective guarantees and collateral,
respectively; and

  - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Noteholder without
the consent of each Noteholder (generally, the relevant majority requirement is 75% of the respective voting
rights) and, if the prerequisites for a cross class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the
Noteholders.

Restructuring Proceedings which are public and corresponding restructuring plans confirmed by a German
restructuring court will be recognized in any Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation as such public
Restructuring Proceedings have been included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of said Regulation. In any other
case (i.e., “private” Restructuring Proceedings), recognition of a restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and
regulations under applicable conflict-of-laws provisions.

**_Accessory Security Interests and Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) such as pledges
(Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require that the security
holder and the creditor of the secured claim be identical. Therefore, pledges may only be granted to the creditor of a claim
to be secured by the accessory security interest and other accessory interests. Such accessory security interests (i) cannot
be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee who does not itself hold the secured claim, (ii) will automatically lapse
to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated and (iii) may not be assigned independently, but would
automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned.

The accessory security interests will be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a
creditor under the Senior Secured Notes. The Noteholders on the other hand are creditors under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Guarantees but will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the Noteholders from time to
time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Security Documents will secure, in
particular, a so called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent
rather than securing the claims of the Noteholders directly. The pledges governed by German law will therefore directly
secure, in particular, the parallel debt.

Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by
a debtor under, in particular, the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture, and any payment in respect of
the principal obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt
will discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel
debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount due under the Senior Secured Notes, there
are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under

282


-----

German law to secure such parallel debt. Although it is widely believed that a parallel debt can effectively be secured by
a pledge, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of a parallel debt structure and of the pledges
granted under German law to secure such parallel debt. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be
recognized by German courts and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the
ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable
of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent.

Moreover, the Security Agent does not hold the pledges or the parallel debt in trust. This means that in the case
of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may
successfully claim that there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Noteholders with respect to the secured
claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain
with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

**_Excessive Collateral_**

According to the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), collateral, and the
agreements granting such collateral, can be void if an initial over-collateralization (anfängliche Übersicherung) is
constituted which is so excessive that it must be considered as being “contra bonos mores” (gegen die guten Sitten). If, at
the time of entering into a security agreement, it is already certain that the realizable value of the collateral is significantly
out of proportion to the claim secured, the entire German collateral could be regarded as an initially excessive
collateralization. Although no specific case law exists, a decision by the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) indicates that the loan-to-collateral ratio would be beyond the threshold applied to subsequent
excessive collateralization if the value of the collateral is more than 150% of the amount of the secured obligations. Any
valuation, however, will be based on the realizable value taking into account any possible discount on the current market
value, arising, e.g., from a sale in the then current situation. In addition, the over-collateralization, in order to be regarded
as initially excessive, must be based on a creditor’s reprobate attitude (verwerfliche Gesinnung), which is assumed if a
creditor, out of self-interest, displays an ethically unbearable recklessness against a debtor. In exceptional circumstances,
an excessive loan-to-collateral ratio can, itself, justify the assumption of a reprobate attitude.

If the realizable value of the collateral at any date after having been granted not only temporarily exceeds the
amount of the secured claims by more than 10%, the subsequently excessively secured (nachträglich übersichert) creditor
is, according to the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), regularly obliged to release
collateral back to the debtor insofar as the estimated realizable value of collateral, which depends on the risks of realization
of the collateral and on the market situation, exceeds the secured claim amount by more than such 10%. In order to
determine the realizable value of the collateral granted, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) allows
for a reduction of the face value of the collateral, thus, permitting that the face value of the collateral is up to 150% of the
claim amounts secured from time to time. In case and to the extent that the realizable value of the aggregate collateral
exceeds 110% of the secured obligations, the secured creditor would, on demand by the collateral provider, have to release
excess collateral.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral_**

The German Guarantors guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes and providing Collateral are established in the
legal form of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) and a limited
partnership with a limited liability company as general partner (Kommanditgesellschaft, “GmbH & Co. KG”),
respectively. The granting of a Guarantee or Collateral by such German Guarantor in order to guarantee or secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company (each such German Guarantor, a “German Subsidiary
**Guarantor”) is subject to certain provisions relating to the preservation of the statutory capital under the German Limited**
Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”). These provisions
would also apply to any future guarantor or security grantor incorporated in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co.
KG.

As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders
to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s, or in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG its general partner’s, net assets (i.e., in
principle total assets less liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch) would fall below the amount of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative
amount of its net assets would further be reduced. The granting of a Guarantee or security interest by a German Subsidiary
Guarantor in respect of liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as payments under any
arrangements that are not at arm’s length terms may be considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG.

283


-----

In addition, Section 15b paragraph 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (“Section 15b InsO”)
(formerly section 64 GmbHG) prohibits the managing directors (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH to make payments to the
shareholders leading to the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the GmbH. Payments towards a guarantee as well as share
pledges and any other collateral granted by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent
or sister company may be considered payments to its shareholders in the meaning of Section 15b InsO (formerly section
64 GmbHG). This also applies to limited partnerships with a limited liability company as general partner such as a GmbH
& Co. KG.

In order to enable a German subsidiary incorporated in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG to grant
guarantees and to provide collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of
violating the provisions of the GmbHG and/or Section 15b InsO (formerly section 64 GmbHG) and to limit any potential
personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, security documents, indentures
and/or guarantees to contain so called “limitation language” in relation to such subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in
the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG.

Pursuant to such “limitation language,” the secured parties contractually agree, subject to certain exemptions, to
enforce the security interests and the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to demand payment under the guarantees against
a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable)
only if and to the extent that such enforcement and payment, respectively, do not result in the subsidiary’s or, in case of
a GmbH & Co. KG in the general partner’s, net assets falling below the amount of its registered share capital
(Stammkapital) or increasing such shortfall in order to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the GmbHG or with regard to Section 15b InsO (formerly section 64 GmbHG) - in the relevant German Subsidiary Guarantor becoming
illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) within the current or subsequent fiscal year and the managing director(s) of the German
Subsidiary Guarantor becoming liable pursuant to Section 15b InsO (formerly section 64 GmbHG).

Accordingly, the documentation with respect to the Collateral and the Guarantees, to the extent provided by a
German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will contain such contractual limitation language and such guarantees and
security interests are limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or
Collateral granted by such German Subsidiary Guarantor can only be enforced to a limited extent or not at all and the
Noteholders will lose the benefit of the Guarantees and Collateral, respectively.

German capital maintenance, liquidity protection rules and the other provisions referred to above are subject to
evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets
of German Subsidiary Guarantors, which can negatively affect (i) the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Senior
Secured Notes, (ii) the ability of a German Subsidiary Guarantor to make payments on the Guarantees or (iii) the ability
of the secured parties to enforce the Collateral.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder
deprives a German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be
applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Guarantees or Collateral granted by a German Subsidiary
Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.
Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may
be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the
debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other
business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the
Guarantees and/or Collateral by a German Subsidiary Guarantor.

Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction (for example, a Noteholder) qualifying as a repayment of the
registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Guarantees and the
Collateral, respectively, could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Court of
Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of
detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of “contra
bonos mores” (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any
circumstances indicating that a German Subsidiary Guarantor when granting the Guarantees and/or the Collateral was
close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such circumstances, the
Guarantees or the Collateral may also be invalid.

German law does not generally permit for the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence
of an enforcement event in relation to the pledge. The enforcement of a share/interest pledge governed by German law

284


-----

usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to
which certain waiting periods and notice requirements may apply.

Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent the right
to prevent other creditors of the relevant German Subsidiary Guarantor from foreclosing into and realizing the assets
constituting the Collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority
(according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds from such realization, but not an intervention right
(Drittwiderspruchsrecht) (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).
Accordingly, the Security Agent and the Noteholders may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other (unsecured) creditors
into the Collateral, even if they consider such foreclosure untimely. Moreover, enforcement of the Collateral through the
German courts may become time-barred or subject to defenses of setoff or counterclaim.

**England and Wales**

**_United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the EU_**

Following a national referendum in June 2016, the UK exercised its right pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on
the EU to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU and ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 at 11:00
p.m. (London time) (“Exit Day”). As a result, a reference in this Offering Memorandum to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on
Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”) as it applies to the UK is to be read, on or after Exit Day,
as a reference to such EU regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended) (the “EUWA”) and, as it may have been, or may from time to time be, amended,
modified or re-enacted by UK domestic law and shall include any subordinate legislation made from time to time under
the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the EUWA.

On Exit Day, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 at 11:00 p.m. (London
time) (“IP Day”). During this transition period, the UK continued to be treated as a Member State, including for the
purpose of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Following the transition period, the UK ceased to be treated as a Member
State.

The Recast Insolvency Regulation was amended with effect from IP Day pursuant to the Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended by the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, the
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and paragraph 1, schedule 5, European Union (Withdrawal
Agreement) Act 2020) (the “Insolvency Amendment Regulations”) such that the provisions regarding mutual
recognition of insolvency proceedings under the Recast Insolvency Regulation, providing for the automatic recognition
of insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, no longer apply. However, the EUWA provided for the Recast
Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main
proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the Recast Insolvency Regulation will not continue to
apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided that the main
proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in
Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings.

The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency
legislation which had direct effect in the United Kingdom. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that
apply under English law, the post-IP Day Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment
Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom in respect
of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt,
reorganization or liquidation and:

    - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the United Kingdom; or

    - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the United
Kingdom.

These tests are consistent with the Recast Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a
debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency
Amendment Regulations extend the English court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient
connection with England and Wales (and that (a) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit
to those applying for the winding-up order and (b) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the
company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be

285


-----

wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no
establishment in the United Kingdom; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a
Member State, into administration.

While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency
proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of
subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English
_insolvency and restructuring proceedings”)._

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under the laws
of England and Wales (each an “English company”). The courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company.

In addition, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency
Regulations”), which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) in the
United Kingdom and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world
without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings in respect of
an English company may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that
foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations
where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign
jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the United Kingdom, and
insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings
opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain.
Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory
liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement
of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a
creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English
court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit a stay may be requested from
the English court).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways.
These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for an
administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below)
granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of
liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving by special resolution
that it be wound up voluntarily.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, the Permitted Collateral Liens and certain perfection
requirements, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis, on the Issue Date, by
the Initial Collateral, and as soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and in any event within 10 days from the
Issue Date, by the Additional Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a
guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations
on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect
investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes
and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended, the “Insolvency Act”) and the onshored version of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation (which pursuant to the Insolvency Amendment Regulations has been substantially amended) provide that an
administrator may be appointed (whether in or out of court) in respect of a company incorporated in England and Wales
or Scotland, a company incorporated in an EEA state, a company not incorporated in an EEA state but with its COMI in
a Member State (other than Denmark), a company (wherever incorporated) having its COMI in the United Kingdom or a

286


-----

company (wherever incorporated) with its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the
United Kingdom.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration
order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to
become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of
administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall
due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its
liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section 123 of the Insolvency
Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory
demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court
order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or,
if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely
upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as
a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or
preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority
on Insolvency”).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of
a “qualifying floating charge” granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an
administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and,
subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration
(including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the proceeds
of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see
“—Priority on Insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to
a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the
administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed
charge holder. An administrator may also dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the consent of
the secured creditors.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the
appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the
company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a demand for
payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission
apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence)
against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining
any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An
interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not
yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an
intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry
of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating
charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors).

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to
realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue
of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge
over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims)
under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial
**Collateral Regulations”) (see further below).**

If an English company were to enter administration, whether it would be possible to enforce any security granted
by it while the company was in administration without permission of the court or consent of the administrator would
depend on whether such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made
under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection
therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

287


-----

Accordingly, if any of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration,
the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced (save to the extent
that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) while the relevant company was in administration
without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent
would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges_**

As set out above, the Insolvency Act empowers the English courts to make an administration order in respect of
an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its
directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and
different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. The Senior Secured Notes are not secured by a
floating charge.

In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the
floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of
English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge
must, unless the security document pre dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act
to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the
appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the
Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency
Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If
an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the
company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the
person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the
administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid
floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any
part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which
(a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver
within the meaning given by Section 29 of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating
charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole
or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying
floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their
own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the
property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect
of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the
whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a
question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be
charged to satisfy this test.

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be
required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of
unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and
20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such
cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s
net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in
which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured
creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge
realizations exceed £10,000, the court may grant an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis).
The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors.

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a
prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured
creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described
in the Financial Collateral Regulations 2003), as set out below.

288


-----

**_Fixed Charge Receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges, see “—Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges” above) may be appointed over some
or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge
or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925.

If appointed pursuant to the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge
(such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment
to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed
charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge that falls within the
definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs
his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy
whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable
care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a
statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also
have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted
from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see
“—Priority on Insolvency”).

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a)
an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and, where the floating
charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, use such cash, or use
cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which include the administrator’s remuneration and
can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business while in administration) in priority to the
claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have
priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets (provided the floating charge had not crystallized at the time
the fixed charge was granted and the fixed charge holder has no notice of any restrictions); (c) provided that the floating
charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, general costs and
expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the company’s
assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder;
(d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating
charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging
company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) floating charge security may be
subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (see “—Avoidance of Transactions—Grant of Floating
_Charge”); and (f) where the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral_
arrangement, floating charge security is (i) subject to the expenses of the insolvent estate, (ii) subject to the claims of
certain preferential creditors (such as employee, salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims,
certain unpaid pension contributions, and VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC) and (iii) as noted above, subject
to the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) for unsecured creditors; (g) an administrator may dispose of
or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court
approval but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets
subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed
charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator
applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional money required to be
added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realise
on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be
created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description
given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, amongst other
things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant
assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor

289


-----

is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the
consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a
floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could
be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in
insolvency proceedings.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (“CA06”), the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise or arrangement between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) in respect of the company’s obligations to those creditors. An
English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which
(a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could
also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has
been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance
documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an
English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an
existing or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial
obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations
of the existing obligors could be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances
so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied
in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing
rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in
connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number
representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote
in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents,
then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the court’s sanction order to the Registrar of
Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and
those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the
court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting
fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved by the creditors, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered
to the Registrar of Companies (in the case of UK companies, for the purpose of registration). A scheme of arrangement
can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third-parties in order
to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically
trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangement_**

English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of companies incorporated
in England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA State or with their respective COMI in the United Kingdom or a Member State
(other than Denmark).

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as
applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a
compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the
company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision
procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been
entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce
its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential
creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential
creditors, except with its consent.

290


-----

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by
value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted on in a company voluntary arrangement but a
secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary
arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. A CVA also requires the approval of
more than 50% in value of the company’s members present in person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution
to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the outcome of the meeting of members differs from the
outcome of the meeting of creditors, the decision of the creditors will prevail. Like creditors, members have the right to
apply to the court to challenge the approval of a company voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a
moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.

**_Filings_**

The prescribed particulars in respect of a security document under which an English company purports to create
security, together with a certified copy of the security document, should be delivered to the Registrar of Companies within
21 days after the date of creation of the security in accordance with Chapter A1 of Part 25 of CA06. While CA06 does
not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will
be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not
registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such
security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English
courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has
expired.

The application of the above Chapter to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral
Regulations. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out in
section 859A(6) of CA06): (i) a charge in favor of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection with the
lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its
obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of
section 859A of CA06 by or under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking
Act 2009).

Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of
a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities.

Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not
need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Registration with applicable asset registries may, however, still be
required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

**_Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the
legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including
guarantees and security).

**_Assignments_**

Any assignment of a debt or other chose in action, including by way of security, can only take effect as a legal
assignment under section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 if it meets the requirements of that provision, which are:
(i) the assignment must be in writing under the hand of the assignor; (ii) the assignment must be absolute and not
purporting to be by way of charge only; and (iii) notice of the assignment must be given to the underlying obligor. If any
of these requirements is not satisfied, the assignment may still constitute a valid equitable assignment. Equitable
assignments, including by way of security, are subject to certain limitations, including, without limitation: (i) where an
equitable interest is followed by a legal interest, the subsequent legal interest will take priority if the holder acquired it
for value without notice of the equitable interest; and (ii) the priority of dealings in most equitable interests is determined
by the time at which notice of such interest is given to the underlying obligor or to the person in control of that equitable
interest. The first to give notice will take priority, if that person does not have actual or constructive notice of the prior
interest and has given consideration for his or her interest.

291


-----

**_PSC Regime_**

Pursuant to Part 21A of CA06 (and related Schedules 1A and 1B to CA06), certain UK incorporated companies
and limited liability partnerships (for the purposes of this paragraph, each a relevant company) must keep a register of
certain registrable individuals and legal entities that have significant control over them. Failure of such registrable
individuals or legal entities or other persons specified in Part 21A of (and Schedule 1B to) the CA06 (for the purposes of
this paragraph, each a notifying party) to comply with the requirements of that Part may give relevant companies the right
to issue a restrictions notice to such notifying party for the purposes of Schedule 1B to CA06. Subject to certain
exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined
in Schedule 1B to CA06, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the
interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest
or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums
due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise. Such restrictions
could adversely affect the validity of the security interests over the ability of the Security Agent to enforce its rights under
the English security documents.

**_Liquidation/Winding-Up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed
by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency
Act (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed
from the Register of Companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court;
and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by
resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key difference between the two types
of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the
company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary
ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section
123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration)
is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control
by the creditors.

The English court has jurisdiction to wind up a company through compulsory liquidation if it is a company
registered in England and Wales, or if it is a foreign company (i) with its COMI in England and Wales, or (ii) with its
COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales, or (iii) in the case of an
unregistered foreign company, if (a) it has enough of a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the
English court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up through compulsory liquidation, (b) there is a reasonable
possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefits to those applying for the winding-up order and (c) one or more
persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the English court can exercise a
jurisdiction. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign
company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an Member State (except Denmark) but which has an
“establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation).

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a
compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property
made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to
any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect
in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by
the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition.

Once the winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be
imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although
there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order;
the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127
of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any
creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means
creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security).

292


-----

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business
of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents
in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates
any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a
liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective
liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However,
this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued
rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral
arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings.
Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is
entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one
of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and
distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes,
with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set
out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class
of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed
otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion
to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken
of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed
by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration.
Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has
given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford
the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that
it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise,
as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off
will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after
a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application
of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all
other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency
set-off applies).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is
less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the
possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which
they have a proprietary interest only;

    - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the
subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or
liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any
priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not
have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any
prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The
relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority
in which they are paid;

    - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority
in which expenses are paid); and

    - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

293


-----

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the
four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose
contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and
building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS up to the statutory limit. As between one another,
ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include:
(a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such claims exceed the
statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of
Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

    - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein)
only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors;

    - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would
include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which,
on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge;

    - Seventh ranking:

`o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured
creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security;

`o` secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable
contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8%
per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the
commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes or the
Guarantees, such interest due to the Noteholders may, if there are sufficient realizations from the
secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

`o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This,
however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling
dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and

    - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

See “—Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges” above for a description of the
Prescribed Part.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security
or guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if the company enters
administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) after the relevant act. Therefore,
if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge
the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company.
Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another
party who would then be entitled to pursue it.

_Onset of Insolvency_

294


-----

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date
on which (a) the court application for an administration order is made, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an
administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a
compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas
in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows
administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the
initial administration.

_Connected Persons_

A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges,
is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of the
relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner,
(b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil
partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with
a company if employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership, and of
the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person
has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other,
or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or
could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as
replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is
entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company
or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they
are to be taken as having control of the company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant
right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant
other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an
undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company
receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth,
than the consideration given by such company.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence
of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii)
if the security interest or the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate
that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a
connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent
and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings.

In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good
faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for
believing the transaction would benefit it.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as
it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could
include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees, although
there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order
by the court in relation to a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any
person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and

for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit
from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except
where the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant
right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant
other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a
surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company going
into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not
been entered into.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence
of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii)
if the security interest or guarantee was granted within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the
guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of
insolvency.

If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it
thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include
reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to the same principles
as are described above with respect to transactions at an undervalue). However, the court will only make such an order if
it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to
demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced
by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected
person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and that it
was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, and the connected person must demonstrate in such
proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption of
insolvency).

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above)
and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which that
person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An
application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator,
the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct
Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or
who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in
administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. The Insolvency Act also does not
prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the
time of or as a result of the transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect
the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the Senior Secured Notes
or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However,
such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company
in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a
benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum
unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transaction_

296


-----

An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply
to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted
by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made
(whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly
contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this
basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be
challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years
after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created
by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms
of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the
liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of
any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of
third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction
from the person who provided credit under it).

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company within the period of one
year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the
onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the English company
was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating charge will be invalid except
to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt
of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the
“Consideration”). The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the
floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person.

No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part
or in full) the relevant floating charge; any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid,
except to the extent of the value of the Consideration.

However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial
Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be invalidated on this basis.

As referred to above (see “—Fixed and Floating Charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterized
as a floating charge. If purported fixed charge security that is subsequently recharacterized has been granted within the
relevant suspect period referred to above, this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration
provided.

**_Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003_**

The “Financial Collateral Regulations” apply in respect of certain security interests granted over, and certain
title transfer arrangements in, “financial collateral” (together, “financial collateral arrangements”). Financial collateral
is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of
“financial instruments” includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under loans made
by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was to implement Directive
2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral arrangements (OJ 2002
L168/43) in the United Kingdom. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process of taking financial collateral
across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework.

If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations,
certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which (amongst other things) remove restrictions on
enforcing security, disapply certain provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors in administration or liquidation
and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For
example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a
registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that
would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations
enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial
collateral to which the security interest applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have

297


-----

become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate
in the relevant contract.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (the “CIGA 2020”) enacted fundamental
reforms to the UK’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been proposed in August
2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures
include (but are not limited to) the following:

(a) _Moratorium_

The CIGA 2020 introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide
companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options.

Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under
the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies
(including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market
arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the
life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company
that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary
arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside
the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets
exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a
company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a
company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time.

Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing
the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is
subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome
for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company
must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium.

Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the
company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner
appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in
the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue;
indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be
rescued as a going concern.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred
prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract
or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or
incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be
met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt
incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to
end the moratorium.

During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including
commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the
court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium
debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The CIGA 2020 includes a carve-out for enforcement of security
financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges,” “—
_Avoidance of Transactions—Grant of Floating Charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations_
_2003” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a_
moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor
may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed.

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a
company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any
unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official

298


-----

receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the
administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of
the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver).

Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s
activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without
the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the
rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of premoratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does
not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and
disposals of property outside the ordinary course.

A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on
which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the
company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court
confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements
with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium
debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged).
Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available:

    - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility
of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of
unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected
secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium
debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before
the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote;

    - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit;

    - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented,
accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and

    - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the
moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan).

(b) _Ipso Facto clauses prohibited_

The CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the
imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered
by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company
voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights
to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the
extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency
proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately
succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during
the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be
allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits
(where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts
and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this
new prohibition.

(c) _Restructuring plan_

The CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under CA06,
but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not
only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone
restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient
connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company
(including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will
propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed
to the company).

299


-----

Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely
to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going
concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating,
reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of
requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section
123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as
insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention.

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be
filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or
classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has
jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether
the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies.
Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to
participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic
interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the
court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned).
Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting.
However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure
must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or
members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every
stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company.

The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or
classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors
or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement,
there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is
made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts”
and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without
their consent.

Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan
requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a
plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby
“cramming-down” dissenting classes, if:

(i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring
plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e., what the court considers to be the most likely
alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and

(ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors
or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that
“relevant alternative” scenario.

A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor
of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the
case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette).

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the
office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pounds sterling at a single rate for each
currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the “relevant date” (generally
speaking, being the date on which the company entered administration or liquidation). This provision overrides any
agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration, Noteholders may be
subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount proved between the date on which such English obligor
goes into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such Noteholders may become
entitled. The English Supreme Court’s ruling in the Lehman Brothers case established that any such holder of the Senior

300


-----

Secured Notes would not be entitled to make a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of a fall in the value of
pounds sterling between the “relevant date” and the date of any distribution.

**_Foreign Laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or
other right against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to that security)
is located in any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English law, the validity, priority and
enforceability of that security may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third-Party Rights_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third-parties (including contracts and insurance
policies) may be subject to any rights of those third-parties.

**_Amendments_**

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or
other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without
further reference to the guarantor or surety.

**_Security over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English obligor or over shares of the English obligor are typically, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance
over the property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable
charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may
additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured
parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company
statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or security by an English company in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective
company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the
risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights
unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with an English company in good faith;
however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be
established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of CA06
provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the
success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where
there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a
transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of CA06 additionally provides that, in certain
circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory
provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the Supreme Court has recently held that it takes place when the
company in question is insolvent or bordering on insolvency, or when an insolvent liquidation or administration is
probable.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent
they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General Position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments
and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant
jurisdictions.

301


-----

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which was implemented in the United Kingdom
via the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency
proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined
to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the
debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and
scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the
jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of
foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where
the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor
has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are not
regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in
civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements
2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s
pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under
principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area
of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to
the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and
the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related
exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter position).

_Recognition in the European Union_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK proceedings no longer
benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in Member States. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between
the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency
procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving
the UK and one or more Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for
UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and for UK office holders to effectively
deal with assets located in Member States. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on
the private international law rules adopted in the relevant Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel
proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office
holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such
appointment will be recognized in other Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the
remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States
may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a Member State. It is not
possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be
adversely affected as a result.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from
the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. The sale will be made pursuant to a Purchase
Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between, inter alios, the Issuer, the Guarantors and Citigroup Global Markets
Europe AG, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE and KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, as representatives of the Initial
Purchasers. The Initial Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes are Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG, Goldman Sachs
Bank Europe SE, KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Senior Secured Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial
Purchasers will purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them
are purchased.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of
the Senior Secured Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes to purchasers at the price to investors indicated
on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Senior Secured Notes, the Initial
Purchasers may from time to time vary the offering price and other selling terms without notice. To the extent that any of
the Initial Purchasers are not U.S.-registered broker dealers, they will only offer and sell the Senior Secured Notes in the
United States through U.S.-registered broker dealers or affiliates, as appropriate. In addition, the Initial Purchasers may
offer and sell the Senior Secured Notes outside the U.S. through certain of their affiliates.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments which the Initial Purchasers may be required to
make in respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain expenses
of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has made certain representations and
given certain warranties in respect of its legal and financial matters. The Initial Purchasers are entitled, under certain
circumstances, to terminate the Purchase Agreement. In such event, no Senior Secured Notes will be delivered to
investors. The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to
sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors that have a tenor of more than one year (other than the Senior Secured Notes) during the
period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 60 days after the date of the
Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public
offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering
Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that
purpose is required. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with
the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or
jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum
comes are advised to inform themselves about, and to observe, any restrictions relating to the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resales of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

The Senior Secured Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has been
advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes but are
not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to
the liquidity of the trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in_
_which case an investor’s ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes may be limited.”_

The Stabilization Manager may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering transactions in
accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size,
which creates a short position for the Stabilization Manager. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the
underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve

303


-----

purchases of the Senior Secured Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short
positions.

The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Senior Secured Notes. These
stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Senior Secured Notes to be higher than it
would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Senior Secured Notes in the
open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created
by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Stabilization Manager of a greater number of Senior Secured Notes than
they are required to purchase in the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids
or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Senior Secured Notes
while the offering of the Senior Secured Notes is in progress.

These activities by the Stabilization Manager, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own
accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Senior Secured Notes. As a result, the price
of the Senior Secured Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities
are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in
the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Persons who purchase Senior Secured Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,
taxes, and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering
price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any
applicable securities laws of any state or territory of the United States. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior
Secured Notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state
securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Initial Purchasers will not offer or sell the
notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and sales to nonU.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days after
the later of the commencement of this Offering and the Issue Date, an offer or sale of the Senior Secured Notes (including
the Guarantees) within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Senior Secured Notes will be
deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.”

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions
of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR or (iii)
not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information
document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling or distributing the Senior Secured Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering,
selling or distributing the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis
that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Senior Secured Notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Senior
Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Senior Secured Notes (an “EEA Distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, an EEA Distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Senior Secured Notes (a “UK Distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a UK Distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product
Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
(by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section
21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Senior Secured Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors;

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by
it in relation to the Senior Secured Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and

    - any Senior Secured Notes will only be offered in the Netherlands to qualified investors (as defined in the
Prospectus Directive), unless such offer is made in accordance with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act
(Wet op het financieel toezicht).

Any offer or sale in the U.S. will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker-dealers registered
under the U.S. Exchange Act.

We expect that delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made to investors against payment on the Senior
Secured Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will
be        business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”)) following the date of pricing of the Senior Secured Notes (this settlement
cycle is being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in one business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the
next successive business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Senior Secured Notes will initially
settle         business days following the date of this Offering Memorandum, to specify an alternative settlement cycle
at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes who wish to make such
trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective
affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment
banking services for the Issuer and its affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may have a lending relationship with us, including under the Senior
Credit Facilities, and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. In
addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold Senior Dollar Notes or Senior Euro Notes,
which are subject to the redemption described under “Summary—Transactions.” To the extent the Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates hold any Senior Dollar Notes or Senior Euro Notes, they may receive payment in connection
with the redemption of the Senior Dollar Notes or the Senior Euro Notes.

Funds advised by KKR that indirectly own an equity interest in the Issuer are affiliates of KKR Capital Markets
(Ireland) Limited, which is acting as an Initial Purchaser in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes.
KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited may therefore be deemed to be our affiliate and have a conflict of interest with
us.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and
securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their

305


-----

customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by
entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in
our securities, including potentially the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also
make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such
securities and instruments.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, sale, pledge or other transfer of any
of the Senior Secured Notes or Guarantees offered hereby.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees (the “Securities”) have not been, and will not be, registered under
the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold within the United
States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the
Senior Secured Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and re-sale only to
QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and to persons who are not U.S. persons and
who are outside the United States in an offshore transaction in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
(“Regulation S”). As used in this section, the terms “United States,” “U.S. person” and “offshore transaction” have the
meanings given to them in Regulation S.

In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the Issue Date, an offer or sale
of the Senior Secured Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A
or another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

Each purchaser of the Senior Secured Notes (other than the Initial Purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be
deemed to have acknowledged, warranted, represented to and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor, and the Initial
Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been and
will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable state securities law or the
securities laws of any other applicable jurisdiction; and that the Senior Secured Notes are being offered
for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities
law or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S; and, unless
so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any applicable state securities law or other
applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto
and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (iv) and (v) below.

(2) It acknowledges that this Offering Memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration
under the U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and may not comply in important
respects with SEC rules that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering of
securities.

(3) It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) of the Issuer or any
Guarantor or acting on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor and it is either:

(a) a QIB and is aware that any sale of the Senior Secured Notes to it will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A and the acquisition of the Senior Secured Notes will be for its own account or for
the account of another QIB; or

(b) not a U.S. person, nor is it purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S. person (other than a
distributor (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S)), and is purchasing the Senior Secured
Notes outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S and
is not a retail investor.

(4) It acknowledges that neither the Issuer, the Guarantors nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, has made any representation to it with
respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries or the Offering or sale of any Senior Secured Notes, other than
the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial
Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the appropriateness, accuracy, adequacy or
completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. It also acknowledges that it
has had access to such financial and other information concerning the Company, the Issuer and the
Senior Secured Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the

307


-----

Senior Secured Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the
Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.

(5) It is purchasing the Senior Secured Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which it exercises sole investment discretion and is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for
investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in
violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any applicable state or other securities laws, subject to any
requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or
accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available
under the U.S. Securities Act.

(6) It agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Senior
Secured Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Senior Secured Notes (including the Guarantees), by
its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, not to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Senior
Secured Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is, in the case of
Senior Secured Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A, one year after the later of the Issue Date, the issue
date of any additional Senior Secured Notes and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates
was the owner of such Senior Secured Notes (or any predecessor thereof), or is, in the case of Senior
Secured Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S, 40 days after the later of the Issue Date, the issue date
of any additional Senior Secured Notes, and the date on which such Senior Secured Notes (or any
predecessor thereof) were first offered to persons other than Distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of
Regulation S), except (a) to the Issuer, the Guarantors or any subsidiaries thereof, (b) pursuant to a
registration statement that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (c) for so long as
the Senior Secured Notes are eligible pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it reasonably believes to be a
QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the
transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to an offshore transaction to persons who
are not U.S. persons and who are outside the United States within the meaning of and in reliance on
Regulation S or (e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition
of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their
control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any applicable local laws and
regulations, and further subject to the Issuer’s and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or
transfer (1) pursuant to clauses (d) or (e) prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date to require the
delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them,
(2) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the
reverse of the Senior Secured Note is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Trustee and (3)
agrees that it will give to each person to whom the Senior Secured Note is transferred a notice
substantially to the effect of this legend.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Global Note will contain a legend substantially to the following
effect:

(7) If the purchaser purchases the Senior Secured Notes, it will also be deemed to acknowledge that the
foregoing restrictions apply to holders of beneficial interests in these Senior Secured Notes as well as
to the Noteholders.

(8) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Senior Secured Notes notice of any
restrictions on transfer of such Senior Secured Notes.

(9) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent and Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of
transfer any Senior Secured Notes except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Issuer and
the Transfer Agent and Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with.

(10) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy
of the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any
of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by
its purchase of the Senior Secured Notes are no longer accurate, it will promptly notify the Initial

and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and

Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Senior Secured Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to
the Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set
forth under “Plan of Distribution” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

(12) It understands that, in the event additional Senior Secured Notes are issued pursuant to Regulation S
that bear the same ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification number as the initial Senior
Secured Notes previously issued, without being fungible with the initial Senior Secured Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (including in respect
of investors that hold book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on or prior to the date of
issuance of such additional Senior Secured Notes) will not be eligible for transfer to book-entry interests
in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any).

(13) It represents that it understands that the Issuer shall not recognize any offer, sale, pledge or other transfer
of the Senior Secured Notes other than in compliance with the above-stated restrictions.

(14) It represents and agrees that either (i) it is not, and is not holding Senior Secured Notes or any interest
therein on behalf of any Plan or (ii) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Senior Secured Note
and any interest therein will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

(15) It acknowledges that any purported acquisition or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes or beneficial
interest therein to an acquirer or transferee that does not comply with the requirements of the above

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

Each purchaser of the Senior Secured Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this
Offering Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to this Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving
this Offering Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to the Offering Memorandum acknowledges
that:

(1) such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us, and to review and has received, all

additional information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the
information herein;

(2) such person has not relied on the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with the Initial Purchasers

in connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and

(3) except as provided pursuant to paragraph (i) above, no person has been authorized to give any

information or to make any representation concerning the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees
offered hereby other than those contained herein and, if given or made, such other information or
representation should not be relied upon as having been authorized by us or the Initial Purchasers.

For so long as any of the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the
meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the U.S. Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, nor exempt from the reporting
requirements under Rule 12g3-2(b) of the U.S. Exchange Act, provide to the holder or beneficial owner of such restricted
securities or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted securities designated by such holder or beneficial owner, in
each case upon the written request of such holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser, the information required to
be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act to permit compliance with Rule 144A thereunder in

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a Dutch company. The Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of the Netherlands, the
United States, Germany and England and Wales. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture, to accept service of process in the United States through agents designated for such purpose,
it may not be possible for Noteholders to (i) effect service of process upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective
directors or officers or (ii) enforce judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability of such
entities or persons under the U.S. federal securities laws and state securities laws or other laws against any such entities
or persons in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction.

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in the
Netherlands. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in the Netherlands,
either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment
for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would
not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim
must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same
judgment without substantive re-examination or re-litigation on the merits if (a) the foreign court rendering that judgment
has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance
with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the
Netherlands, (c) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same
parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and
between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (d) the foreign
judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin—final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been
exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body have been exhausted and no other
remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal
or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful
whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the
Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be
subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed
in euros at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of
the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay
proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the
extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.

**Germany**

Civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the Unites States may, either in an original action or
in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts, not be enforceable in Germany. The United States and Germany
currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration
awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, under applicable legal rules, a final judgment for payment given
by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be
enforceable in Germany.

A final judgement by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter
decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgements if any of the reasons for excluding
enforceability set forth in Sections 723(2), 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) exist:

314


-----

    - the judgment is not final under U.S. law; or

    - U.S. courts would not have had jurisdiction over the case based on the principles on jurisdictional
competences under German law; or

    - the defendant did not appear in the proceedings and invokes such lack of appearance, and the document
introducing the proceedings was not duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for
adequate defense; or

    - the judgment conflicts with (i) any prior judgment rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment
rendered by another foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; or

    - the proceedings resulting in the judgment to be recognized are irreconcilable with previously pending
proceedings in a German court; or

    - the recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court would be in conflict with German public policy, including
the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by
virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); or

    - reciprocity is not guaranteed (i.e., the courts of the country where the judgement was issued would not
recognize and enforce a comparable judgement by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities, such as the Noteholders, may be able to enforce judgments in
Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to
enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In particular,
the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law.
Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or
moratorium, as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

It should be noted that German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages as
incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual
losses or damages.

It is uncertain whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. However, if an original action is brought before a German court, and
the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also
certain substantive provisions of the EU and the German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S.
federal and state law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German
public policy. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. As far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law
provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may compel the extensive production of
documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses prior to trial. Evidence obtained in this manner may
be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor a final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new suit in the same matter in a competent
court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under
such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only
as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the
dispute and may render a judgment inconsistent with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United
States, but the latitude to deviate from the foreign judgment is limited. The German court is free to issue a completely
new decision if there are grounds for non-recognition under 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, but must
otherwise take the foreign decision into account, i.e., the foreign judgement has a certain binding effect.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In

315


-----

order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent
jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original
matter decided by the U.S. court and/or enforce a judgment, provided that (subject to what is described below) and it
would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that the defense to it has no real
prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason for trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment
by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original
proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in
respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to
penal, revenue or other public law.

An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that:

    - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy;

    - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of
the Act;

    - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial
justice;

    - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court
whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court;

    - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or

    - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the
dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a U.S. court (to whose jurisdiction
the judgment debtor did not submit).

Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained
from U.S. federal or state courts in civil and commercial matters. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you
that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the
United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.
