Please see “Summary— _Summary Historical and Other Financial Information.” As used in this Offering Memorandum, our key non-IFRS_ financial measures include: - Organic net sales growth/(decrease): Organic net sales growth/(decrease) presents a “like-for-like” comparative growth rate, and represents the change in net sales for the current period compared to the prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis and by eliminating any change in scope between the relevant periods. Such change in scope between periods may result from: (i) an acquisition, divestiture or disposal of our business in a country or a major market or that of a business unit; (ii) changes to the business model under which we operate in a specific market, or with respect to the manner in which a particular product is (or particular products are) sold by us in that market (for example, if we change our local operating model from a distributor model to a royalty model, or if we change from thirdparty manufacturing (wherein such third-party manufacturer typically sources raw materials) to toll manufacturing (wherein we typically supply raw materials to a third party manufacturer) or (iii) the adoption of an accounting standard or a change in the application of an accounting principle, if applicable. We commenced calculating organic net sales growth/(decrease) beginning for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we present organic net sales growth/(decrease) for the year ended December 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 only. The constant currency exchange rate is calculated using the measures described below under “— _Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures.”_ - Constant currency net sales growth: Represents the change in net sales for the relevant period compared to the prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis (as described under “— _Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures”). We present constant currency net sales growth for_ the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 only. We commenced calculating organic net sales growth/(decrease) beginning for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our management believes that the foregoing non-IFRS financial measures are helpful indicators of the underlying performance or liquidity of the business. Management believes that the foregoing non-IFRS financial measures are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and, because these measures are used by management to track business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions. In addition, these measures are commonly used by investors, security analysts and other interested parties in our industry as supplemental measures of operating performance or liquidity. Although we present these measures to enhance the understanding of our historical operating performance, they should not be considered alternatives to operating profit as an indicator of operating performance or profitability, or alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity. You should not consider organic net sales growth/(decrease), constant currency net sales growth, constant currency gross profit (decrease)/growth, constant currency gross margin (decrease)/growth, Normalized EBITDA, Normalized EBIT, constant currency Normalized EBITDA growth, normalized free cash flow, normalized free cash conversion ratio, normalized EBITDA margin, constant currency normalized EBITDA margin (decrease)/growth, pricing contribution, volume/mix contribution, underlying volume/mix contribution, historical leverage ratio or any other non-IFRS measures presented herein as alternatives to measures of financial performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such as gross profit or xii ----- operating profit, as a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of liquidity. These metrics, which we believe are helpful indicators of the underlying performance or liquidity of the business, are not measures of financial performance under IFRS. In addition, the Company’s computation of Normalized EBITDA, Normalized EBIT and other non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures or ratios used by other companies. In particular, Normalized EBITDA and Normalized EBIT have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider any of them in isolation. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs, (ii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt and (iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future, and these metrics do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements, or other future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments. Such measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have not been audited or reviewed by our auditors nor prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of consolidated financial information in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC which would apply if the offering of the Senior Secured Notes was being registered with the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of the consolidated financial information included herein.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Our journey took more than four years, with the wholescale transformational part of our journey completed in 2022. To become an independent business, we focused on separating and stabilizing our business, simplifying, renovating and innovating our product portfolio, expanding into new product categories, investing in R&D through the opening of a new Food Science Centre, optimizing our supply chain, building an end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform and building a new IT infrastructure. See “Business—History” for a detailed description of our transformation journey. Building on our existing strong foundations and as a result of the significant industrial, digital and cultural transformation undertaken since 2018, we believe we are well positioned to advance the future of food. 1 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Backed by a rich heritage and a global scale, we are highly differentiated in the plant-based sector. Our reinvigorated iconic power brands reflect over 150 years of product expertise and brand heritage and are trusted by consumers globally. Our scale, culture and capabilities, including extensive food technology and innovation expertise, our community of dedicated “Upfielders,” consisting of our management team and employees, and our 14 manufacturing facilities across five continents, provide a strong value proposition for our customers and consumers, and ensure we are well positioned to advance the future of food. Our products are marketed under a family of historic and iconic brands with strong recognition in their target markets. Our products are made with natural and sustainably sourced ingredients. Our carefully selected ingredients come from a diversified supply chain to minimize risk and environmental impact and maximize taste, functionality, health, affordability and sustainability for our consumers. Our operations are diversified across three regions, namely Europe, the Americas and AMEA. We hold leadership positions in the global butter and spreads, and plant cheese segments, with leadership positions in creams in Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets. We sell our products across these regions primarily through retail channels, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and other outlets. In addition, through our professional foodservice channel, we sell our products to commercial outlets, such as quick service restaurants, bakeries, pizza and pasta outlets, hotels, catering and industrial kitchens, and to the social sector, such as educational institutions, workplaces and hospitals. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, our net sales were €2,793 million, €3,375 million and €3,275 million, respectively. During the same periods, our operating profit was €288 million, €453 million and €570 million, and our Normalized EBITDA was €666 million, €749 million and €831 million, respectively. During the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our net sales were €3,209 million, our operating profit was €604 million and Normalized EBITDA was €862 million.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.1,We are well positioned to advance the Future of Food in a large and growing TAM,"We believe that the future of food lies in tasty, high-quality, responsibly made, plant-based food. Transforming the food system by increasing the consumption of plant-based foods in our diets is the key to address the impact of what we eat on climate, nature and health. As a global leader in plant-based food, offering our products in four large and growing categories and selling into over 100 countries worldwide, we are well positioned to advance the future of food and to meet the growing shift in consumer preferences to plant-based eating. To inspire more people to eat plant-based alternatives, we focus on delivering tasty, high performing, healthy, sustainable and affordable products. We believe that there should be no compromise for consumers when they change to plant-based products as compared to dairy alternatives. We benefit from a senior management team with significant experience in the consumer-packaged goods industry. A majority of our current senior management team has been with us since our acquisition by KKR in 2018, and has been critical in our successful transformation. Under their leadership, we have separated, transformed and reinvented our business as a global leader in plant-based food and strongly positioned our business to drive conversion to plant-based alternatives. We believe that our senior management team has also been instrumental in developing a strong and motivated organization with a purpose- and performance-driven culture, which is carried by a passionate and engaged community of “Upfielders.” We believe that our community of “Upfielders” are aligned with our purpose, and are highly motivated to make an impact, deliver sustainable, purposeful long-term growth and advance the transition to a plant-based food future. Our ability to advance the future of food is further strengthened by our portfolio of Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses products, sold through our reinvigorated and iconic brands, our global scale and manufacturing footprint, our food technology and innovation expertise which together provide a strong value proposition for our customers and consumers. We offer these plant-based products in our four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses, which provide us access to a large and growing TAM (across both dairy and non-dairy) of approximately €151 billion as of 2022, which is 15 times larger than our TAM of approximately €11 billion in 2017 under our previous ownership (which was focused on plant-based spreads (margarines)). Our expansion into the Butter, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses categories, in addition to Spreads, resulted in an expansion of our TAM. While currently the penetration of plant-based products in the Butters, Creams and Cheeses categories is low, and estimated at less than 1%, there is a potential opportunity of approximately €23 billion (based on an incremental €7 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 5% plant-based penetration) or €38 billion (based on an incremental €22 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 16% plant-based penetration) (see also “Industry—Upfield’s TAM”). We believe that our global footprint and renovated and innovative product portfolio provide a significant growth opportunity in our TAM. Within our TAM (which covers both dairy and non-dairy products), given the growing consumer preference for plant-based diets in the backdrop of environmental, sustainability and health concerns, there is potential for increased rate of conversion to plant-based products, which we are well positioned to leverage, especially given our strong position globally and in the key markets in which we operate. For instance, according to NielsenIQ measurement data, within our Plant Butter and Spreads core category, which contributed 81% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are the largest producer globally in terms of market share and hold leading positions across some of the largest butter and spreads markets globally, including North America, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, according to NielsenIQ measurement data, we are the global leader in the plant cheese segment, and have leadership positions in creams in Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.2,A reinvigorated portfolio of brands reshaping the future of food,"With our portfolio of trusted brands we believe we can drive conversion to plant-based food and leverage our strong market positions going forward. Our brand platforms are led by our power brands, our most iconic brands, which have a long history and heritage. We believe that our power brands are deeply rooted and trusted by our consumers and customers across a number of our markets and have high brand awareness in their respective markets. These brands include, for example, Flora (launched in 1964), Country Crock (launched in 1954), Becel +ProActiv (Becel launched in 1962 and ProActiv launched in 2000), Rama (launched in 1924), BlueBand (launched in 1916) and Violife (acquired in 2020). In addition to our power brands, we also have a number of country or region specific brands with a strong local heritage and brand awareness, such as Lätta in Sweden, Stork in the United Kingdom and Tulipan in Spain. 2 ----- Following our acquisition by KKR, we have also reorganized and reinvigorated our brand portfolio since 2018. We refreshed our brands around our end-to-end brand platforms, so as to provide for better harmonization and efficiencies across our R&D and innovation pipeline, sales and marketing and supply chain activities. Our brand platforms are founded upon key prerequisites of taste and affordability, but each platform serves a distinct consumer need and is mapped against the key usage occasions and growth opportunities across our categories and markets. We also organize our brands across three different price tiers: “good,” (targeting price sensitive customers) “better” (targeting customers looking for additional product benefits at a more affordable price than a dairy alternative) and “best” (targeting customers seeking premium products with multiple features, such as lowering cholesterol). We assign our brands and products across these tiers which are each designed to meet distinct consumer needs and cater for certain price sensitivities, thereby catering to various social demographic needs. We believe that such categorization simplifies consumer decision-making and helps us strategically position each tier to appeal to a different array of consumers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.3,Well-invested end-to-end platform,"We operate an end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform, in which we have made significant investment in recent years, and through which we produce and sell our products to retail and foodservice partners in over 100 countries globally. We operate a global network of manufacturing facilities and regional cold chain distribution centers with capabilities to support growth. Our historic strong cash generation has enabled us to invest significantly in our global operations, ensuring we have the latest manufacturing innovations at our disposal. We own a total of 14 manufacturing facilities, comprising seven in Europe, four in the Americas and three in AMEA. These facilities produced approximately 91% of our total production volume for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our comprehensive manufacturing network with a globally scaled and digitally-enabled supply chain, is well positioned for future growth. Our end-to-end platform is supported by our general ERP system and our SAP4Hana ERP system, which enable us to make data-driven operational decisions. Our robust in-house manufacturing capabilities allow for complete control and flexibility in the manufacturing process, through which we can (i) maintain a closer level of control over our robust quality and safety standards, (ii) better establish and control cost savings, (iii) limit and control manufacturing disruptions, (iv) reduce our carbon footprint and (v) manage the manufacturing process more efficiently. Our products and customers further benefit from our internal centralized procurement function designed to leverage our purchasing expertise and maximize scale efficiencies across the regions where we operate.

That pipeline is driven by our investment in R&D, oils & fats and plant-based proteins amongst other enabling technologies, with food science at its core. We believe that we have an industry leading R&D expertise that enables us to produce new and innovative products using key ingredient know-how, technically sophisticated equipment and processes across our core categories and products. As an insights-driven organization we seek to continually enhance consumer experience with respect to taste, functionality, health and nutrition, sustainability and affordability by developing relevant product and packaging innovation. We continuously invest in food innovation and food technology expertise from our new state-of-the-art food science centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands (“Food Science Centre”), which we have developed with an investment capital of approximately €38 million. Our Food Science Centre focuses on plant-based food innovation and it aims to pioneer the development of plant-based foods, enabling technologies including oils and fats as well as proteins, and sustainable packaging solutions. Our team of more than 150 food scientists, food and packaging technologists and specialists focus on the development of plant-based foods and sustainable packaging solutions. We are also a leading filer of plant-based patents, and hold 656 patents and patent applications. In 2023, we applied for a further ten patents across our categories and core technologies. With our deep expertise in plant-based and natural ingredients and proprietary knowledge of plant-based food manufacturing, we have implemented a significant product portfolio overhaul since 2018, focused on taste, 3 ----- clean label and naturalness, where possible. For instance, we developed our first-generation Plant Butter product between 2018 and 2020, which we have since then further evolved, offering products we aim to achieve taste parity as compared to dairy butter. We have also developed new recipes and ingredients for our products, for example to provide consumers with palm oil-free options through our patented technology. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand, with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in early 2024. Our R&D and innovation roadmap is centered on continuous improvement and innovation within our core categories, to attract more and more consumers and broaden the appeal of our products. Key areas of focus include further improving our Plant Cheese product range, in particular in cold applications to further improve our Plant Cheese offering and applying some of our developing technology to further improve our Plant Butters and Plant Creams products. In addition, we continue to develop our packaging technology to create sustainable packaging and achieve our goal to reduce the environmental impact of our packaging through reduced plastic usage and increased recyclability of our packaging. As well as innovating internally to achieve these goals, we partner with academia, established ingredients and packaging players, startups and scale-ups whose differentiated propositions we believe can complement our R&D capabilities and our ability to scale through our distribution channels, platform and growth levers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.5,"Growth levers underpinned by a resilient, attractive financial profile with high cash generation","Our growth levers are centered around driving conversion from dairy products to our plant-based products and involve: - Creating the best-ever products made by us: delivering tastier, high-quality products with natural ingredients in our four core categories, underpinned by a strong innovation pipeline; - Deploying our power brands: leveraging our iconic power brands, recognized and trusted across markets, with clear propositions; - Executing in multiple channels: reaching as many people as possible by executing well within our channels: retail and foodservice; and - Driving and leveraging our scale: leveraging our digitally enabled end-to-end platform and scale. Our transformation journey since 2018 has taken place against a turbulent and volatile backdrop of events including a global pandemic, associated supply chain challenges, commodity inflation and the ongoing cost-ofliving crisis. However, during this period, by leveraging our growth levers, we have demonstrated a track record of stable financial performance, in particular delivered strong growth in organic net sales, gross profit and Normalized EBITDA. Between the year ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our reported net sales increased at a CAGR of 6.4%, our gross profit increased at a CAGR of 11.4% and our Normalized EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 12.1%. We have also demonstrated strong cash generation, and generated a normalized free cash flow and normalized free cash conversion ratio of €702 million and 81.4%, respectively, in each case, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe this compares favorably with our peers and is supported by, among other things: - our flexible cost base, which allows for a sustainable gross margin. We have clear, consistent and well-established supply chain, and hedging policies with respect to our major inputs and foreign exchange exposures, which has allowed us to maintain strong levels of profitability in periods of fluctuations and under high inflationary conditions; - our sustained profitability, with a Normalized EBITDA margin of 23.8%, 22.2%, 25.4% and 26.9%, in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, largely attributable to our flexible cost structure, our powerful brands, our revenue growth management capabilities and our track record of operational cost savings; - a favorable working capital position, as we benefit from a negative cash conversion cycle. This largely is a structural feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and finished product markets in which we operate and our operational efficiency with respect to our inventory management; and 4 ----- - our comprehensive manufacturing network with a globally scaled and digitally-enabled supply chain and significant spare capacity. This allows for increased net sales volumes without incremental capital expenditure resulting in strong cash generation. Our strong cash generation and resulting Normalized EBITDA growth has helped us to progressively deleverage. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our historical leverage ratio was 8.4x, 7.2x, 6.5x and 6.5x, respectively. Our historical leverage ratio represents the ratio of our (i) net debt, which is defined as our financial liabilities gross of unamortized financing fees less cash and cash equivalents, excluding lease liabilities and derivative financial instruments to (ii) Normalized EBITDA.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategies,9.3.1,Our growth levers,"_Creating the best-ever products made by us: delivering tastier, high-quality products with natural ingredients in our four core categories, underpinned by a strong innovation pipeline_ Since 2018, we have reinvented our product portfolio, investing significant resources to create the bestever products made by us, including by harmonizing and simplifying our ingredients list and moving towards fewer, natural and fully plant-based ingredients. We are focused on delivering our best-ever products that are designed to have the same or superior taste, versatility and performance (cooking, baking, and spreading) as dairy products. We believe that there should be no compromise for consumers when they change to a plant-based butter or spread, liquid, plant-based cream or plant-based cheese, as compared to dairy alternatives. For example, our Plant Butter is specifically formulated with the aim to match the performance and taste of dairy butter. Based on more than 50 taste profiles, we created a series of plant butters which we strive to taste and perform just like dairy butter and that match the specific taste preferences of different consumer profiles in key markets. Also, our knowhow and expertise of natural ingredients has enabled us to simplify our Plant Butter to contain just six or seven natural ingredients (including certain Plant Oils, water, plant protein and, in some cases, salt) and enable consumers to swap it directly for dairy butter in any recipe. Consumers are also increasingly focused on clean label and naturalness, and 99% of all our ingredients by volume are natural in origin. We continue to invest in R&D to deliver products using recipes made from natural ingredients or products that are free from artificial colors, flavors and preservatives, and without compromising on food safety, quality and performance. In addition, as part of our commitment to be 100% plant-based by the end of 2030, we are continuously reviewing our use of dairy ingredients where there is no compromise in taste or performance. Aside from taste and performance, we focus on the nutritional benefits of our products, as well as their positive contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and a key reason why people choose our products. In 2022, our team of nutritionists and product developers created the Upfield nutritional benchmarking program, based on what science tells us is required for each different product proposition and which introduced saturated fat and trans-fat targets for plant creams and plant cheeses. This helps us ensure that we meet nutritional targets in our products and are aligned with international dietary guidelines and regulations. Our plant-based products contain zero trans-fats and lower saturated fats compared to dairy alternatives. So, whether consumers are looking for a product to bake a cake, help lower their cholesterol or containing the nutrients to support a growing family, our products strive to provide a “no compromise” choice, that is better for consumers and better for the planet. _Deploying our power brands: leveraging our iconic power brands, recognized, trusted and loved over the world with clear propositions_ Our business traces its origin and heritage back over 150 years and, as a result, many of our reinvigorated iconic power brands, including BlueBand and Rama, have a brand heritage spanning over 100 years. Our power 5 ----- brands, including as an example, Flora, Country Crock, Becel +ProActiv, Rama, BlueBand and Violife, are trusted in their key markets globally and are at the heart of our future growth strategy and success. Our power brands are well-known and have a high brand awareness amongst consumers in our markets. They represent the platform from which we have successfully launched our product innovations and portfolio renovation. Through our power brands we engage with both loyal and new consumers, offering people a positive choice, both as a plant-based alternative to dairy and also for less competitive brands and private label. Based on independent brand research, many of our power brands are among the best-performing FMCG/packaged grocery brands across our key markets in terms of brand awareness. We believe that the high score of our power brands indicate that consumers are more likely to choose our brands over others, which is a strong indicator of increasing brand influence and share. To further support our power brands, we complemented the ongoing innovation across our portfolio with an increase in strategic advertising and promotion investment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our advertising and promotion expenses amounted to €173 million (equalling 5.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 and an increase of 22.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022). For example, in 2023, we launched our “Skip the Cow” campaign aimed at informing and driving consumers towards more plant-based products. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign pushed the uptake of Flora Plant and has proved to be a valuable resource in boosting consumer awareness of our Plant Butter offering and also contributed to a strong positive consumer net sentiment of 86% towards our overall Flora brand. Furthermore, following the “Skip the Cow” campaign, Flora Plant Butter experienced growth in household penetration and share of segment in the United Kingdom. Following the success of the “Skip the Cow” campaign in the United Kingdom, we launched similar campaigns across European markets, such as Germany and Austria, and intend to also roll it out to other key markets such as the Netherlands, Poland or Spain, and also across other brands. To further leverage the strength of our brands, we have from time to time considered, and continue to consider and evaluate, modifications to our corporate branding and identity to more closely align with our key brands. _Executing in multiple channels: reaching as many people as possible through our channels: retail and foodservice_ We also differentiate ourselves through our retail and professional foodservice channels, which enable us to reach consumers directly through both industry channels. We sell our products to retail outlets, including to many of the world’s largest retailers, as well as to wholesalers. We also enhanced our e-commerce capabilities by developing relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco, Amazon and Carrefour online, which have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe represent a significant growth opportunity in the regions in which we operate, especially in Europe and the Americas. In addition, in emerging markets in which we operate across our regions, we have established a strong market channel based on deep relationships with well-known and reputable distributors. Through our foodservice channel, we also supply the professional channel, including restaurants, hotels and industrial kitchens. This multichannel approach gives us access to a broad and diverse customer base, which enhances our position as a leader in many of our core categories. Because of our strong relationships with leading global and regional retailers, we operate as the supplier of choice and/or “category captain” for certain strategic retailers, providing in-depth knowledge and consumer insight for particular product categories to our retailer customers. Moreover, we believe there is considerable potential to introduce and expand our core product categories in the foodservice channel given our current portfolio’s appeal across high-end clients who lead and influence the menu adoption cycle to large quick-service restaurants, bakery chains and other national accounts where mass adoption occurs. Our growth strategy in foodservice is focused on selling value-added branded products with high-demand applications to commercial customers and driving customer acquisition through our chef-led sales approach (see also “—Sales and Marketing”). _Driving and leveraging our scale: leveraging our digitally enabled end-to-end platform and scale_ Through our end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform we produce and sell our products to retail and foodservice partners in over 100 countries globally. Our global footprint, scale and expertise along the value chain allow us to leverage efficiencies through which we can derive significant advantages compared to other plant-based competitors and dairy players. Since 2018, we have demonstrated a track record in driving efficiencies for example by establishing product portfolio efficiencies (through the retirement of SKUs that are less profitable or of low productivity and the simplification of our recipes), procurement efficiencies (by sourcing most of our ingredients and packaging materials from global suppliers who can deliver locally), supply chain efficiencies (through our established local retail and distribution network) and by maintaining a continued focus on operational efficiencies in line with our value creation program. Establishing such efficiencies allows us to offer affordable products. 6 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Strategies,9.3.2,Continuously delivering our Purpose,"Our purpose is “to make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and for our planet” and it shapes how we approach the sourcing of our ingredients, the development of our recipes, our relationships with retailers and how we communicate with consumers. We intend to continue fulfilling our purpose with our commitment and initiatives across our four pillars: (i) plant-based, (ii) healthier lives, (iii) happier people and (iv) better planet, which are at the heart of our business with tangible programs and milestones. _Plant-Based_ Actively helping the food transition and building a better, plant-based future is at the heart of what we do. Our plant-based commitment pillar seeks to help inspire and encourage consumers to switch from dairy to plant-based options. As we continue to improve our product portfolio, we aim to reach one billion consumers with our products by 2030. We believe we can achieve that goal by offering consumers a range of products that meet their needs, which also includes making sure our products taste great, perform well, and are made with simple, natural ingredients. We believe we are in a strong position to support the transition to a plant-based diet by offering tasty, affordable, nutritious and more sustainable products. From our Food Science Centre, we continuously invest in high performance product formulations and reformulations to keep up with consumer needs and trends. For example, in 2023, we launched the Violife cream cheese block in the United States which has been developed specifically to compete with leading dairy cream cheeses on the market, following a completely new formulation and format. To spread awareness around our plant-based products, we frequently launch retail consumer advertising campaigns with slogans aimed at informing and driving consumers and professionals towards more plant-based products. Other efforts to boost our brands’ and products’ visibility include, for example, sponsorship of sporting events and partnerships with celebrities and influencers. In addition, we are also working to support the industry moving forward in terms of plant-based innovation, which includes establishing standard parameters for plant-based products. For example, we are currently leading the development of a new ISO standard that we expect will specify technical definitions of, and criteria for, plant-based foods. We believe that this new ISO standard will help align the global food industry around a single terminology approach. _Healthier Lives_ The second pillar focuses on the nutritional benefits of our products as well as their positive contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and we believe is a key reason why people choose our products. We aim for our products to outperform their dairy counterparts with respect to levels of saturated and trans-fats. We take a science-based approach to establishing criteria and targets for each product type we sell, considering who uses them, how frequently and in which applications. These targets are based on recognized external international standards and official dietary recommendations, including those from the World Health Organization. Moreover, we have set additional targets that ensure we can deliver the desired nutritional composition. These include considerations on how we can limit nutrients of concern and provide essential nutrients that target some of the greatest public health areas of concern, such as heart health and children’s growth and development. Our brands BlueBand and Becel +ProActiv are our global brands focused on positively impacting lives across the world by offering healthy, affordable and nutritious options. In 2023, approximately 30% of our net sales came from products providing health and nutrition benefits and that can be labelled as such, in compliance with regulation. Additionally, we believe the future of food lies in quality, responsibly made, plant-based foods. To realize this future and provide consumers with healthier options, we intend to continue implementing rigorous quality and safety standards at both our and third-party facilities, including for product design, formulation, raw material sourcing, packing, manufacturing, storage, transport, display, marketing, communication, sales and product disposal. Moreover, we intend to continue ensuring that our products are accessible to as many people as possible, which includes ensuring our products come in at affordable price points. In this regard we intend to maintain a portfolio of products designed for budgetary brackets across the market spectrum and which are more affordable than dairy alternatives, without compromising on quality. 7 ----- _Happier People_ We believe that people are happier when they are engaged and we actively promote a culture of active support. We are committed to our community of dedicated “Upfielders.” Our approach to employee engagement is driven by three core values: performance, care and passion. To nurture an engaged workforce, we complete an annual survey to gauge employee sentiment and opportunities for progress. In addition, diverse businesses are likely to be more successful and we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive working environment. Across our supply chains, we are connected to thousands of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs who grow our ingredients and chefs who create and prepare millions of meals every day. In support of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs, we maintain several partnerships, enabling and encouraging them to improve agricultural practices and access to markets. In addition, we seek to reach as many chefs and food service professionals as possible to encourage the adoption of our products into their cooking, thereby engaging chefs in the plant-based revolution. We do this by, for example, hosting cooking workshops for chefs or participating in trade fairs where we can reach out and educate professionals on the advantages of plant-based cooking. _Better Planet_ With an environmental footprint significantly smaller than that of dairy products, our products can help consumers reduce their impact, and we ensure our operations do so as well. We are committed to responsibly sourcing ingredients, developing sustainable packaging and addressing our carbon emissions to enhance sustainability. Our better planet commitments include our environmental targets to address our material environmental impacts on the climate, on packaging and on responsible sourcing. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we committed to Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”) and have worked on redefining our targets in line with the newly published Forest, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) guidance to align with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In this respect, we are making multiple efforts towards reducing our emissions and reducing environmental impact through waste and water management at our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we are committed to providing packaging that protects products and the planet. We delivered a milestone packaging achievement with the launch of the world’s first paper-based tub for plant-based butters and spreads, our Flora Plant paper tub at the end of 2023, starting our journey towards our target of reducing plastic across our portfolio by 80% by 2030 (compared to a 2020 baseline). In addition, we are committed to responsible and sustainable sourcing of our ingredients (including our Plant Oils) and packaging materials (including paper and pulp) and our “Responsible Sourcing Policy” and “Business Partner Code of Conduct” applies to all our suppliers. Where key ingredients are identified as potentially high risk, we maintain strong individual policies designed to address the potential risks inherent in these supply chains, particularly focussing on deforestation and exploitation.

As a result, a number of our subsidiaries report their financial results in currencies other than the euro, which is the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements. So as to enhance comparability of some of key financial metrics, including net sales growth, gross profit growth, gross margin growth, Normalized EBITDA growth and Normalized EBITDA margin growth, we present such metrics on a constant currency basis. The exchange rates used for the calculation of such constant currency exchange rate metrics for a particular 21 ----- period represent the average exchange rates of the relevant currency for the prior period. By presenting such metrics on a constant currency basis, we exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations such that both the current and prior period local currency values are translated into euro using prior year average exchange rates. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non IFRS _Financial Measures—Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures” for the exchange rates used by us to calculate constant currency_ exchange rate measures in respect of our principal currencies for the relevant periods. For each such period, the exchange rates mentioned under “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non IFRS Financial Measures—Constant Currency Exchange Rate _Measures” represent the average exchange rates of the relevant currency for the prior period._ (2) Organic net sales growth/(decrease) presents a “like–for-like” comparative growth rate, and represents the change in net sales for the current period compared to the comparable prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis and by eliminating any change in scope between the relevant periods. Such change in scope between periods may result from: (i) an acquisition, divestiture or disposal of our business in a country or a major market or that of a business unit; (ii) changes to the business model under which we operate in a specific market, or with respect to the manner in which a particular product is (or particular products are) sold by us in that market (for example, if we change our local operating model from a distributor model to a royalty model, or if we change from third-party manufacturing (wherein such third-party manufacturer typically sources raw materials) to toll manufacturing (wherein we typically supply raw materials to a third party manufacturer) or (iii) the adoption of an accounting standard or a change in the application of an accounting principle, if applicable. We commenced calculating organic net sales growth/(decrease) beginning for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, we present organic net sales growth/(decrease) for the year ended December 31, 2023, the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 only. See also “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Our Results of Operation—Results of Operations” for a discussion on the reasons for the change_ in organic net sales growth/(decrease) and/or constant currency net sales growth (as described below), including in our operating segments, for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum. (3) Constant currency net sales growth presents the change in net sales for the relevant period compared to the prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis. We present constant currency net sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 only. (4) Represents the growth rate of our reported gross profit (which is our net sales minus cost of sales) calculated on a constant currency basis. (5) Represents our reported gross margin (calculated as our net sales minus cost of sales divided by net sales, and expressed as a percentage). (6) Represents the growth rate of our reported gross margin calculated on a constant currency basis. (7) Normalized EBITDA is a non-IFRS metric which is defined as net profit/(loss) before income tax expense, net finance costs, depreciation of property, plant and equipment (including right of use assets) and amortization of intangible assets, as adjusted for sharebased payment expenses and certain non-underlying items that we do not consider to be part of the Group’s daily business operations, due to the nature, frequency, and predictability of their occurrence. While the amounts included in Normalized EBITDA have been derived from our consolidated financial statements or management accounts, they are not financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, they should not be considered as alternatives to net profit/(loss) or operating profit/(loss) as indicators of our performance, or as alternatives to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. Our management uses Normalized EBITDA to assess our operating performance. In addition, we believe that Normalized EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors. Normalized EBITDA, as presented in this Offering Memorandum, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way these measures are calculated.

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"Fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials, as well as increases of supply chain costs, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.","The principal ingredient in our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses are refined Plant Oils. Aside from Plant Oils, additional key inputs used in our production process include other natural ingredients, packaging materials and utility inputs such as water and energy. We obtain substantially all of our raw materials from third-party suppliers, with cost of such materials (which includes Plant Oils, other ingredients, flavors, finished goods from third-party manufacturers and packaging materials) representing 67% and 68% of our total cost of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. The availability and cost of Plant Oils and other ingredients used in our products can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time due to a number of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, agricultural policies, government programs, weather conditions such as frosts, drought and floods, and plant diseases, pests and other acts of nature. In particular, price volatility has increased since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as due to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. For example, although we do not source sunflower oil from Ukraine directly, as Ukraine is the world’s biggest exporter of sunflower oil, beginning the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the war in Ukraine caused a global shortage of sunflower oil, which in turn led to a rise in the price of sunflower oil during the year ended December 31, 2022. Although, in response to possible disruptions in the supply chain, we created a formula that allows us to substitute and swap ingredients within our Butters and Spreads (such as sunflower oil for rapeseed oil), without any impact on the taste, texture or functionality of our products, such substitution of our recipes to prevent any supply chain disruptions may result in a higher cost base as this generally results in incremental R&D costs and a need to adjust packaging. The increase in sunflower oil prices has also had a knock-on effect on the prices of other Plant Oils, including palm, rapeseed and soybean oil, which have seen a further spike in demand as a result of their growing use as biofuel. The price of palm oil has also increased in recent years due to slower production by the main producer nations, and the recently adopted domestic market obligation policy in Indonesia, which is the world’s largest palm oil producer. Pursuant to this policy, palm oil producers in Indonesia had to set aside a certain quantity of palm oil for local buyers, thereby limiting the amount available for export. In addition, the increase in inflation globally since 2022 has further increased our costs of acquiring ingredients and the contributed to general volatility of commodity prices, and this inflationary impact continues. We may not be able to preserve our gross profit margin if such volatility, fluctuations and high inflationary conditions were to persist, as we may have limited ability to flow through our increased commodity cost in our pricing, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The past years’ significant volatility in commodity prices, the significant surge in energy and transportation prices, as well as the supply chain interruptions caused by recent geopolitical and economic events, adversely impacted our inputs suppliers’ cost base which they subsequently passed on to us. For example, because of the energy intensive nature of the refinery process to turn crude oils into refined oils, our Plant Oils suppliers have sought to pass on their heightened energy costs to us. All of this has exposed us in turn to significantly higher Plant Oils, packaging, energy costs, and as a consequence thereof, higher manufacturing, logistics and transportation costs, which we may not be able 25 ----- to effectively hedge or fully pass on to our customers. There can be no assurance that we or our third-party manufacturers will be able to obtain alternative sources of raw materials or packaging materials at reasonable prices, or at all, should there be shortages or other unfavorable conditions. To manage our input costs, we regularly monitor global market prices and enter into hedging arrangements, principally in respect of the major Plant Oils we purchase as well as utilities. We use a combination of fixed contracts and commodity derivatives (futures, over the counter and tradable forward contracts) to hedge against commodity price risk. Our policy is to hedge the majority of the risk within the relevant pricing window, and typically on a three to six months rolling basis. However, there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will successfully reduce our exposure to price volatility in the long term and, given our limited customer negotiation windows, there may be a time lag between the implementation of our pricing initiatives and the impact of inflation across our key inputs. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products or other supply chain inputs at reasonable prices, or at all, as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could cause an increase in our cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in our gross profit margin, or cause our net sales to fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may result in a decrease in gross profit margin and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,Changes in food trends and consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"Trends within our industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced demand and price reductions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are a number of changing consumer trends, demands and preferences which have an effect on both our Group and the industry in which we operate. These include dietary, health and environmental concerns and trends, such as increasing awareness of different nutritional aspects of foods and the health effects and sourcing practices relating to specific ingredients, an increasing preference for dairy-free, vegan and organic food ingredients, trends towards eating outside of home and concerns regarding public health consequences associates with obesity and increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of production (in particular those related to palm oil, which is a key ingredient in many products across our portfolio). Currently, there is an increasing trend of consumers across markets preferring nondairy, plant-based products as a result of the increasing awareness of lactose-intolerance health issues, high carbon footprint and the environmental impact of dairy consumption. However, this growing trend towards plant-based alternatives may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, such as misconceptions about “highly processed” plantbased foods, perceived “naturalness” of dairy and increased regulatory control of the plant-based sector. In addition, there has been negative press coverage in recent years as regards products made from palm oil due to both health and environmental concerns. For example, among our key markets, Spain and the Netherlands in particular, have seen a greater negative press coverage and perception as regards use of palm oil based products. In response thereto, we created a patented palm oil-free technology and we have shifted our focus on offering alternatives to palm oil in some of our markets. Although we source certified (segregated and mass balance) palm oil and offer palm oil-free options in several markets, there is a risk that additional press coverage and the resulting negative consumer perception of products made from palm oil further escalates. Although we recognize the controversy around palm oil as an ingredient and continue to innovate and create new recipes both with sustainable palm oil and alternatives to palm oil through our patented palm oilfree technology, some of our products contain palm oil and switching to exclusively palm oil-free products may not be currently technically feasible. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the conflict in the Middle East, the global markets and economy have experienced significant uncertainty. There has been a sharp rise in energy and food costs, resulting in inflationary macroeconomic conditions across most major economies and markets where we operate. Given these economic conditions, there has been a significant decline in disposable incomes of many households, creating a cost of living crisis, that has altered the purchasing habits of consumers. In these circumstances, consumers may choose to economize by purchasing non-branded or private–label brands, which may be cheaper than our products. A reduction in consumer disposable income could foster a move by our customers towards discounters and non-branded products, which would impact our market share and adversely affect our net sales. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2023, there has been a slowdown in the growth of our Plant Cheeses driven by the cost-ofliving crisis, higher prices and increased competition in certain key markets, especially in the United Kingdom. The plant cheese segment is a strategic segment for us and we intend to launch a variety of new plant cheese products and continue to further improve the nutritional value and taste of our Plant Cheeses. However, any decrease in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 26 ----- Our success will be impacted by our ability to anticipate and identify consumer trends and preferences, and to offer a portfolio of relevant products that appeal to consumer needs and preferences on a timely and affordable basis. In doing so, we may also be required to leverage our research and development capabilities, and to utilize management’s ability to launch new or improved products quickly, successfully and on a cost-effective basis. A decrease in demand for our products due to a shift in consumer tastes or preferences to which we are unable to respond in a timely and costeffective manner may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,Economic and political instability and/or unfavorable economic and political conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"Our business may be negatively affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general macroeconomic conditions, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, geopolitical events, a public health crisis and other general political and economic developments globally and in the markets in which we operate. The years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 were characterized by macroeconomic, geopolitical and supply chain issues on a global scale, due in part to political turmoil or upheaval in a number of regions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite an improvement in global economic conditions in 2021 and 2022 following the sharp global economic downturn in 2020 resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, the outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain, and certain of our key markets, including Europe and the United States, may not achieve the growth rates that they have forecasted or historically observed. Such uncertainty has been exacerbated by the global turmoil resulting from the ongoing war in Ukraine, which resulted in severe sanctions being imposed on Russia (including certain Russian entities and individuals). Examples of such sanctions include a prohibition on doing business with certain Russian companies, large financial institutions, officials and oligarchs and a commitment by certain countries and the European Union to remove selected Russian banks from SWIFT, the electronic banking network that connects banks globally. The ongoing war in Ukraine has been a driver behind severe market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, volatility in credit and capital markets, a significant surge in energy and transportation prices, as well as supply chain interruptions, which all have been, and may continue to be, key factors in driving inflationary pressure and which may ultimately adversely affect general economic conditions. Commodities and energy are the two key elements in our input cost base. Therefore, any fluctuation and volatility can have an material adverse impact on our gross profit margin. We shut down our operations in Russia in the first quarter of 2022 before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine due to strategic reasons. In 2022, we experienced minor supply chain disruptions for sunflower oil due to the war in Ukraine. In addition, tensions between China and Taiwan and the conflict in the Middle East have further enhanced the unstable geopolitical environment globally, and particularly in AMEA. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, none of our suppliers are based in Russia or Ukraine. However, further intensification of those geopolitical conflicts or its spread to other parts of the world, including certain parts of Europe, the Americas or other parts of AMEA, could cause supply chain and logistic disruptions and financial market volatility globally. Moreover, market uncertainty and volatility have also been magnified, and may continue to be impacted by, the upcoming 2024 United States presidential and congressional elections, resulting in uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in the United States and foreign trade and economic policies. In addition, general elections in numerous EU countries could lead to the exit of one or more other countries from the eurozone or other potential developments, which could be an additional source of instability in international markets. Further, some EU Member States within the eurozone could decide to discontinue their use of the euro as their functional currency. The exit of another country from the EU, or prolonged periods of uncertainty relating to this could result in significant macroeconomic deterioration, including, but not limited to, decreases in global stock exchange indices, increased foreign exchange volatility (in particular a further weakening of the pound sterling and euro against other leading currencies), and decreased GDP in the European Union. Any of these events or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could undermine confidence in the overall stability of the EU, have adverse consequences for us with respect to our overall performance in the European Union. For example, after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU on January 31, 2020, the EU treaties ceased to apply to the United Kingdom. Following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, there were changes in the legal rights and obligations among commercial parties in the United Kingdom and the EU, including (among others) financial institutions, suppliers and service providers and their respective customers. In addition, there were changes in import, tax and employment laws and regulations after the end of the transition period, resulting in an increase in the cost of importing goods from EU countries and adversely affecting our and our contractors’ and supplier’s ability in the United Kingdom to retain and recruit employees from the wider European labor market, leading to labor shortages and higher costs. Additionally, the rate of exchange of the pound sterling vis-à-vis other currencies has been very volatile since the Brexit referendum. 27 ----- Any of the foregoing events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,An inability to pass on price increases for raw materials or other inputs to our customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"Our ability to pass through increases in the prices of raw materials and other inputs, such as packaging materials and energy costs, to our customers depends, among others, on prevailing competitive conditions and pricing methods in the markets in which we operate, and we may not be able to pass through such price increases to our customers. For example, we took significant pricing actions in 2021 and 2022 to pass price increases to our customers. However, we may not always be successful in passing price increases to our customers or the actions we take may not be sufficient. Moreover, following price increases implemented by us in 2021 and 2022, we may face pressure from our customers to reduce pricing from current levels. Such demands could potentially strain our profit margins and necessitate strategic adjustments in pricing strategies to maintain our competitive position in the market. Even if we are able to pass through price increases, there is typically a time lag between cost increases affecting our business and the implementation of product price increases, which are ultimately within the discretion of the retailer, during which time our gross profit margin may be reduced. A time lag in the recovery of cost inflation, driven by either cost increases in raw materials or changes in the foreign exchange rate of the currency the raw material is denominated in, can also negatively impact our margins. In addition, during negotiations to increase prices to recover cost increases in raw materials, retailers may take actions, which exacerbate the impact of such cost increases. Our inability to pass through price increases in raw materials and other inputs and preserve our profit margins in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.5,We operate in a highly competitive market and our failure to compete may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"The categories and markets that we operate in are highly competitive globally, particularly in Europe and the United States, which account for the majority of our net sales. Our competitors include well-established branded producers that operate on both a national and an international basis across single or multiple dairy and non-dairy categories as well as retailers who promote private label products within these categories. Our competitors generally compete with us on the basis of price and promotional strategy, actual or perceived quality, health benefits and “naturalness” of products, brand recognition, consumer loyalty, product variety, new product development and improvements to existing products. In addition, we may face increased competition from new entrants in the markets in which we operate. We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or their effect on consumer perceptions or the success and timing of our own advertising and promotional efforts. For example, during 2023, we saw strong competition in the Netherlands, Germany and Poland which was largely pricing and promotionally driven and contributed to a negative volume/mix contribution for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our competitors have developed and launched products targeted to compete directly with our products. Our retail customers generally control the shelf space allocations within their stores and may allocate more shelf space to generic or private label products or to our branded competitors’ products in accordance with their respective promotional strategies. Decreases in shelf space allocated to our products, increases in competitor promotional activity, aggressive marketing strategies by competitors or other factors may require us to reduce our prices or invest greater amounts in advertising and promotion of our products to ensure our products remain competitive. In addition, given recent economic uncertainty and conditions, there has been a significant decline in disposable incomes of many households, creating a cost of living crisis, that has altered the purchasing habits of consumers, and may adversely impact the price competitiveness of our products. See also “—Changes in food trends and consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on our results of _operations.”_ Furthermore, some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than those of ours in certain markets. This creates competitive pressures that could cause us to lose market share or require us to lower prices, increase advertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns. These competitive factors may also restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Any inability to continue to respond effectively to these and other competitive pressures could negatively impact our net sales and gross profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we have a major business opportunity by highlighting the lower climate impact of our products (vs their dairy equivalents) as the global dairy and meat sectors face pressure on this point and will need to reduce carbon emissions to meet future legal climate targets in multiple geographies. For example, in 2023, we launched our “Skip the 28 ----- Cow” campaign to inspire the shift to plant-based alternatives and promote the benefits of Flora Plant in the United Kingdom, which directly competes with dairy butter and which has approximately 75% less climate impact than dairy butter. However, there is a risk we will be unable to fully leverage this opportunity because of the lobbying we face from the dairy and meat industries in certain markets. For example, the EU and the United Kingdom adopted restrictive labeling rules and banned plant-based products including terms like “milk,” “not milk,” “alternative milk” on their packages. While we have clear processes in place to refute certain pro dairy and meat proposals, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. In addition, in some markets we are subject to increased government scrutiny regarding allegedly misleading packaging as well as complaints made by the dairy industry at advertising self-regulating entities. Although we have been successful in refuting certain of these claims, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in doing so. Moreover, historically the dairy industry has successfully convinced many consumers that butter products are more “natural” and hence healthier than plant-based dairy alternatives. This perception of naturalness combined with certain customers’ taste preferences could enable dairy manufacturers to increase their market share relative to ours and other manufacturers of butters and spreads. Any of the foregoing events, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.6,"If we do not manage our supply chain adequately and effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected.","The inability of our manufacturing facilities, as well as any supplier of raw materials, third-party manufacturer, distributor or warehouse, to deliver or perform in an adequate and timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to increase and our gross profit margins to decrease. As we own a total of 14 manufacturing facilities across our operating regions, we are subject to the risks associated with operating and maintaining our manufacturing facilities, as well as relying on third-party manufacturing facilities. Our manufacturing facilities produced approximately 91% of our total production volume for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the remaining sourced from third-party manufacturers. We are therefore subject to the risks associated with operating, and must incur potentially significant capital and other expenditures necessary to maintain, our manufacturing facilities, machinery and equipment. We must maintain our manufacturing facilities in order to, among other things, keep up with demand for our products, retain sufficient capacity to manufacture new products and increase our margins. If we are unable to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity to keep up with demand for our products and ensure that our sales and production teams adequately coordinate their planning and production efforts, we risk losing potential product sales. We have relationships with multiple third-party manufacturing facilities, which produced approximately 10% of our total production volume in 2023. We currently rely on and may continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products in certain smaller volume or more emerging markets, which we would not be able to service otherwise. For example, GrainCorp Foods Australia Pty Limited (“GrainCorp”) is the only manufacturer of our products that are sold within Australia and New Zealand. If GrainCorp had a material issue or delay in their manufacturing process or if our contract was terminated without finding a substitute manufacturer, our business may be adversely affected. Our third-party manufacturers are required by us to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications and requirements for certain certifications. However, we have less control over third-party manufacturing facilities when compared to directly owned facilities. As a result, the failure of any third-party manufacturer to produce products that conform to our standards could materially and adversely affect our reputation and result in product recalls, product liability claims and economic loss. We also face risks of competitive access to our intellectual property when third-party manufacturers require access to our formulas and trade secrets as a condition to doing business with us. Any loss of the use of all or a portion of our own or contracted third-party facilities due to accidents, fires, explosions, labor issues, supply interruptions, transportation interruptions, human error, mechanical failure, terrorist acts, power outages, discharges or releases of hazardous substances and other environmental issues, or otherwise, whether short- or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms and earthquakes could also damage our facilities, impair production capabilities, and disrupt our supply chain for commodities or packaging materials, significantly impact the availability of our raw materials and the costs thereof, or impact demand for our products. Our sole manufacturing plant in Kansas, United States, produces the substantial majority of all our products sold in the United States and the vast majority of our global volumes of cream are produced at the Kleve manufacturing facility in Germany. Our manufacturing facilities in Corlu, Turkey and Drama, Greece produce a substantial part of our Plant Butter and Spreads and Plant Cheeses, respectively; they are, however, located in a seismic zone and therefore subject to a significantly higher risk of negative impacts resulting from earthquakes in particular. Any loss of the use of all or a portion of any of such key facilities could result in substantial business losses, production delays, third 29 ----- party lawsuits and significant repair costs, as well as personal injury and/or loss of life, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, while we have insurance coverage in place, unexpected failures of our equipment and machinery could result in production delays, turnover loss and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to our employees. In some cases, manufacturing facilities are designated for certain types of products based on the unique equipment involved and it is more difficult, or impossible, for us to shift production of these products among our facilities. Any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation and could require significant lead time replacing, which could have a negative impact on our gross profit margin and cash flows. A loss or interruption in production at certain of our facilities could disrupt our operations and affect a large number of customers, decreasing our net sales. The operation of manufacturing facilities also requires us to hire, train and evaluate large numbers of production employees, which involves additional labor and employment related risks and uncertainties. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to losses associated with equipment shutdowns, which may be caused by the loss or interruption of electrical power to manufacturing facilities due to unusually high demand, blackouts, adverse weather, equipment failure or other catastrophic events. Losses caused by disruptions in the supply of electrical power could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are dependent on third-party suppliers of raw materials and packaging for our products. Our suppliers may fail to meet timelines or contractual obligations or provide sufficient products, which may adversely affect our business. Failure to appropriately structure or adequately manage our agreements with third parties may adversely affect our availability of supply, which in turn affects our ability to manufacture our products. We are also dependent on third parties for most of our warehousing and substantially all of our transportation requirements. Certain factors affecting distribution costs, including oil prices, are either subject to market fluctuations or controlled by our third-party carriers. For example, fuel prices have been high in recent years and have fluctuated as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as global and regional supply and demand. Moreover, geopolitical and economic uncertainties due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, which have threatened supply lines and resulted in embargoes of certain supply sources, as well as pricing and availability of fuel supplies. Moreover, temporary or long-term disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events could impair our ability to supply products affordably or in a timely manner. If we are unable to timely receive raw materials or produce and effectively distribute sufficient quantities in response to demand for our products, consumers may look to purchase alternative or competitive products. Moreover, if we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently, our operating costs could increase, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in some markets we rely on a small number of distributors to satisfy demand from numerous, small, traditional trade outlets. Also in Brazil and Peru we serve the market with only one major distributor for each of those countries. The failure of any of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in such market. This could, in turn, also have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Strategic decisions taken for any particular market that turn out to be unsuccessful can create a public backlash and have an unfavorable impact across the Group. A significant majority of our net sales derives from sales of our power brands, and the success of our business has resulted from the strength of our brands. Our financial success is directly dependent on consumer and customer perception of such key brands, including as an example, Flora, Country Crock, Becel+ProActiv, Rama, BlueBand and Violife. The success of our brands may suffer if our marketing plans, marketing spend levels or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or our ability to attract consumers or if consumer or customer perceptions of our brands or products change unfavorably. In particular, our investments in marketing activities for any new brands and projects may divert resources from our existing brands and products, and there can be no assurance that such investments will be successful or that consumer or customer perceptions of our existing brands will not suffer as a result. In addition, our results of operations could be negatively affected if the reputation of one or more of our brands suffers damage due to real or perceived quality issues with our products, unsuccessful marketing campaigns or if we have found to have materially violated any applicable laws or regulations. We have limited control over third-party manufacturers, distributors and other commercial partners. Any 30 ----- failure of such third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our reputation and result in product recalls, product liability claims and economic loss. In addition, unsuccessful interactions with governments and NGOs of the countries we are operating in may also affect the perception of the Group by our investors, cause reputational damage and adversely affect our results of operations. Any circumstances which publicly damage our customer goodwill, injures our reputation or damages our business relationships may lead to a broader adverse effect on our business and prospects by way of loss of business, goodwill, customers and employees beyond the monetary liability arising directly from the damaging events.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.8,Fluctuations in energy and freight costs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"In addition to our dependence on primary raw materials, due to the energy intensive nature of our manufacturing process and the critical importance of transportation to our manufacturing, supply and logistics processes, we rely on a number of different energy sources, including oil, electricity and natural gas. If, for any reason, certain of our energy supply contracts were terminated in a country where we have major operations, or were not renewed upon expiration, or if market conditions were to substantially change resulting in a significant decrease in energy supply in the European Union or a significant increase in the price of oil, electricity or natural gas, including as a result of the heightened energy prices following the war in Ukraine, we may not be able to find alternative, comparable suppliers or suppliers capable of providing oil, electricity or natural gas on pricing, terms or volume satisfactory to us, or we may be forced to change our manufacturing practices, thereby increasing our operational costs and potential carbon footprint. As a result of any of these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected. We also heavily rely on third parties for the transportation of our raw materials, as well as for the products we manufacture and sell. In certain jurisdictions, we are exposed to import duties and freight costs. Freight costs are influenced by carrier availability and fluctuating oil prices, which, in turn, have been impacted by the ongoing inflationary surge and related supply chain disruptions. Major global events such as fluctuating commodity prices, geopolitical conflicts, new regulations like the new EU mobility package (which aims to promote road safety and better working conditions for drivers through the adoption of certain limitations like drivers’ driving times and rest period) may increase the cost base of our carriers or cause interruptions in our transportation operations. For instance, the recent military conflict between Israel and Hamas and its spillover effects throughout the Middle East, including the Red Sea, has led to delays and increased freight rates due to the rerouting of ships around South Africa. Such events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our strong brands and presence in the markets we operate in provides us the ability to pass on such input prices to our customers, however, such ability is limited and we may not be able to agree price adjustments to effectively cover our energy costs with our customers, or may only be able to pass them through on a delayed basis. Moreover, an increase in the selling prices for our products resulting from an attempt to pass through increased energy or freight costs may decrease the price competitiveness of our products, which may negatively impact the volume of our sales, and in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have hedging arrangments in place and manage risks related to transportation through our monitoring systems and a tailored procurement process with respect to our third-party logistics providers, our current policies and precautionary actions cannot fully eliminate any of the above risks.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

A key element of our growth strategy is to introduce new products and continue to upgrade, re-launch and extend existing product lines in each of the markets in which we operate to increase overall sales of our products. We will also seek to expand our distribution channels. There can be no assurance that any new product line or channel which we might expand into will develop into a viable offering, or that any investment made in expanding into such adjacent product categories or distribution channels will be adequately rewarded. By 2050, our global food system is expected to need to feed nearly 10 billion people worldwide. We believe that this requires a shift to predominantly plant-based diets with lower consumption of animal derived foods. To meet this challenge, we aim to be 100% plant-based by 2030, which requires continued active innovation and reformulation of our products. However, the launch and success of new or modified products are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance as to our continuing ability to develop and launch successful new products or variations of existing products. The success of our product development is affected by our ability to anticipate changing consumer trends and preferences, to leverage our research and development capabilities, and to utilize management’s ability to launch new or improved products quickly, successfully and on a cost-effective basis. If we are unsuccessful in developing new products in an 31 ----- efficient and economical manner and we do not achieve the desired results from our strategic partnerships, demand for our products may decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our business can be affected by risks related to expansion into new international markets, particularly emerging markets. We are also exposed to reputational risks connected to a potential failure to manage and properly implement these growth initiatives. New international markets could develop more slowly than we expect at any given time. Entry into a new market may require a local manufacturing or distribution partner, which may be difficult to obtain or slow down the speed of expansion. Should further expansion into international markets not be successful or not be as successful as planned, the investments made might not result in the desired growth in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Growth can carry risks relating to the adequacy of our resources and the capacity of management and employees to properly manage all critical issues, resulting in a focus on certain initiatives to the detriment of others and a failure to properly anticipate risks to our global supply chain. Growth risks also include risks related to potential mergers and acquisitions, including potential liability under acquisition agreements, product liability and environmental responsibility risks as well as reputational and personnel related risks. The success of any merger or acquisition is also dependent on our management’s ability to successfully integrate such companies into existing operations. Any failure to manage risks related to potential mergers and acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

As part of our strategy, we will continue to seek to expand our sales and market share in various international markets, including by acquiring new companies to enable us to expand our product offering. The economies of some of the countries in which we operate in Eastern Europe, Asia, LatAm and Africa differ from the economies of Western Europe, the United States and Canada and in some cases present a greater risk profile. Many of these countries have implemented measures aimed at improving the business environment and providing a stable platform for economic development. However, the political, economic and legal reforms necessary to complete such a transformation may not be implemented fully or may not be successful, and the governments of these countries may implement policies, measures, controls or other actions which could restrict our business operations, acceptance of our products or harm our financial results. The risks inherent in the countries where we operate include, but are not limited to: - political, social and economic instability; - fluctuations in currency exchange rates and currency devaluations; - government policies and regulations, including more stringent regulation on labelling, packaging, including the use of plastic, deforestation, payment terms or in respect of labor laws; - more stringent reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, supply chain due diligence reporting requirements and ESG reporting requirements; - tariffs, duties, export controls and other trade barriers; - varying tax regimes that could harm our results of operations, including withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by our subsidiaries; - longer account receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; - foreign exchange controls or restrictions on profit repatriation; - nationalization or expropriation of property without fair compensation; - recessionary trends, inflation and instability of the financial markets; - the introduction or application of more stringent restrictions on investments; 32 ----- - the possibility of natural disaster (including the earthquake in Turkey in 2022), war (including the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East), civil disturbance, acts of terrorism or other social conflicts; - any epidemics or pandemics, ineffective and varying responses from local governments and competent authorities; - unfair competition, in certain markets in which we compete; - changes in the interest rate environment; and - fluctuations in local economic growth. We are exposed to these risks in all of our operations to some degree, and such exposure may reduce demand for our products and as a result negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, especially in emerging markets where the political and legal environment is less stable. Although we have monitoring practices and policies in place to tackle risks that arise during the course of our business, the systems, policies and practices we implement may not be sufficient to fully anticipate these risks before they arise or we may not be able to effectively manage these risks. As a result, we may be subject to material adverse developments with respect to our international operations or incur additional costs while managing these risks and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses across both developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

As of March 31, 2024, the book value of our goodwill amounted to €3,827 million, while our other intangible assets amounted to €3,307 million. In accordance with IFRS, we evaluate goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually, or earlier in the case of a triggering event. Goodwill impairment is indicated and indefinite life intangible assets are impaired when their carrying amount exceeds their estimated recoverable amount, which is the greater of their value in use and their fair value less cost to sell. A decrease in expected cash flows, changes in market conditions, loss of key customers or a change in our imputed cost of capital may require potential impairment of recorded goodwill and/or other intangible assets. Weakness in the global economy, including due to the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and the recent inflationary surge, also may cause us to make impairment charges. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to the income statement. Although the Group has not recorded any charges for goodwill impairment during its most recent year, there can be no assurance that goodwill impairment charges will not be incurred in the future. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.12,We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risks and such may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.,"We operate internationally and, as a result, we have considerable cash flow, revenue, costs, assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and are exposed to changes in various currency exchange rates. We have exchange rate exposure in our key markets particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Indonesian rupiah and the Turkish lira against the euro. Our exposure to changes in exchange rates can mainly be described in terms of translation exposure and transaction exposure. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate our assets, liabilities, net sales and costs into euro. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the euro against these other currencies will affect the amounts attributed to these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period. For example, the significant Turkish lira depreciation was a main contributor in the decline of net sales in AMEA, as reported in euro, for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, the euro to pound sterling and the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates have been volatile during recent years due to various factors including the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, our exchange rate transaction risks principally relate to purchases of raw materials including Plant Oils, which have underlying global commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollar or may have a degree of correlation with the U.S. dollar (despite underlying indexes being priced in euro or other currencies). As a result hereof, we are exposed to a transaction risk since such U.S. dollar denominated raw materials are mainly invoiced to us in euro. 33 ----- Other ingredient and packaging costs (apart from certain commodity inputs) are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the jurisdictions in which our operations (including manufacturing plants and distribution hubs) are located, which in most cases correlate to the markets and currencies in which sales are made. Therefore, to the extent we incur costs that are not denominated in the same currency as the related net sales, exchange rate fluctuations could cause our costs to increase as a percentage of net sales, affecting our gross profit margin. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the European Anti-Bribery Conventions and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to a number of modern slavery, human trafficking and forced labor reporting, training and due diligence laws, such as the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 and similar legislation in various jurisdictions and additional statutory regimes to fight these crimes may be enacted in the future. Due to the global scale of our business, some of our operations may be conducted in jurisdictions that lack a developed legal system or have experienced widespread corruption. Under certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. While we have a robust compliance framework in place that is spread across our key regions to identify and mitigate the risks of breach of local laws, fraud, bribery, corruption and any incidents involving ethics and integrity, and conduct regular trainings with different parts of the business on regional laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we can detect or prevent every instance of fraud, bribery, corruption or breaches of ethics or integrity involving our employees, business partners or agents. Furthermore, operating under multiple jurisdictions adds complexity in relation to tracking, understanding and abiding to laws and regulations. We have domestic distribution channels (i.e., our retailers and distributors) in our markets and our products meet our end-consumers through these intermediaries. There is a risk that such distribution channels may take misaligned decisions that would violate local laws or may be involved in illegitimate activities in local markets that are unknown to us. If we fail to adequately monitor them or maintain an adequate compliance program, we may be liable for their actions. Violations of anti-corruption laws can result in civil penalties, fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively impact our reputation and consequently, our ability to enter into new contracts or renew our existing contracts. On the other hand, any such violation by our competitors, if undetected, could give them an unfair advantage when bidding for contracts. The consequences that we may suffer due to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

There is an increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Any impacts on our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. We have partnered with climate experts to conduct a climate scenario analysis aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Our analysis has shown that with a potential temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius, there will be a risk of more frequent severe weather events such as floods and heatwaves. Severe weather events may result in adverse physical impacts on our sites, natural resources on which we use in our production process, such as water, or portions of our infrastructure, which could disrupt our supply chain and ultimately our business operations. Major weather phenomena like El Niño and La Niña may have a dramatic effect on agricultural activities and crops. The El Niño weather phenomenon has now returned and is expected to last at least through the first half of 2024, resulting in further temperature increases both on land and at sea. This may result in seasonal 34 ----- drought and harm agriculture in certain regions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we sourced the majority of our palm oil (which counts for approximately 36% of our total Plant Oils volume) from Indonesia and Malaysia, so the growing climate concerns in these countries carry heightened importance. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions as a result of changing weather patterns may affect the quality, limit the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials and cause delays or disruptions in our production and logistics. Although we have developed procedures to respond to the effects of such events, including our ability to flex and change our recipes and pivot to alternative ingredients, where appropriate, and our overall analysis aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD indicated a low financial risk on gross revenue, our efforts may not be sufficient. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Throughout our markets, and particularly in Europe and the United States (where we derived the majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023), the food retail segments are highly concentrated. In recent years, the major retailers in many of our key markets have increased their share of the grocery market through consolidation, pricing initiatives (such as discounts and promotions) or other measures. Many retailers have also formed or joined buying groups and buying alliances, including a number of European based groups such as Epic Partners, Everest, Eurelec and Eureka amongst others, and price competition between retailers has intensified. This price competition has led retailers, buying groups and alliances to seek lower prices from their suppliers, including us, and in some cases to protracted negotiations. The strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position gives them significant leverage over their suppliers in negotiating pricing, product specification and the level of supplier participation in promotional campaigns and offers, which can reduce our gross profit margins. Further consolidation among the major retailers or disproportionate customer growth in relation to their competitors could increase their relative negotiating power and allow them to force a negative shift in our trade terms. Our results of operations could also be adversely affected if we are required to reduce our prices or increase our promotional spending activity as a consequence of an increase in the strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position, if we lose business from a major retail customer or if our relationship with a major customer deteriorates. Food retailers, including mainstream grocery chains which carry our products as well as discount chains (such as Aldi and Lidl) which tend not to carry major brands, also offer generic or private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. There is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to private label products or the branded products of our competitors, which would adversely affect sales of our products. In addition, given the growth in market share of discount grocery chains, there is a risk that consumers could increasingly shop at discount chains offering only private label products, which would adversely affect sales of our products and put increasing pressure on our mainstream grocery chain customers. In these circumstances, consumers may choose to economize by purchasing non-branded or private label brands. In the event our tenders to supply private label products to certain retailers, we may win back some volume but at the expense of lower net sales and gross profit margins. We may be unable to adequately respond to these trends and, as a result, the volume of our sales may decrease or we may need to lower the prices of our products, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Any failure of our IT systems or any ineffective digital transformations (including upgrades and/or migrations to new suppliers, new systems or applications) or system designs could impair our ability to receive, process and reconcile transactions, manage supply chain and manufacturing functions, manage compliance and risk functions, and conduct other day-to-day operations of the business. Such digital transformations also rely on effective master data management and business change management, in combination with overall IT systems. In addition, our computer and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including attacks by computer malware, electronic break-ins or cyber-attacks, theft or corruption of confidential data or other unanticipated problems. We have implemented backup and restoration solutions to ensure speedy recovery across our key IT platforms, improved our disaster recovery plans around critical processes during crisis and entered into improved service level agreements with third-party suppliers. However, any significant disruption of our computer or communication systems could affect our ability to manage our IT systems or lead to recovery costs, litigation brought by 35 ----- customers or business partners, reputational damage or a diminished ability to operate the business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we enter into acquisition transactions in the future, the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire may be complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets’ information systems. For example, we acquired Arivia in 2020 and successfully completed Arivia’s IT integration to our IT platform in the year ended December 31, 2023. During the integration process, we were exposed to risk of disruption of our IT systems. Such disruption could ultimately prevent us from meeting our strategic objectives and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As part of our business, we collect, retain and process certain confidential information, including the personal data of consumers, customers and employees. As a result, our operations are subject to data protection and privacy laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “EU GDPR”). Further, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK GDPR” and together with the EU GDPR, “GDPR”) came into effect on January 1, 2021, and, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the EU GDPR in UK national law following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains uncertain. Therefore, compliance with the GDPR may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliancerelated costs and expenses and these changes may lead to other additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. Moreover, the GDPR may lead to significant financial penalties if we breach the requirements thereof. In addition, noncompliance or technical defects resulting in a leak or the misuse of personal data could also result in damage to our reputation and otherwise harm our business. Moreover, we do not currently have specific data security insurance coverage and we cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Should one or more of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.17,We are subject to credit risk with respect to our customers and suppliers.,"Our business is subject to the risks of non-payment and non-performance by our customers. We manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, monitoring procedures, credit insurance, factoring and sometimes uses of letters of credit, prepayments and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies cannot fully eliminate customer credit risk, and to the extent our policies and procedures prove to be inadequate, it could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our customers, particularly in emerging markets, may be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks and, even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with such parties. If our customers fail to fulfil their contractual obligations, our business, financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, countries in which we operate may enact new laws that limit payment terms, which may have an adverse effect on our business. For example, the European Union has proposed a new regulation on late payments on September 12, 2023 that aims to limit payment terms to small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) to 30 days to ensure fairness in commercial transactions. Should the scope of application of such regulation be extended beyond small and medium enterprises to also include large companies (from whom we source a majority of our Plant Oils and other key ingredients), such regulation may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and our profitability or may lead to renegotiations with some of our suppliers. We are also subject to credit risk with respect to our third-party suppliers. If any such suppliers become insolvent, an appointed trustee could potentially ignore the service contracts we have in place with such party, resulting in increased charges or the termination of the service contracts. We may not be able to replace a service provider within a reasonable period of time, on as favorable terms or without disruption to our operations. Any of the foregoing factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flow and liquidity (especially since we historically managed our trade payables typically on 90 to 120 day terms), as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.18,Our business depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property effectively and any inability to protect our intellectual property could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.,"Our business depends substantially on the legal protection of proprietary rights in intellectual property that we own or license. We also claim proprietary rights in various patented technologies, know-how, trade secrets (including formulas), trademarks and service marks relating to our products and manufacturing processes. Our ability to implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to expand brand recognition using trademarks, service marks and other 36 ----- proprietary intellectual property, including for our brand names and logos, and on our ability to exploit our proprietary knowledge with respect to manufacturing processes. If existing contractual measures fail to protect our proprietary rights, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes our intellectual property, any advantage those proprietary rights provide may be negated and the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. Monitoring infringement of intellectual property rights is difficult and we cannot be certain that the precautions we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property (including trade secrets and know-how), particularly in countries where we do not have trademarks or patents at all or where the laws of such country may not be a member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, an international treaty that provides a framework for mutual recognition of patents and trademarks among member countries, and thus we may not have the desired level of protection of our proprietary rights. As we expand our operations into new markets, we become increasingly exposed to intellectual property laws, which may prove to be inadequate for protecting our rights. Accordingly, other parties, including competitors, may duplicate our products using our proprietary technologies. Pursuing legal remedies against persons infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights or otherwise improperly using our proprietary information is a costly and time-consuming process that could divert resources from the conduct of our business. When we or our licensor seeks to enforce their respective intellectual property rights, defendants are permitted to challenge the validity of the relevant intellectual property, which could have the impact of invalidating or limiting the scope of our owned or licensed intellectual property, which may cause harm to our image, brand or competitive position. In addition, patent infringement cases can involve hearings in which the court determines the boundaries of the patent in dispute, which could limit the utility of our or our licensor’s patents.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

There is a risk that any of the countries in which we operate enact unfavorable regulations, which may have an impact on our business growth, including regulations concerning packaging, raw materials or reformulation requirements. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, product recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our industry also faces increasing public and community pressure to consume energy more efficiently, including through the use of renewable fuels, and to reduce waste. For example, the European Union’s Deforestation Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115) (the “Deforestation Regulation”), came into force on June 29, 2023 and bans import of certain commodities, including palm oil, soy and paper, if they are produced by contributing to deforestation of lands. We have sustainable palm oil, soy and paper policies in place and, on the basis thereof, we have taken measures to ensure our suppliers adhere to our commitment to no deforestation. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 100% of our palm oil and soybean oil were sustainably sourced and 100% of our paper and pulp supply was sustainably sourced. Even though we have taken measures to ensure transparency, and have a strong level of due diligence in monitoring our supply chains, with stricter environmental policies being implemented in the regions in which we operate, we may fail to fully adhere to these heightened regulatory requirements. Not adhering to the Deforestation Regulation may cause material disruptions in our supply chain, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, on January 5, 2023, EU Directive No 2464/2022 on Corporate Sustainability Reporting (the “CSRD”) was adopted and entered into force. The CSRD introduces new mandatory reporting obligations that will require the publication of sustainability information. Further reporting standards are due to be adopted by June 2026, including for in-scope non-EU entities. Companies that fall under the scope of the CSRD have to report in their annual reports to what extent their activities are covered by the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) and comply with the criteria set in the EU Taxonomy Regulation delegated acts. Following the coming into force of CSRD, we expect to cover any additional reporting required by CSRD and not already covered in our reporting for the period beginning with the year ended December 31, 2025. Moreover, regulators may impose heightened disclosure requirements concerning our supply chain or ESGrelated matters, such as the proposed EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), or may impose further restrictions that may affect how we conduct our business, such as the proposed EU regulation on late payments on September 12, 2023 that aims to limit payment terms to SMEs to 30 days to ensure fairness in commercial transactions. 37 ----- Moreover, we might incur additional operational costs while ensuring compliance with these new regulations and any failure to adapt to these regulatory changes may lead to penalties and reputational harm. In addition, our manufacturing facilities as well as those of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers are subject to licensing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities. These governmental authorities differ between jurisdictions but broadly include national and local health, environmental, labor relations, sanitation, building, zoning, and fire and safety departments. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licenses or approval could delay or prevent the development, expansion or operation of a given production or warehouse facility. Any changes in those regulations may require us to implement new quality controls and possibly invest in new equipment, which could delay the development of new products and increase our operating costs. All of our products must comply with strict national and international hygiene regulations. Our facilities and our suppliers’ facilities are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms and other raw materials. Despite the precautions we undertake, should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection or otherwise, authorities may temporarily shut down any of our facilities and levy a fine for such noncompliance. Finally, any attempt to expand production may attract the scrutiny of European and other competition and antitrust regulators, and such an attempt may not succeed. In addition, our size and prominence in the butters and spreads market may prompt heightened scrutiny by such regulators seeking to restrain anti-competitive market practices. Any competition or anti-trust investigation could require significant legal expenditures and result in liabilities or adverse governmental orders. Such developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.20,"We may be adversely impacted by environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, including if we are unable to meet goals and commitments that we establish in relation to such matters.","In recent years, there has been an increased focus from investors, governmental and nongovernmental entities, and the public on ESG matters, including greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, packaging and waste, practices related to sustainable supply chain, energy use, diversity, equity and inclusion, human rights and social commitment. A variety of organizations evaluate, and measure the performance of, companies on such ESG matters, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company’s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, customer, or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation, and customer and employee retention may be negatively impacted. We have established and publicly announced certain ESG goals, commitments and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. For example, we have four ESG pillars: (i) plant-based, (ii) healthier lives, (iii) happier people and (iv) better planet, and we have set goals as part of our corporate ESG strategy under each of these pillars. The execution of our ESG strategy to achieve these goals, commitments, and targets are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which may be outside of our control and prove to be more costly than we anticipate. These risks and uncertainties include our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes, unforeseen operational and technological difficulties, the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments and the success of our collaborations with third parties. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, to achieve our ESG goals, commitments, and targets could damage our reputation and customer, investor and other stakeholder relationships, and may even result in regulatory enforcement action. Such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

We sell food products for human consumption, which subjects us to safety risks such as product contamination, spoilage, misbranding or product tampering. Product contamination, including the presence of a foreign 38 ----- object, substance, and chemical or other agent or residue could require product withdrawals, recalls, or the destruction of inventory, and could result in negative publicity, temporary plant closures and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. We are also subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread contamination. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products in response to public health concerns and consumers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy. We may be harmed by publicity concerning any assertion that our products caused illness or injury, and could become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness stemming from product contamination or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products. Any significant lawsuit or widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand, reputation and image and negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects for growth, and consequently also the value of our brands. In addition, product recalls are difficult to foresee and prepare for and, in the event we are required to recall one or more of our products, such recall may result in damage to our brands’ image, loss of sales and diversion of management’s time and attention. We maintain systems designed to monitor food safety risks and require our suppliers to do so as well. However, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will be successful or that such risks will not materialize. In addition, although we attempt, through contractual relationships and regular inspections, to control the risk of contamination caused by third parties in relation to the manufacturing and distribution processes we outsource, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will be successful or that contamination of our products by third parties will not materialize. We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury or death stemming from the consumption of a mislabeled, misbranded, altered, contaminated or spoiled product, which could negatively affect our business. Awards of damages, settlement amounts and fees and expenses resulting from such claims and the public relations implications of any such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The availability and price of insurance to cover claims for damages are subject to market forces that we do not control, and such insurance may not cover all the costs of such claims and would not cover damage to our reputation. Even if product liability claims against us are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time consuming, increase our insurance premiums and divert management’s time and resources towards defending them rather than operating the business. In addition, any adverse publicity concerning such claims, even if unfounded, could cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products and damage our reputation and brand image. Evolving nutritional and health-related concerns have led to negative publicity in the food industry concerning the health implications of genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”), obesity, trans-fat and diacetyl. In particular, the food industry has been experiencing a significant trend in which an increasing number of consumers are requiring only non-GMO and other specialized ingredients in their foods. Part of our contribution to the shift towards more plant-based diets is our 100% plant-based target by 2030, which requires active innovation and reformulation of several of our products. In order to replicate the texture of animal-derived foods using dairy-free ingredients, we sometimes rely on the use of enzymes or other proteins produced by GMOs to replace animal proteins, just as genetically modified enzymes are used in the production of many foods (for example, chymosin is an enzyme used to produce some dairy cheeses, it can be obtained from animal and from GMO sources). We seek to control any potential risks of using GMOs in our products by following all regulatory requirements to ensure our products are safe, including the sourcing of GMO and non-GMO ingredients. Sourcing non-GMO and other specialized ingredients increases costs because such raw materials are generally less widely available and therefore more expensive and we may not be able to increase our prices to reflect this increased cost. As additional retailers require or consider requiring all of their products to be non-GMO, additional pressure may come to bear on manufacturers to find sources of raw materials which are non-GMO and to assure absence of GMO from their respective supply chains. This may be particularly difficult in the United States, where most farmers produce genetically modified foods, making it difficult to source and assure non-GMO ingredients and raw materials. Companies that fail to source and assure non-GMO and other specialized ingredients could, over time, lose market share, suffer harm to their brand images and face decreasing sales. Consumers may increasingly require that foods meet stricter standards than are required by applicable governmental agencies, which would further increase the cost of manufacturing such foods and ingredients. In addition, legislation could also require companies to move to GMO-free labelling or other higher cost ingredients, which could result in changes to our labelling, advertising and/or packaging. Any of the foregoing factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 39 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

We have also been involved in negotiations on collective bargaining agreements. A labor stoppage or other interruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could impact our ability to supply customers and could have a pronounced effect on our operations. Future labor disturbances or work stoppages at any of our or our suppliers’ facilities or affecting their supply chains, or an inability to negotiate or renew collective bargaining agreements from time to time on suitable terms or at all, may have an adverse effect on such facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An increase in labor and employee benefit costs could adversely affect our profitability. Most of the factors affecting labor costs are beyond our control and we may not be able to adjust our pricing to reflect an increase in labor costs. A shortage of qualified employees, general inflationary pressure on wages or an increase in national minimum wages or industry or union agreed wages in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our labor costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The extent and impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which we operate. For example, the U.S. business typically experiences a spike in the fourth quarter of the year which is driven by Thanksgiving and Christmas baking. Similarly, there can be some seasonality in sales in Europe and the Americas owing to Easter, which can occur during the first or second quarter of the year. Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak in butter and spreads usage for cooking and baking during the Ramadan festival season, which can occur in various quarters from year to year. Furthermore, across all the countries in which we operate, the timing of product promotions drives volatility from normal consumption. While our sales are seasonal, many of our costs, such as personnel costs, are incurred more evenly throughout the year, which could affect measures of profitability in the short term and put pressure on our working capital position. In addition, for these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a reliable indication of the performance of our business or how we may perform in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

These actions and proceedings may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged breach of contract or violation of consumer protection statutes and other regulations, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, liquidated damages, consequential damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in civil, criminal or regulatory actions. These actions may relate to commercial, employment, environmental, food quality, food safety, food labelling, anti-trust, international trade, taxation, intellectual property, advertising and similar matters. For example, our marketing could face allegations of false or misleading advertising or other criticisms which could result in litigation and potential liabilities or costs in certain jurisdictions. For example, since 2022 a series of alleged putative class action lawsuits have been brought or threatened against Upfield US Inc., which generally allege that Upfield US Inc. has engaged in misleading labelling and advertising of its products and violated various state consumer fraud and deceptive business practice acts. The plaintiffs seek to certify classes of individuals who have purchased the named products in certain states within the United States. See “Business—Litigation.” In addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending ourselves or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements. The costs and other effects of pending and potential litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the ultimate resolution of any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the event we are unsuccessful in any litigation, proceedings or other disputes, we could be exposed to the risk that the provisions for associated costs and fees, if any, may be insufficient or that, even if we are not impacted monetarily, we could face the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements or inspections and/or could suffer damage to our image and reputation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 40 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

As a result, our business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements, economic conditions and unforeseeable developments in these markets, all or any of which could result in disruption of our activities. These risks include, among others, political instability, differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions, unexpected changes in regulatory environments, currency exchange rate fluctuations, inability to collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague commercial or other laws, changes in distribution and supply channels, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds, and difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees.

We cannot guarantee that we will succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies which will be effective in each location where we do business. We must comply with complex and evolving tax regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, which subjects us to international tax compliance risks. Some tax jurisdictions in which we operate have complex and subjective rules regarding income tax, value-added tax, sales or excise tax and transfer tax. Additionally, we are subject to Pillar Two’s global minimum tax. The impact per jurisdiction depends on the implementation of the OECD’s Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules or the EU’s Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523 of December 14, 2022 on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the European Union. From time to time, we may be subject to tax audits in certain jurisdictions, which may subject our business in such jurisdictions to restrictions pending resolution and pursuant to which we may be required to pay additional taxes, interest or penalties should the taxing authority assert different interpretations, or different allocations or valuations of our services which could be material and could reduce our income and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Health, safety and environmental legislation in Europe, the United States and elsewhere have generally become more comprehensive and restrictive and more rigid over time and enforcement has become more stringent. Failure to comply with applicable requirements, or the terms of required permits, can result in penalties or fines, clean-up costs, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate or from which we source raw materials and ingredients become more stringent in the future, the extent and timing of investments required to maintain compliance may exceed our budget or estimates and may limit the availability of funding for other investments. Furthermore, under some environmental laws, we could be liable for costs incurred in investigating or remediating contamination at our facilities, even if the contamination was caused by an unrelated party, and even if the 41 ----- activity which caused the contamination was legal at the time it occurred.

If the Issuer is affected by the aforementioned provision, the Issuer may no longer be able to (fully) deduct the interest expenses due to the holders of the Notes as a result of which the Dutch corporate income tax burden may increase, until such time as interest is permitted to be deducted in accordance with the Dutch Fiscal EBITDA Rule. The Dutch tax rate is currently 25.8% (a reduced rate of 19% applies to the first €200,000 of taxable profit). In addition, deemed interest payments to an affiliated (gelieerde) entity of the Issuer may be taxed with Dutch withholding tax to a rate of 25.8% if the beneficiary (voordeelgerechtigde) of the payment is (i) an entity tax resident in a low-tax jurisdiction or the benefit of the payment is attributable to an entity / permanent establishment in a low-tax jurisdiction, or (ii) an entity not tax resident in a low-tax jurisdiction but established in a jurisdiction receiving the payment with the aim to avoid taxation (subjective test) and the construction should be considered artificial (objective test), all within the meaning of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting 2021).

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer’s only material assets will be its equity interest in its subsidiaries. The Issuer’s ability to make payments on or to refinance the Senior Secured Notes or other debt obligations will depend upon the availability of cash on hand, the Group’s ability to generate and upstream cash from our operating subsidiaries to the Issuer and upon the Group’s operating performance, which is affected by all the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We will only be able to pay interest, or principal, on the Senior Secured Notes from funds received from the operating subsidiaries of the Group. Our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow and to upstream distributions to the Issuer in the form of dividends. Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and we may decide not to, or be unable to, declare a dividend. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture, as well as future debt, may prevent or restrict our ability to upstream cash or to make distributions or payments of capital or income or use cash or other assets to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes.

Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral, with such enforcement proceeds required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. If a Priority Facility is introduced that ranks in priority to the Senior Secured Notes with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral, the Security Agent would be required to apply turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging any priority obligations (including the Priority Facility, certain operating facilities and certain hedging obligations, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes.

The Collateral has not been appraised by us or on our behalf.,"The Senior Secured Notes will be secured on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement by security interests in the Collateral, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. To the extent that the claims against the Issuer exceed the value of the assets securing the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities and other obligations secured on a pari passu or priority basis with the Senior Secured Notes, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of any of our other senior unsecured indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, and those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid. The Collateral may also be released or otherwise reduced without the consent of holders in the future. Particularly, there is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient to enable the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. We have not prepared any appraisals and no appraisals have been prepared on our behalf of any of the Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the specific market for the Collateral, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair value and condition of the Collateral, the availability of buyers, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, as applicable. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant 44 ----- portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. In addition, the Collateral may also secure additional debt, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, which may dilute the rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to the Collateral. The value of the Collateral may be subject to significant changes in value over time due to, among other factors, economic or regulatory trends. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure investors that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation, or that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of this Collateral will be sufficient to pay the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, some or all of the Collateral may be of no value if the Group is subject to insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantor’s remaining assets.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the priority of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests in the Collateral are governed by the laws of various jurisdictions. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce on the Collateral located in a particular jurisdiction or governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction is subject to mandatory provisions of the law of such jurisdiction. Enforcement of the Collateral may also be subject to certain statutory limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements, all of which may limit its validity or enforceability. For additional information relating to limitations on enforceability of Collateral and enforcement proceedings generally, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations.”_ The security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over assets such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest, including, in some cases, certain regulatory consents. We cannot assure investors that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent or that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to enforce the Collateral. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may in the meantime significantly decrease. In addition, to the extent that any other security interests permitted under the Indenture, and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, those parties may have and may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize, sell or foreclose (in each case in accordance with the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement) on such Collateral. In addition, our business is subject to regulations and requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with applicable regulations or requirements. Particularly, the continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted following a change in ownership in an enforcement scenario. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us or the acquired in an enforcement scenario to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure investors that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are practically or commercially prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and 45 ----- the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Security interests to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be granted in Collateral located in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. Such Collateral particularly includes a pledge over the shares of the Group, which is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration, restructuring or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions or the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. An investor’s rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Collateral and the Guarantees may therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, materially affecting an investor’s ability to enforce effectively investor rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the insolvency, bankruptcy, foreign exchange, administrative and other laws of the jurisdictions of organization of the Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and, in certain circumstances, with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceedings and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply which could adversely affect an investor’s ability to enforce its rights under the Guarantees and the Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that an investor may receive. Furthermore, pursuant to EU Council Regulation No. 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the EU member state (other than Denmark) where the company has its “center of main interests.” Therefore, to the extent that the “center of main interests” of the Issuer or a Guarantor is deemed to be in a particular EU member state, the courts of such EU member state may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of such Issuer or Guarantor.

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Senior Secured Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Senior Secured Notes by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. The Indenture will provide for general limitation language to the effect that each Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability or indemnification under a Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by the relevant Guarantor or security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of the Guarantor or security provider without rendering the relevant Guarantee or security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable laws and enforcement of each Guarantee or security interest would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that relate to corporate purpose of benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, voidable preference, financial assistance, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.

The Indenture will provide, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will generally not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral may be subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring the Additional Collateral within the time periods specified. Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security interest.

Such failure may result in the invalidity of the security interest in the Collateral securing the Senior Secured 49 ----- Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. To the extent that the security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding. It should also be noted that the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to perfect the Collateral or to monitor the perfection of any security interest. For example, under Dutch law, a right of pledge over receivables can be created in two manners, by means of (i) a disclosed right of pledge which is disclosed to the debtor, or (ii) an undisclosed right of pledge. A disclosed and undisclosed right of pledge can both be created by means of a notarial deed or private deed non-notarial agreement. As a general rule under Dutch law, disclosed rights of pledge are created in respect of, inter alia, account receivables, insurance receivables, intercompany receivables and hedging receivables, while undisclosed rights of pledge are created in respect of trade receivables. A disclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment a debtor receives a notification of such right of pledge. An undisclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment that (a copy of) the agreement is submitted to the Dutch tax authorities (Belastingdienst) if such agreement is executed as a private deed or perfected at the moment of execution, if such agreement is executed as a notarial deed. For undisclosed rights of pledge over receivables, the relevant debtor may validly discharge its obligations under the relevant pledged receivable by paying the pledgor.

The granting of shared security interests (including the security interests in the Collateral), including in connection with any release and retake of such security interests, to secure existing, new or future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated, as applicable. In each such case, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations _on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ With respect to Dutch law, transactions can in certain circumstances be returned to a bankruptcy estate or a company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest or provided a guarantee that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during three or six months preceding the commencement of the relevant Dutch insolvency proceedings.

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by Upfield B.V., which is organized under the laws of the Netherlands, and may be guaranteed by entities formed or incorporated in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency event, proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom or in one or more other jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are domiciled. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of investor rights. The bankruptcy laws of these jurisdictions may be less favorable to an investor’s interests as a creditor than the bankruptcy laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction investors may be familiar with, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the ability to influence proceedings and the duration thereof, and this may limit an investor’s ability to receive payments due on the Senior Secured Notes. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer and certain other transactions, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect an investor’s ability to enforce its rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that investors may receive. In addition, in actions brought in countries outside of the United States, courts may choose to apply their own law rather than the law of the State of New York, which governs the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, investors may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, investors may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. In addition, we cannot assure that a Dutch, German or English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in the Netherlands, Germany and England and Wales. See “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.” The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in such countries of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such countries. In addition, the enforcement in such countries of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure investors that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that the Issuer would have sufficient funds, or have access to sufficient funds, to finance the repurchase of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes. The Issuer’s failure to effect a change of control offer when required would constitute an event of default under the Indenture. This could in turn trigger an event of default under the Senior Notes Indenture, Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured _Notes—Change of Control.” Additionally, the repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant to such an offer could_ cause a default under such other indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if at the time our consolidated leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.” The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford investor protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect investors, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Senior Secured Notes.

This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may adversely impact the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. _The Netherlands_ Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security rights can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim or claims which are purported to be secured by such security rights. As a consequence, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of Parallel Debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the Principal Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and other secured parties under or in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement. The Dutch law security rights will be granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will, in principle, not directly secure the Principal Obligations.

In addition, the Parallel Debt structure has not been tested under Dutch law and, to the extent that the security rights in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security rights in the Collateral.

Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Senior Secured Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of Parallel Debt obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the Principal Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. The “parallel debt” will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as such principal obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding “parallel debt” and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The pledges governed by German law will directly secure only the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the other obligations under or in connection with the Notes. The “parallel debt” mechanism is not generally recognized by German courts and to the extent that the Notes or the “parallel debt” mechanism in relation to the German law pledges (Pfandrechte) are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the German law pledges (Pfandrechte). Additionally, with respect to pledged assets under German law, German law does not generally permit for an appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event. An enforcement of a pledge governed by German law (such as, in particular, any pledges over shares in any German Guarantor) usually requires the sale of the relevant collateral through a formal disposal process involving a public auction. Certain waiting periods and notice requirements may apply to such disposal process. Thus, the disposal of pledged assets under German law will be subject to statutory restrictions and may be delayed. _England and Wales_ The creditors of the Senior Secured Notes will not have the ability to direct the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court in an English insolvency proceeding because there will not be a qualifying floating charge (meaning a floating charge over all or substantially all of the Collateral provider’s assets) granted as part of the security for the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. Unless the security for the Senior Secured Notes can be enforced as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “FCARs”), the inability of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to direct the appointment of an administrator out of court could further delay the enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the security interest of the Security Agent will be subject to practical considerations generally associated with the realization of security interests. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent or approval of a third party or governmental authority to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract or permit or transfer or sell certain assets. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any such consent or approval within a reasonable time or at all. In addition, the consents and approval of third parties and governmental authorities may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the security may significantly decrease.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks Relating to Ownership,13.4.1,The interests of the Company’s principal shareholder may conflict with your interests.,"The interests of the Company’s principal shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes. The Company is indirectly controlled by KKR. See “Principal Shareholders.” KKR is able to appoint its board of directors and to determine corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, KKR has control over decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and has the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, KKR could vote to cause the Group to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or distribute dividends, in each case, so long as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce its ability to generate net sales or, if the assets distributed or sold are Notes Collateral, could reduce the amount of the asset sale proceeds available to repay the Notes, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Notes. Additionally, KKR is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with the Group. KKR may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as KKR continues to own a significant amount of the Company’s capital stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, KKR will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. The interests of KKR may not coincide with your interests. 56 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Comparability,17.2.1,Fluctuations in Exchange Rates,"We operate internationally and, as a result, are exposed to changes in various currency exchange rates. We have exchange rate exposure in our key markets particularly in relation to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, the pound sterling, the Polish zloty, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Indonesian rupiah and the Turkish lira, in each case against the euro, which is the Group’s reporting currency. As a consequence, we have considerable cash flow, revenue, costs, assets and liabilities in foreign currencies. Our exposure to changes in exchange rates has affected our results of operations for the periods under presentation, and can mainly be described in terms of translation exposure and transaction exposure affecting the comparability of results. For instance, the significant Turkish lira depreciation was one of the main contributors in the decline of net sales in AMEA, as reported in euro, for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, the euro to pound sterling and the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates have been volatile for the periods under presentation due to various factors including the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle-East, Brexit and partially the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we also present certain metrics, such as our net sales growth, gross profit growth, operating profit growth and Normalized EBITDA growth on a constant currency basis, such that these metrics are calculated by excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and both the current and prior periods local currency values are translated into euro using prior year average exchange rates. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and “Summary— _Summary Historical and Other Financial Information.” Translation Exposure_ Translation exposure describes the risk of impact that exchange rates could have on the value of sales, costs, assets and liabilities reported in euro on our consolidated income statement and balance sheet. For example, a weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar will result in an increase in net sales as reported in euro and, conversely, the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar will result in a decrease in net sales as reported in euro. As 25.7% and 25.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, comes from the United States, these effects may be significant. We are primarily subject to translation effects with respect to non-euro revenues, costs and liabilities, as well as, non-euro goodwill and intangible assets. _Transaction Exposure_ Our exchange rate transaction risks principally relate to purchases of raw materials including Plant Oils, which may have underlying global commodity price indexes denominated in U.S. dollar or may have a degree of correlation with the U.S. dollar (despite underlying indexes being priced in euro or other currencies). We are exposed to a transaction risk since such U.S. dollar denominated raw materials are mainly invoiced to us in euro. Other ingredient and packaging costs (apart from certain commodity inputs) are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the jurisdictions in which our operations (including manufacturing plants and distribution hubs) are located, which in most cases correlate to the markets and currencies in which sales are made. To hedge against foreign currency risk, we use forward foreign currency exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps. We also manage our foreign currency risk by implementing the natural hedge of incurring indebtedness in the various principal currencies in which our turnover is denominated. As a result, we have debt service obligations denominated in U.S. dollars, pound sterling, polish zloty and euro.

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Comparability,17.2.2,Hyperinflationary Economies,"As the cumulative inflation in Turkey over the past three years has exceeded 100%, we applied hyperinflationary accounting under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 and for the three months ended March 31, 2024. IAS 29 requires that the results of our Turkish subsidiary be reported as if these were hyperinflationary as of January 1, 2022. The application of IAS 29 includes: (i) adjustment of historical cost non-monetary assets and liabilities for the change in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date, (ii) adjustment of the statement of profit or loss for inflation during the reporting period, (iii) the statement of profit or loss is translated at the period-end foreign exchange rate instead 63 ----- of an average rate and (iv) adjustment of the statement of profit or loss to reflect the impact of inflation and exchange rate movement on holding monetary assets and liabilities in local currency. As a result, a net monetary loss of €4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and of €4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as compared to nil for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and €7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively) for Turkey has been recognized in net finance costs in our consolidated statement of profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.3.1,Input Prices,"The principal ingredient in our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses are refined Plant Oils. Aside from Plant Oils, additional key inputs used in our production process include other natural ingredients, packaging materials and utility inputs such as water and energy. We obtain substantially all of our materials (which includes Plant Oils, other ingredients, flavors, finished goods from third-party manufacturers and packaging materials) from third-party suppliers, with the cost of these materials representing 67% and 68% of our total cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. Plant Oils and other ingredients prices can fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. In particular, price volatility has increased since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic with prices remaining relatively high compared to pre-pandemic levels, as well as due to the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. Although we do not source sunflower oil from Ukraine directly, as Ukraine is the world’s biggest exporter of sunflower oil, beginning the first quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the war in Ukraine caused a global shortage of sunflower oil, which in turn led to a rise in the price of sunflower oil during the year ended December 31, 2022. In response to potential sunflower oil supply chain disruptions, we utilized our “Blendflex” capability, that allows us to substitute and swap ingredients within our Plant Butters and Spreads, such as switching sunflower oil for rapeseed oil, without any impact on the taste, texture or functionality of our products. However, sunflower oil remains an important ingredient for our product portfolio. The increase in sunflower oil prices has also had a knock-on effect on the prices of other Plant Oils, including palm, rapeseed and soybean oil. In addition, palm oil has witnessed significant price swings in recent years, resulting in historically high prices during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was mainly due to slower production by the main producer nations and the adoption of a domestic market obligation policy by Indonesia, which is the world’s largest palm oil producer, in February 2022. Under the domestic market obligation policy, producers had to set aside 450,000 tonnes a month of their shipments for local buyers. This was followed by an export ban in late April 2022. Although the ban was lifted three weeks later, it created significant uncertainty in the market. Effective from May 2023, Indonesia agreed on lowering its mandatory domestic sales threshold for palm oil producers from 450,000 to 300,000 tonnes a month, allowing for more export, however volatility in the palm oil market has persisted. Other factors which have impacted the prices of Plant Oils, include their growing use as biofuel and the impact of weather patterns, in particular, El Niño (a climate pattern that is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 degrees Celsius. El Niño has now returned and is expected to last at least through the first half of 2024, according to the latest United Nations forecasts. Historically, times of El Niño have generally seen a decline in Plant Oils production growth. In addition to significant volatility in Plant Oils prices, recent periods have also seen a significant surge in energy and transportation prices, as well as the supply chain interruptions, caused by recent geopolitical and other events, including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, our inputs suppliers’ cost base has seen an adverse impact in recent periods, which they have subsequently sought to pass on to us. For example, because of the energy intensive nature of the refinery process to turn crude oils into refined oils, our Plant Oils suppliers have sought to pass on their heightened energy costs to us. All of this has exposed us in turn to significantly higher Plant Oils, packaging, energy costs, and as a consequence thereof, higher manufacturing, logistics and transportation costs, which we may not be able to effectively hedge or fully pass on to our customers. To manage our input costs, we regularly monitor global market prices and enter into a combination of fixed contracts and commodity derivatives to protect against volatility. With this approach, through a combination of hedging and fixed price contracts, we generally had price visibility on approximately 77% of our total cost of sales on a rolling six month basis, or 49% of our total cost of sales on a rolling 12 month basis, in each case as of March 31, 2024. We use commodity derivatives (futures, over the counter and tradable forward contracts) to hedge against commodity price risk in respect of the major Plant Oils we purchase, as well as certain packaging materials and utilities. Our policy is to hedge 64 ----- the majority of the risk within the relevant pricing window. The extent of hedging is determined on an ongoing and on a country and/or region basis, depending on hedging volumes and the pricing horizon. Our hedging ratio increases when the exposure/volatility is higher and the pricing window is shorter. All of our commodity derivative contracts hedge future purchases of Plant Oils, certain packaging materials and utilities on a three to six months rolling basis. This hedging policy allows us to weather short term price movements and gives our sales teams time to price accordingly, taking into account the typical cycle of customer negotiation windows (typically, annually and semi-annually in Europe and North America, and less then semi-annually in LatAm and AMEA). Our hedging policy is implemented by our in-house commodity risk management team, and while we do not take speculative views on the market, we monitor our position regularly in line with our in-house team’s assessment. While we generally operate within this policy, in circumstances where it is recommended by our specialist commodity risk management team and approved by our executive risk committee, which consists of senior members of management, we can take longer hedging positions in exceptional circumstances. Due to our Plant Oils inventories and hedging arrangements, a change in the cost of our Plant Oils can take between three to six months to be fully realized in our cost of sales. In response to the significant inflation experienced across our primary inputs in Plant Oils, packaging materials, energy, manufacturing and logistics over the reporting period, particularly in 2021 and 2022, we also increased our pricing through a number of pricing waves, with the last such pricing wave implemented in July 2022. We typically seek to negotiate our pricing with our customers in Europe and North America on an annual basis, and we do so in LatAm and AMEA on a semi-annual or more ad-hoc basis, depending on the increase in cost base and the relationship with retailers and distributors in such market. In addition, with a view to maintaining our profitability and margins, which were impacted as a result of such inflation, we continued other value protection measures such as our value creation program, which focuses on making our business more efficient from an operational perspective and in particular through supply chain areas including, amongst others, procurement, manufacturing and portfolio simplification. Pursuant to the value creation program, we achieved approximately €90 million of savings measured at constant currency, representing 4.4% of our cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since the inception of Upfield in July 2018, we have achieved a total of approximately €415 million in savings measured at constant currency through our value creation program and similar initiatives. The continued recovery of our margin throughout 2022 and 2023 reflects the time lag between the implementation of our pricing initiatives (particularly during the year ended December 31, 2022) and the impact of inflation across our key inputs. Inflationary pressures have persisted throughout 2022 and 2023, and we remain exposed to fluctuations in the prices of our key inputs. Our ability to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations through the pricing of our products will need to be balanced against competitive dynamics in our various regions.

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.3.2,Changes in Food Trends and Consumer Preferences,"There are a number of changing consumer trends, demands and preferences which have an effect on both our Group and the industry in which we operate. These include, dietary, health and environmental concerns and trends, such as increasing awareness of different nutritional aspects of foods and the health effects and sourcing practices relating to specific ingredients, an increasing preference for dairy-free, vegan and organic food ingredients, trends towards eating and baking outside of home and concerns regarding public health consequences associated with obesity and increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of production (in particular those related to palm oil, which is a key ingredient in many products across our portfolio). The food industry, particularly in developed markets and with respect to unhealthier foods and high-fat, sweet and salty options, could also face a softer demand in the coming years because of obesity medicines decreasing appetite and reducing daily calorie intake. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our _Business and Industry—Changes in food trends and consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.”_ Currently there is an increasing trend of consumers across markets preferring non-dairy plant-based products as a result of the increasing awareness of lactose-intolerance health issues, high carbon footprint and the environmental impact of dairy consumption. Consumers are increasingly prioritizing environmentally friendly product choices due to heightened concerns about climate change, with plant-based options being favored for their lower CO₂ emissions, reduced resource consumption, and longer shelf life. Environmentally friendly packaging is also gaining importance, with a preference for all-paper solutions to reduce plastic usage. With initiatives like the world’s first plastic-free, recyclable tub for our Flora Plant brand and patented palm-oil free products, we believe that our product offering strongly aligns with these consumer trends. In the dairy category, health-conscious consumers are also increasingly turning to low-cholesterol, trans-fat-free options like our plant-based products. For example, our Plant Butter and Spreads have a number of health and environmental advantages over dairy butter, such as higher Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid concentrations, zero trans-fat and lower saturated fat content. See also “Industry—Key Trends.” However, this growing trend towards plant-based alternatives may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, such as misconceptions about “highly processed” plant-based foods, perceived “naturalness” of dairy and increased 65 ----- regulatory control of the plant-based sector. In addition, there has been negative press coverage in recent years as regards products made from palm oil due to both health and environmental concerns. For example, among our key markets, Spain and the Netherlands in particular, have seen a greater negative press coverage and perception as regards use of palm oil based products. In response thereto, we created a patented palm oil-free technology and we have shifted our focus on offering alternatives to palm oil in some of our markets. Although we source certified (segregated and mass balance) palm oil and offer palm oil-free options in a number of markets, there is a risk that additional press coverage and the resulting negative consumer perception of products made from palm oil further escalates. Although we recognize the controversy around palm oil as an ingredient and continue to innovate and create new recipes both with sustainable palm oil and alternatives to palm oil through our patented palm oil-free technology, some of our products contain palm oil and switching to exclusively palm oil-free products may not be currently technically feasible. In addition, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the conflict in the Middle East, the global markets and economy have experienced significant uncertainty. There has been a sharp rise in energy and food costs, resulting in inflationary macroeconomic conditions across most major economies and markets where we operate. Given these economic conditions, there has been a significant decline in disposable incomes of many households, creating a cost of living crisis, that has altered the purchasing habits of consumers. In these circumstances, consumers may choose to economize by purchasing non-branded or private–label brands, which may be cheaper than our products. A reduction in consumer disposable income could foster a move by our customers towards discounters and non-branded products, which would impact our market share and adversely affect our net sales. Aside from affecting our net sales, lower sales volumes also reduce the rate of cost absorption, meaning that in periods where key input costs are higher, margins are adversely impacted to a greater degree than would otherwise be the case. We have consistently operated with a clear approach to fluctuations in commodity and packaging costs in regards to procurement and hedging policies and, as a result, have been able to maintain strong levels of profitability after direct costs in changing cost environments. Moreover, our ability to effectively leverage our product development expertise to continually update our portfolio in response to changing consumer tastes, especially with the development of innovative premium products, is a key element of our strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.3.3,Customer Pricing,"“Customer pricing” refer to prices that we charge to retailers. We do not set the prices that retailers charge to end-use consumers. The prices paid by our customers for our products are a key driver of our financial results and are affected by a number of external factors. Pricing is mostly driven by the terms we agree with our major retail customers. We typically conduct annual negotiations with most of our large retail customers in key markets in Europe and North America in respect of the supply and pricing of our products in the first quarter of the year. Negotiations in AMEA and LatAm can take place semi-annually or more frequently in some cases. These agreements, often referred to as “joint business plans,” usually encompass pricing, trade terms, support for new innovation, assortment, distribution and shelf space. In some markets, the agreements also include promotional activity for the year, although in most markets it is still possible to change promotional activity and pricing during the year. In 2021 and 2022, on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated supply chain disruption and the inflationary environment, these discussions took place on a more frequent basis and in some cases pricing negotiations were prolonged. The impact of such prolonged negotiations saw us stop shipments to certain customers during the discussions, which had an impact on financial performance during such period. While there was no material lasting impact on financial performance, there can be no assurance that similar issues will not arise in future years given the competitive dynamics of our industry. In territories where resale price maintenance is not permitted, retailers remain free at all times to set levels of retail pricing, which depends on a number of factors, including retailer margin, demand for our products among consumers and the relative affordability of our products as compared to competing products (which may be particularly relevant given the ongoing cost of living crisis in a number of markets where we offer our products). In particular, the consumer prices of and demand for our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses products may also be influenced by a substitution effect with the market price of competing dairy products including butter, cream and cheese. Butter price increased significantly between 2021 and 2023, driven by factors including higher costs of energy and fertilisers, which we believe has had a positive effect on the relative prices of our products.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The extent and impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which we operate. For example, the U.S. business typically experiences a spike in the fourth quarter of the year which is driven by Thanksgiving and Christmas baking. Similarly, there can be some seasonality in sales in Europe and the Americas owing to Easter, which can occur 66 ----- during the first or second quarter of the year. Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak in butter and spreads usage for cooking and baking during the Ramadan festival season, which can occur in various quarters from year to year. Furthermore, across all the countries in which we operate, the timing of product promotions drives volatility from normal consumption. While our sales are seasonal, many of our costs, such as personnel costs, are incurred more evenly throughout the year, which could affect measures of profitability in the short term and put pressure on our working capital position. In addition, for these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a reliable indication of the performance of our business or how we may perform in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Our organic net sales decline of 6.3% was primarily pricing-led, with a negative pricing contribution of 5.1%, and negative volume/mix contribution of 1.2%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our negative pricing contribution reflects targeted price reductions on certain SKUs, primarily in Europe and the Americas. Our negative volume/mix contribution of 1.2% showed an improving trend compared to the first, second and fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023. Set forth below is a breakdown of our reported net sales, reported net sales decline, organic net sales growth/(decrease), pricing contribution and volume/mix contribution by operating segments, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which are discussed in further detail:",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” Europe_ Our net sales in Europe decreased by €34 million or 8.4% from €405 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €371 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our organic net sales in Europe declined by 9.1%. Our organic net sales decline reflects a negative pricing contribution of 7.5% and a negative volume/mix contribution of 1.6%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our negative pricing contribution reflects targeted price reductions on certain SKUs in certain markets during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The negative volume/mix contribution in Europe showed an improving trend compared to each of the prior quarters of the year ended December 31, 2023, with some key markets in Europe including the Netherlands and Germany returning to volume growth following targeted price reductions initiated during the year ended December 31, 2023. Positive volume/mix contribution in the Netherlands was also supported by increased household penetration of plant-based butter under our BlueBand brand, following the launch of our “Skip The Cow” campaign. The United Kingdom delivered a stable volume performance with particularly strong performance in the Creams category. Volume growth in Austria was backed by our Plant Butter and Spreads and Plant Creams, with the volume growth of our Plant Butter also supported by the rollout of paper packaging under our Flora Plant brand. 69 ----- _Americas_ Our net sales in Americas decreased by €18 million or 5.5% from €325 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €307 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our organic net sales in the Americas declined by 6.2%. Our organic net sales decline reflects a negative pricing contribution of 3.7% and a negative volume/mix contribution of 2.5%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our negative pricing contribution reflects targeted price reductions on certain SKUs in certain markets. The negative volume/mix contribution in the Americas was primarily due to some customer destocking in key markets in the Americas, including the United States, Canada and Mexico during the three months ended March 31, 2024 which impacted volumes through the quarter, but all three markets ended the period in volume growth. Volume growth in Colombia was mainly due to the growing market share of our Rama brand in the country. _AMEA_ Our net sales in AMEA decreased by €14 million or 12.8% from €109 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €95 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Foreign exchange rate drove a large part of the decline, with the Turkish lira depreciation as the main contributor, further strengthened by additional impacts from inscope changes. These in-scope changes principally reflected the sale of our West Africa business in April 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our organic net sales growth in AMEA was 5.1%. Our organic net sales growth in AMEA of 5.1% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 0.4% and a positive volume/mix contribution of 4.7%, in each case, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the continued strong inflationary environment in Turkey, offset by targeted price reductions on certain SKUs in other markets to address local competitive dynamics. The positive volume/mix contribution of 4.7% was led by Turkey reflecting volume growth across our Plant Spreads and our Plant Creams, as well as volume growth in Indonesia. Positive volume/mix contribution was also supported by steady performance from smaller, growth markets including Australia, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region. Our foodservice business continues to perform strongly with a broad-based positive volume/mix contribution across key and nascent growth markets, with particularly strong performance in the creams category.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic net sales growth was 1.2%. As discussed above under “—Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March _31, 2023,” our management believes that the drivers of our organic net sales growth/(decrease) which we commenced_ calculating beginning the year ended December 31, 2023 (and which are discussed below) were the key indicators as to the underlying performance of our business for the relevant year as compared to the prior period. For the periods under discussion, the difference between our organic net sales and reported net sales was primarily due to movements in foreign exchange, especially in the AMEA region, and the impact from the change in scope in the AMEA region as discussed below. Our organic net sales growth of 1.2% was primarily pricing-led, with a positive pricing contribution of 6.5%, partially offset by a negative volume/mix contribution of 5.3%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the annualized impact of previously implemented price increases in the first half of 2023, as well as limited price and promotional reductions on certain SKUs in certain markets during the second half of 71 ----- the year ended December 31, 2023. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our pricing, as well as certain product portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and certain other selfdirected initiatives implemented by us during the year which mainly impacted our organic net sales growth in Europe. We implemented these initiatives so as to continue with our portfolio improvement and rationalization program to improve our product offering to customers and consumers and further optimize our operations. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of such product portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and certain other selfdirected initiatives, our volume/mix contribution was a negative 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023. However, during the year ended December 31, 2023, our foodservice business contributed positively to our net sales. Set forth below is a breakdown of our reported net sales, reported net sales growth/(decrease), organic net sales growth/(decrease), pricing contribution, volume/mix contribution and underlying volume/mix contribution by operating segments, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are discussed in further detail:",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic net sales in Europe declined by 3.4%. Our organic net sales decline reflects a positive pricing contribution of 6.0%, offset by a negative volume/mix contribution of 9.4%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the annualized impact of previously implemented price increases (from the second half of 2022) in the first half of 2023, as well as limited price reductions in certain markets, including the Netherlands, Germany and Poland in the second half of 2023. The decline in volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the strong competition from dairy players in key retail markets in Europe, including the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. In addition, the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and other self-directed initiatives implemented by us during the year ended December 31, 2023, were predominantly weighted towards Europe, which negatively impacted our volume/mix performance in this region. During the year ended December 31, 2023, several key European markets delivered organic net sales growth, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and Hungary. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization, renovation and other self-directed initiatives, our volume/mix contribution in Europe was negative 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Overall, underlying volume/mix trends progressively improved across the year as strategic initiatives implemented by us took effect and a significant portion of the price increases implemented by us was accepted in the market. Our foodservice business, recorded a net sales growth in Europe led by key markets including Sweden, Poland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. _Americas_ Our net sales in Americas increased by €46 million or 3.6% from €1,273 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €1,319 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic net sales growth in the Americas was 6.0%. Our organic net sales growth in the Americas of 6.0% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 8.3%, partially offset by a negative volume/mix contribution of 2.3%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the annualized impact of previously implemented price increases (from the second half of 2022) in the first half of 2023, as well as limited price reductions in the second half of 2023 in certain markets, including Mexico. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our pricing in key retail markets in the Americas, including Canada and Mexico alongside some negative impact from our supply chain activities 72 ----- in the Americas region, partially offset by positive volume/mix contribution in Colombia and Brazil. In addition, the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and other self-directed initiatives implemented by us during the year ended December 31, 2023, as discussed above, also negatively impacted our volume/mix performance in this region. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization, renovation and other self-directed initiatives discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in the Americas was a negative 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the United States, we recorded stable to growing volumes across all our key product categories. In particular, our brands Country Crock and Imperial both gained share in the butters and spreads market, while Violife further strengthened its market leadership position in the plant-based cheese market. Canada and Mexico both recorded volume growth in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2023. Elsewhere in LatAm, volume trends were more varied during the year ended December 31, 2023, with Brazil and Colombia recording volume growth. _AMEA_ Our net sales in AMEA decreased by €84 million or 19.0% from €441 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €357 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Foreign exchange rate drove a large part of the decline, with the Turkish lira depreciation as the main contributor, further strengthened by additional impact from scope changes. These scope changes principally reflected the sale of our West Africa business in April 2023, alongside our business model changes in Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Japan. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our organic net sales growth in AMEA was 5.7%. Our organic net sales growth in AMEA of 5.7% was relatively evenly split across both pricing and positive volume/mix contribution, with a positive pricing contribution of 2.7% and a positive volume/mix contribution of 3.0%. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the annualized impact of previously implemented price increases (from the second half of 2022) in the first half of 2023, as well as limited price reductions in the second half of 2023 to address competitive dynamics in certain markets, such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka. The positive volume/mix contribution was led by Turkey and Indonesia, alongside volume growth in some of our smaller markets, such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region. Our foodservice business showed continued growth led by Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, with strong performance in the creams category. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade, rationalization, renovation and other self-directed initiatives, our volume/mix contribution in AMEA was 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales decreased by €199 million, or 8.9%, from €2,228 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €2,029 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the price of Plant Oils, during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the historically high prices of such Plant Oils during the year ended December 31, 2022 and a negative volume/mix contribution of 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023. _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €99 million, or 8.6%, from €1,147 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €1,246 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. On a constant currency basis, our gross profit increased by 10.6%, which is mainly attributable to the positive impact of the pricing initiatives implemented by us and savings pursuant to the value creation program, partially offset by continued inflation across both commodities (net of hedging) and other costs of sales. _Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_ Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by €77 million, or 10.2%, from €753 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €676 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non-underlying costs during the year ended December 31, 2023, including a decrease in supply chain restructuring costs following the sale of our manufacturing facilities in Canada and the Netherlands in the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as a decrease in impairment costs, partially offset by an increase in advertising and promotion expenses and other overhead costs. Non-underlying costs are costs that relate to activities that are not considered to be part of our daily business operations, due to the nature, frequency and predictability of their occurrence, including, but not limited to, business transformation, corporate actions and strategic initiatives, restructuring costs and impairments. 73 ----- _Other Income_ During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold two manufacturing sites, one in Canada and one in the Netherlands, as well as land in Greece. As a result hereof, we recognized a gain of €59 million as other income. No such other income was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023. _Operating Profit_ Operating profit increased by €117 million, or 25.8%, from €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €570 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Alongside the gross profit drivers (as described above under “— _Gross Profit”), operating profit also benefited from the reduction in non-underlying costs, mainly driven by a reduction_ in restructuring costs and lower impairments. _Net Finance Costs_ Net finance costs increased by €260 million, or 88.1% from €295 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €555 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in our finance cost. Our finance costs increased by €232 million, or 65.9% from €352 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €584 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i) the amendments to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023, and pursuant to such amendments, we recognized an additional €28 million of transaction costs and a loss of €37 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, (ii) higher interest payments on the Senior Credit Facilities as a result of higher interest rates and (iii) a net foreign exchange gain of €44 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €16 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. _Income Tax Expense_ Taxation increased by €41 million, or 51.3%, from €80 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €121 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This was mainly driven by improved operational results which led to an increase in current year income tax expense, as well as an increase in non-recognition of deferred tax assets relating to interest carry forward and foreign tax credits. _Net (Loss)/Profit_ As a result of the foregoing factors, we reported a net loss of €106 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a net profit of €78 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant currency net sales growth was 18.5%. Our constant currency net sales growth represents the change in net sales for the relevant period compared to the prior period, calculated on a constant currency basis. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” Our management believes for the periods under discussion, the drivers of our constant currency net sales growth (which are discussed below) were the key indicators as to the underlying performance of our business. For the periods under discussion, the difference between our constant currency net sales and reported net sales is due to movements in foreign exchange, in particular the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Our constant currency net sales growth of 18.5% was primarily pricing-led, with a positive pricing contribution of 29.0%, partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 10.5%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our positive pricing contribution reflects (i) the impact of price increases we realized during the year ended December 31, 2022, which involved a number of pricing waves implemented by us between 2021 and the second quarter of 2022 (the last one being implemented in July 2022) and (ii) the impact of certain portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions and other self-directed initiatives implemented by us during the year ended December 31, 2022, whereby we removed certain unprofitable and low value-added products and replaced them with new product innovations. Negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to (i) the impact on volume due to the increase in pricing, (ii) the impact on volume due to certain portfolio upgrade, rationalization and renovation actions referred to above, (iii) the impact of our net revenue management initiatives and (iv) the impact of price pack architecture actions; partially offset by the positive impact on volumes due to limited price reductions which we implemented during the year ended December 31, 2022. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives, our volume/mix contribution was negative at 6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Set forth below is a breakdown of our reported net sales, reported net sales growth, constant currency net sales growth, pricing contribution, volume/mix contribution and underlying volume/mix contribution by operating segments, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are discussed in further detail:",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” Europe_ Our net sales in Europe increased by €223 million or 15.5% from €1,438 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €1,661 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant currency net sales growth in Europe was 16.0%. Our constant currency net sales growth in Europe of 16.0% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 26.0%, partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 10.0%, in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the impact of price increases we implemented during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, which were in response to the significant inflation experienced across our 75 ----- primary inputs. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the negative impact of the increase in our pricing in key retail markets in Europe, especially in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and volume reduction related to the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives implemented by us during the year ended December 31, 2022. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in Europe was a negative 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our foodservice business recorded a strong net sales growth in Europe primarily due to growth in the United Kingdom, Spain and Poland driven by additional customer contracts entered into by us. _Americas_ Our net sales in Americas increased by €324 million or 34.1% from €949 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €1,273 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant currency net sales growth in the Americas was 20.2%. Our constant currency net sales growth in the Americas of 20.2% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 28.9%, partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 8.7%. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the impact of price increases we implemented during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, which were in response to the significant inflation experienced across our primary inputs, particularly in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our pricing in key retail markets in the Americas, including the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition, the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives discussed above also negatively impacted our volume/mix performance in this region. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of the product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in the Americas was a negative 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the United States we continued to grow our share (based on value of sales) in the Butters and Spreads category, primarily due to the continued strong performance of our brand Country Crock, our renovated portfolio, relatively stable volumes and strong customer relationships. Across LatAm we experienced strong growth on a price-led basis, with continued momentum in key markets such as Mexico, Brazil and Central America through 2022. Our brand Violife consolidated its leadership position in the plant-based cheese category in the United States, gradually growing its share, driven by the continued expansion of distribution to our key nationwide customers. _AMEA_ Our net sales in AMEA increased by €35 million or 8.6% from €406 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €441 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our constant currency net sales growth in AMEA was 23.1%. Our constant currency net sales growth in AMEA of 23.1% reflects a positive pricing contribution of 39.7%, partially offset by negative volume/mix contribution of 16.6%. Our positive pricing contribution reflects the impact of price increases we implemented during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31, 2021, which were in response to the significant inflation experienced across our primary inputs. Positive pricing contribution across the region was driven primarily by Turkey, South and Central Asia and Australia and New Zealand. The negative volume/mix contribution was primarily due to the impact of the increase in our pricing, especially in Indonesia, and volume reduction related to the portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives discussed above. On an underlying basis, and excluding the impact of product portfolio upgrade and transformation initiatives discussed above, our volume/mix contribution in AMEA was a negative 9.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our foodservice business recorded a strong net sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 in AMEA and continued to see positive growth momentum and stabilized its performance in the region following the disruption caused due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2021. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by €432 million, or 24.1%, from €1,796 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €2,228 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the significant increase in the price of Plant Oils, reaching historically high prices during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cost of sales was partially offset by savings of €86 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, pursuant to the value creation program implemented by us. 76 ----- _Gross Profit_ Gross profit increased by €150 million, or 15.0%, from €997 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €1,147 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. On a constant currency basis, our gross profit increased by 12.4%, which is mainly attributable to the positive impact of the pricing initiatives implemented by us and savings pursuant to the value creation program, partially offset by continued inflation across both commodities (net of hedging) and other cost of sales. _Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_ Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by €44 million, or 6.2%, from €709 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €753 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotion expenses and employee costs, partially offset by lower non-underlying costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 2021. Non-underlying costs are costs that relate to activities that are not considered to be part of our daily business operations, due to the nature, frequency and predictability of their occurrence, including, but not limited to, business transformation, corporate actions and strategic initiatives, restructuring costs and impairments. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information— _Key Financial Data” for details of the non-underlying costs incurred by us during the years ended December 31, 2021_ and 2022. _Other Income_ During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold two manufacturing sites, one in Canada and one in the Netherlands, as well as land in Greece. As a result hereof, we recognized a gain of €59 million as other income. No such other income was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021. _Operating Profit_ Operating profit increased by €165 million, or 57.3%, from €288 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Alongside the gross profit drivers (as described above under “— _Gross Profit”), operating profit also benefited from optimization of our selling, general and administrative expenses, as_ well as a reduction in non-underlying costs mainly driven by a reduction in restructuring and business transformation costs. _Net Finance Costs_ Net finance costs decreased by €23 million, or 7.2%, from €318 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €295 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to a net foreign exchange gain of €44 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €65 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by higher interest payments on the Senior Credit Facilities during the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of higher interest rates. _Income Tax Expense_ Taxation decreased by €81 million, or 50.3%, from €161 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €80 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreased non-recognition of deferred tax assets, which relates to interest carry forward, foreign tax credits and net operating losses. _Net Profit/(Loss)_ As a result of the foregoing factors, we reported a net profit of €78 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to a net loss of €191 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.31,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.31.1,Liquidity,"Liquidity describes our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by our cash from operating activities, including our net negative working capital position, and our financings. Our principal liquidity requirements arise from the need to settle supplier payables and fund our ongoing operations. During the periods under review, the 77 ----- liquidity needs of the business were mainly funded from cash from operations (including our net negative working capital position) and borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility. Our business is cash generative and during the periods under review we benefited from a negative cash conversion cycle, driven by longer credit terms received on purchases from our suppliers compared to those offered to our customers. After the consummation of the Transactions, we will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2024, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have outstanding €5,768 million (equivalent) in aggregate indebtedness (excluding the principal amount of lease liabilities recognized by us under IFRS 16 (Leases)), with an additional €567 million of borrowing capacity available under our Revolving Credit Facility. To meet these additional liquidity needs going forward, we expect our sources of liquidity will consist mainly of the following: - cash generated from our operating activities; - borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility; - issuances of debt securities; and - borrowings under other loan facilities. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity needs, working capital requirements and debt service obligations for the next twelve months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund all of our other projected liquidity needs. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which could be due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole; - increased commodity costs which we cannot pass onto customers; - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings which bear interest at a variable rate, including our Senior Term Facilities and our Revolving Credit Facility; - changes in trade terms, consumer preferences or market conditions which might imperil our ability to maintain a net negative working capital position consistent with past practice; and - higher capital expenditure, such as due to higher than expected expenses incurred in connection with our product innovation and growth strategies. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinancing all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, limit, and the terms of the Notes, will limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The Group benefits from a negative cash conversion cycle, driven by longer credit terms received on purchases from its suppliers compared to those offered to its customers. Particularly in Europe and North America, trade receivables are net of trade term rebates and trade payable days are significantly longer than inventory and receivables days. Historically, we have managed our trade payables on typically 90 to 120 day terms and managed our receivables on typically 30 day terms. We also offer additional discounts to customers in many markets for “prompt payment,” which is defined as payment in less than 30 days. Our negative cash conversion largely is a structural feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and finished product markets in which we operate, and while there are some risks to our ability to maintain our working capital cycle on precisely these terms going forward this cycle is not expected to shift fundamentally in the future. This cycle is also a result of our operational efficiency with respect to our inventory management. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We are _subject to credit risk with respect to our customers and suppliers.”_ The change in working capital for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was an outflow of €114 million, compared to an outflow of €117 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by a combination of typical seasonal effects, deflationary effects on payables, alongside some timing impacts on receivables. The change in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2023 was an outflow of €71 million, compared to an inflow of €44 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The outflow in 2023 was driven by a decrease in payables reflecting deflationary effects, the impact of commodity hedging, and, to a lesser extent, bonus impacts. The change in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2022 was an inflow of €44 million, compared to an inflow of €86 million for the year ended 31 December 2021. The lower inflow in 2022 was driven by a combination of higher inventories, reflecting the decision to carry higher safety stocks, and higher receivables, reflecting inflationary effects. The working capital inflow of €86 million for the year ended 2021 is as derived from our consolidated statement of cash flows, and consists of a sum of inventories (negative €18 million), trade receivables (€73 million), other receivables (€79 million), trade payables (€54 million) and other liabilities (negative €85 million), and, to align with the presentation adopted by us for periods subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2021, further considering the outflow for the increase in provisions for the year ended December 31, 2021 (€17 million).",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

See also note 1.7 (Adjustments For Comparative Purposes) of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in this Offering Memorandum. Net cash flow from operating activities_ Net cash from operating activities increased by €40 million, from €32 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €72 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was mainly driven by the increase in operating profit. Net cash from operating activities increased by €19 million, or 3.2%, from €588 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €607 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was mainly driven by the increase in operating profit during the period, partially offset by working capital effects and higher tax payments. Net cash from operating activities increased by €32 million, or 5.8%, from €556 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €588 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was mainly driven by the increase in operating profit during the period. _Net Cash Used in Investing Activities_ Net cash used in investing activities decreased by €6 million, or 33.3%, from €18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was mainly driven by interest income received by us, a deferred consideration of €1 million received in relation to the sale of our business in West Africa on March 31, 2023 and the absence of equity investments during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities increased by €48 million, or 60.0%, from €80 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €128 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by (i) higher net capital expenditure as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, where we benefited from the sale of two manufacturing sites (one in Canada and one in the Netherlands), as well as the sale of land in Greece, (ii) a payment of €57 million of deferred contingent consideration to Arivia related to the consideration associated with the acquisition of Arivia in January 2020 and (iii) share-based payments to Arivia employees through the cash settled equity incentive plan. This increase was partially offset by a refund of VAT in Indonesia of €33 million. Net cash used in investing activities increased by €12 million, or 17.6%, from €68 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €80 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was driven by a payment of €35 million of deferred contingent consideration to Arivia, related to the consideration associated with the acquisition of Arivia in January 2020. The increase was partially offset by a VAT refund in Mexico of €30 million (excluding interest) from a business acquisition, received during the year ended December 31, 2021. _Net Cash Used in Financing Activities_ Net cash used in financing activities increased by €133 million, from €42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €175 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which is mainly driven by higher interest 79 ----- payments due to higher interest rates, repayments made by us and payment of certain refinancing fees, in each case, in relation to the Senior Term Facilities and/or the Revolving Credit Facility. Net cash used in financing activities decreased by €120 million, or 24.2%, from €496 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €376 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to higher net proceeds received by us under the Senior Term Facilities pursuant to a refinancing thereunder, which was partially offset by higher interest payments due to higher interest rates pursuant to refinancing and the payment of certain refinancing fees, in each case, in relation to the Senior Term Facilities. Net cash used in financing activities decreased by €150 million, or 23.2%, from €646 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €496 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by a lower repayment on the Revolving Credit Facility compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as proceeds received from the settlement of foreign exchange derivatives.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

As of December 31, 2023, we had over 2,590 customers across 56 subsidiaries with the top 50 customers 80 ----- accounting for approximately 48% of all the receivables outstanding. Not one of our individual customers had a concentration of more than 4% of the outstanding trade receivable balance. Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortized cost. The fair values of trade and other current receivables are not considered to be significantly different from their carrying values. We have a non-recourse factoring arrangement with a financial institution. As part of the arrangement, we transfer our eligible trade receivables to the financial institution and receive an initial part of the transferred receivables. The legal title and rights to the factored receivables have been passed to the financial institution, therefore the control of the factored receivables has been transferred. The transferred receivables are derecognized for the amount that is initially factored with the remaining amounts of the transferred receivables maintained on our balance sheet.

The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable costs. In doing this, management considers both normal and stressed conditions. A material and sustained shortfall in cash flow could undermine the Group’s credit rating, impair investor confidence and also restrict the Group’s ability to raise funds.

We are exposed to credit risk from our operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from our financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institution and treasury instruments. Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a Group basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. We have not entered into credit default derivatives. To reduce this risk, we have concentrated our main activities with a number of counterparties which have secure credit ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counterparty based on financial position, credit rating and past experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by our treasury department. Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on a credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and any shipments to major customers are generally covered by letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance obtained from reputable banks and other financial institutions. As of December 31, 2023, we had over 2,590 customers across 56 subsidiaries with the top 50 customers accounting for approximately 48% of all the receivables outstanding. Not one of our individual customers had a concentration of more than 4% of the outstanding trade receivable balance. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Generally, trade receivables are written off if past due for more than one year and are not subject to enforcement activity. The letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance are considered integral part of trade receivables and considered in the calculation of impairment. We evaluate the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as our customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The Group’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: - Commodity price risk: the Group is exposed to the risk of changes in commodity prices in relation to its purchase of certain raw materials. The key commodities used by us are Plant Oils. We use commodity derivatives (future, over the counter and tradable forward contract contracts) to hedge against this risk. Our policy is to hedge the majority of the risk within the relevant pricing window. The extend of hedging is determined on an ongoing basis on a country and/or region basis, based on hedging volumes (open exposure) and the pricing horizon. The hedging ratio increases when the exposure is higher and the window 83 ----- is shorter. All commodity derivative contracts hedge future purchases of Plant Oils, packaging materials and utilities on a three to six months rolling basis and contracts are settled either in cash or by physical delivery. - Currency risk: the Group’s reporting currency is the euro. Our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates to operating activities (sales and purchases), borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives against the functional currencies of the Group companies. The main currencies that give rise to currency risk are the U.S. dollar, pound sterling and the Polish zloty and the foreign denominated loans in these currencies. We are also subject to currency risk in relation to the translation of the net investments of our foreign operations into euros for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. We manage foreign exchange exposures by transacting as much as possible in the currencies where the operations are situated. Remaining risks are managed within reasonable limits, mainly using forward foreign currency exchange contracts. The aim of our approach to management of currency risk is to minimize foreign currency risk with consideration of the cost to enter into hedge instruments. We do not hedge the currency risk in relation to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. - Interest rate risk: the Group is exposed to market interest rate fluctuations on its floating rate debt. Increases in benchmark interest rates could increase the interest cost of floating-rate debt and increase the cost of future borrowings. Our ability to manage interest costs also has an impact on reported results. Our interest rate risk management approach aims for an optimal balance between fixed and floating-rate interest rate exposures on expected net debt. The objective of this approach is to minimize annual interest costs after tax and to reduce volatility. This is achieved either by issuing fixed or floating-rate long-term debt, or by modifying interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate derivatives, such as swaps, caps and collars. The above risks may affect the Group’s income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The Group’s objective in managing market risk is to maintain this risk within acceptable parameters, while optimizing returns.

The current global food system is unsustainable: If the diets of G20 nations were adopted worldwide by 2050, it is expected that we would require up to seven planets to support us. Furthermore, the global population is expected to grow by over two billion over the next 30 years while 9.2% of the global population faced hunger in 2022. There is acute focus by governments worldwide on prioritising food security and ensuring that significant increases in demand for food resources can be met. In addition, 38 million square kilometres, approximately 36% of habitable land globally, are currently used for livestock, despite meat and dairy overall representing a low proportion of our daily calorific intake, which thus represents a relatively inefficient use of space for a growing population. Plant-based crops feed more people while occupying less land. Plant-based food uses only 16% of global agricultural land, yet provides 83% of our calories; harnessing this efficiency would feed a 2050 world more sustainably. Plant-based dairy alternatives are the more sustainable option to meet increased food requirements as plant crops require less land, water and other resources than dairy cows. In particular, plant-based dairy alternatives result in significantly reduced GHG emissions and eliminate the methane emissions from animals (approximately 9% of global GHG emissions can be attributed to cattle). Compared to their dairy equivalents, Upfield’s (i) Plant Butters and Spreads contribute 70% less CO₂ emissions and need 66% less land and 50% less water, (ii) Plant Creams contribute 50% less CO₂ emissions and (iii) Plant Cheeses contribute 74% less CO₂ emissions and overall have less than half the climate footprint. Increasingly, consumers are seeking more environmentally friendly product choices because of heightened concern over the environment and climate change. Plant-based products contribute less CO₂ emissions, require fewer resources to produce and have a longer shelf life thereby reducing waste. This is a priority across generations, with 50% of consumers saying they restrict their dairy consumption. Furthermore, retailers named GHG emissions as the number 87 ----- one key ESG topic on which they evaluate their suppliers. More environmentally friendly packaging is also an increasingly key purchasing criteria, with consumers seeking to reduce their plastic usage through all-paper packaging solutions. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand, with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in early 2024. Furthermore, Upfield has taken proactive steps in order to address consumer concerns regarding both health risks of palm oil and its historical association with deforestation. In response, it has created a patented palm oil-free technology and shifted its focus on offering alternatives to palm oil in select markets where consumer sentiment leans towards avoiding palm oil due to health concerns. Since 2019, Upfield has transitioned to sourcing certified (segregated and mass balance) palm oil, underscoring its commitment to sustainability and actively mitigating the impact of deforestation. In 2023, Upfield achieved an outstanding score of 8.5 (out of 10) on the RSPO’s Shared Responsibility Scorecard, placing Upfield in the top 4% of companies demonstrating sustainable leadership in palm oil sourcing. Upfield continuously explores novel recipes utilizing sustainable palm oil and alternative ingredients through its patented palm oil-free technology.

There is increased focus on clean-label products with formulations and traceable natural ingredients, which 33% of EU consumers look for. The food industry, particularly in developed markets and with respect to unhealthier foods and high-fat, sweet and salty options, could also face a softer demand in the coming years because of obesity medicines decreasing appetite and reducing daily calorie intake, thereby driving consumers who are taking obesity medication to healthier options. Upfield’s products are focused on a limited number of natural ingredients: for example, Upfield’s Plant Butter only contains six to seven natural ingredients without the artificial ingredients historically used in the spreads industry. Within the dairy category in particular, consumers are increasingly focused on heart health and are, therefore, conscious of limiting their intake of trans fats and looking for low cholesterol products, including those which use natural plant sterols. Upfield’s products have natural ingredients (i.e., clean label and simple formulations with traceable ingredients) and are demonstrably healthier than their dairy equivalents, being cholesterol-free and trans-fat-free (for example, 100 grams of dairy butter has 3 grams of trans fat). Further, 95% of Upfield’s products beat the benchmark for saturated fats of dairy alternatives and Flora ProActiv is clinically proven to lower cholesterol by using plant sterols. Consumers are also more actively seeking out products which have incremental health benefits and fortified nutrition, such as added vitamins, calcium and healthy Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids. Upfield’s BlueBand contains vitamins and Omega 3 and 6, in addition to having the lowest saturated fat content (36%) in line with WHO recommendations. One portion of BlueBand contains 0.3g of Omega 3, which is equivalent to one portion of salmon, one glass of cow’s milk or three eggs. The above is not at the expense of taste, texture and affordability, which are still key purchasing criteria, as consumers look to buy healthier products with on-par performance at affordable price points. Due to the investment and innovation which Upfield has driven in its categories, Upfield’s Plant Butters and Spreads are, on average, approximately 40% cheaper and Upfield believes that they now have functional performance parity and almost taste parity with dairy equivalents. Specifically, eight out of ten consumers stated that Upfield’s Flora Salted Plant Butter tasted like dairy butter, while 92% said it baked the same, 83% said it cooked the same and 82% said it spread the same. In Poland, in 2023, Upfield was also honored that its new Rama Crema 15% product was recognized as the best new product in dairy creams and cream alternatives by leading trade magazine Handel. What is particularly inspiring is that Rama Crema 15% not only outperformed another plant-based cream but also two dairy options that made it to the final nominees. Upfield believes its Plant Creams have several health and environmental advantages over dairy creams, including a longer shelf life (reducing waste for customers and consumers), greater volume and stability in whipping, acid stable, heat stable and allergen free (where 100% plant-based).

Backed by a rich heritage and a global scale, we are highly differentiated in the plant-based sector. Our reinvigorated iconic power brands reflect over 150 years of product expertise and brand heritage and are trusted by consumers globally. Our scale, culture and capabilities, including extensive food technology and innovation expertise, our community of dedicated “Upfielders,” consisting of our management team and employees, and our 14 manufacturing facilities across five continents, provide a strong value proposition for our customers and consumers, and ensure we are well positioned to advance the future of food. Our products are marketed under a family of historic and iconic brands with strong recognition in their target markets. Our products are made with natural and sustainably sourced ingredients. Our carefully selected ingredients come from a diversified supply chain to minimize risk and environmental impact and maximize taste, functionality, health, affordability and sustainability for our consumers. Our operations are diversified across three regions, namely Europe, the Americas and AMEA. We hold leadership positions in the global butter and spreads, and plant cheese segments, with leadership positions in creams in Germany and the United Kingdom, our key creams markets.

Transforming the food system by increasing the consumption of plant-based foods in our diets is the key to address the impact of what we eat on climate, nature and health. As a global leader in plant-based food, offering our products in four large and growing categories and selling into over 100 countries worldwide, we are well positioned to advance the future of food and to meet the growing shift in consumer preferences to plant-based eating. To inspire more people to eat plant-based alternatives, we focus on delivering tasty, high performing, healthy, sustainable and affordable products. We believe that there should be no compromise for consumers when they change to plant-based products as compared to dairy alternatives. 91 ----- We benefit from a senior management team with significant experience in the consumer-packaged goods industry. A majority of our current senior management team has been with us since our acquisition by KKR in 2018, and has been critical in our successful transformation. Under their leadership, we have separated, transformed and reinvented our business as a global leader in plant-based food and strongly positioned our business to drive conversion to plant-based alternatives. We believe that our senior management team has also been instrumental in developing a strong and motivated organization with a purpose- and performance-driven culture, which is carried by a passionate and engaged community of “Upfielders.” We believe that our community of “Upfielders” are aligned with our purpose, and are highly motivated to make an impact, deliver sustainable, purposeful long-term growth and advance the transition to a plant-based food future. Our ability to advance the future of food is further strengthened by our portfolio of Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses products, sold through our reinvigorated and iconic brands, our global scale and manufacturing footprint, our food technology and innovation expertise which together provide a strong value proposition for our customers and consumers. We offer these plant-based products in our four core categories: Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses, which provide us access to a large and growing TAM (across both dairy and non-dairy) of approximately €151 billion as of 2022, which is 15 times larger than our TAM of approximately €11 billion in 2017 under our previous ownership (which was focused on plant-based spreads (margarines)). Our expansion into the Butter, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses categories, in addition to Spreads, resulted in an expansion of our TAM. While currently the penetration of plantbased products in the Butters, Creams and Cheeses categories is low, and estimated at less than 1%, there is a potential opportunity of approximately €23 billion (based on an incremental €7 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 5% plant-based penetration) or €38 billion (based on an incremental €22 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 16% plant-based penetration) (see also “Industry—Upfield’s TAM”). We believe that our global footprint and renovated and innovative product portfolio provide a significant growth opportunity in our TAM. Within our TAM (which covers both dairy and non-dairy products), given the growing consumer preference for plantbased diets in the backdrop of environmental, sustainability and health concerns, there is potential for increased rate of conversion to plant-based products, which we are well positioned to leverage, especially given our strong position globally and in the key markets in which we operate. For instance, according to NielsenIQ measurement data, within our Plant Butter and Spreads core category, which contributed 81% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, we are the largest producer globally in terms of market share and hold leading positions across some of the largest butter and spreads markets globally, including North America, Germany and the United Kingdom.

We believe that our power brands are deeply rooted and trusted by our consumers and customers across a number of our markets and have high brand awareness in their respective markets. These brands include, for example, Flora (launched in 1964), Country Crock (launched in 1954), Becel +ProActiv (Becel launched in 1962 and ProActiv launched in 2000), Rama (launched in 1924), BlueBand (launched in 1916) and Violife (acquired in 2020). In addition to our power brands, we also have a number of country or region specific brands with a strong local heritage and brand awareness, such as Lätta in Sweden, Stork in the United Kingdom and Tulipan in Spain. Following our acquisition by KKR, we have also reorganized and reinvigorated our brand portfolio since 2018. We refreshed our brands around our end-to-end brand platforms, so as to provide for better harmonization and efficiencies across our R&D and innovation pipeline, sales and marketing and supply chain activities. Our brand platforms are founded upon key prerequisites of taste and affordability, but each platform serves a distinct consumer need and is mapped against the key usage occasions and growth opportunities across our categories and markets. We also organize our brands across three different price tiers: “good,” (targeting price sensitive customers) “better” (targeting customers looking for additional product benefits at a more affordable price than a dairy alternative) and “best” (targeting customers seeking premium products with multiple features, such as lowering cholesterol). We assign our brands and products across these tiers which are each designed to meet distinct consumer needs and cater for certain price sensitivities, thereby catering to various social demographic needs.

We believe that we have an industry leading R&D expertise that enables us to produce new and innovative products using key ingredient know-how, technically sophisticated equipment and processes across our core categories and products. As an insights-driven organization we seek to continually enhance consumer experience with respect to taste, functionality, health and nutrition, sustainability and affordability by developing relevant product and packaging innovation. We continuously invest in food innovation and food technology expertise from our new state-of-the-art food science centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands (“Food Science Centre”), which we have developed with an investment capital of approximately €38 million. Our Food Science Centre focuses on plant-based food innovation and it aims to pioneer the development of plant-based foods, enabling technologies including oils and fats as well as proteins, and sustainable packaging solutions. Our team of more than 150 food scientists, food and packaging technologists and specialists focus on the development of plant-based foods and sustainable packaging solutions. We are also a leading filer of plant-based patents, and hold 656 patents and patent applications. In 2023, we applied for a further ten patents across our categories and core technologies. With our deep expertise in plant-based and natural ingredients and proprietary knowledge of plant-based food manufacturing, we have implemented a significant product portfolio overhaul since 2018, focused on taste, clean label and naturalness, where possible. For instance, we developed our first-generation Plant Butter product between 2018 and 2020, which we have since then further evolved, offering products we aim to achieve taste parity as compared to dairy butter. We have also developed new recipes and ingredients for our products, for example to provide consumers with palm oil-free options through our patented technology. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand, with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in early 2024. Our R&D and innovation roadmap is centered on continuous improvement and innovation within our core categories, to attract more and more consumers and broaden the appeal of our products. Key areas of focus include further improving our Plant Cheese product range, in particular in cold applications to further improve our Plant Cheese offering and applying some of our developing technology to further improve our Plant Butters and Plant Creams products. In addition, we continue to develop our packaging technology to create sustainable packaging and achieve our goal to reduce the environmental impact of our packaging through reduced plastic usage and increased recyclability of our packaging.

Our transformation journey since 2018 has taken place against a turbulent and volatile backdrop of events including a global pandemic, associated supply chain challenges, commodity inflation and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. However, during this period, by leveraging our growth levers, we have demonstrated a track record of stable financial performance, in particular delivered strong growth in organic net sales, gross profit and Normalized EBITDA. Between the year ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our reported net sales increased at a CAGR of 6.4%, our gross profit increased at a CAGR of 11.4% and our Normalized EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 12.1%. We have also demonstrated strong cash generation, and generated a normalized free cash flow and normalized free cash conversion ratio of €702 million and 81.4%, respectively, in each case, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe this compares favorably with our peers and is supported by, among other things: - our flexible cost base, which allows for a sustainable gross margin. We have clear, consistent and wellestablished supply chain, and hedging policies with respect to our major inputs and foreign exchange exposures, which has allowed us to maintain strong levels of profitability in periods of fluctuations and under high inflationary conditions; - our sustained profitability, with a Normalized EBITDA margin of 23.8%, 22.2%, 25.4% and 26.9%, in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, largely attributable to our flexible cost structure, our powerful brands, our revenue growth management capabilities and our track record of operational cost savings; - a favorable working capital position, as we benefit from a negative cash conversion cycle. This largely is a structural feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and finished product markets in which we operate and our operational efficiency with respect to our inventory management; and - our comprehensive manufacturing network with a globally scaled and digitally-enabled supply chain and significant spare capacity.

We are focused on delivering our best-ever products that are designed to have the same or superior taste, versatility and performance (cooking, baking, and spreading) as dairy products. We believe that there should be no compromise for consumers when they change to a plant-based butter or spread, liquid, plant-based cream or plant-based cheese, as compared to dairy alternatives. For example, our Plant Butter is specifically formulated with the aim to match the performance and taste of dairy butter. Based on more than 50 taste profiles, we created a series of plant butters which we strive to taste and perform just like dairy butter and that match the specific taste preferences of different consumer profiles in key markets. Also, our know-how and expertise of natural ingredients has enabled us to simplify our Plant Butter to contain just six or seven natural ingredients (including certain Plant Oils, water, plant protein and, in some cases, salt) and enable consumers to swap it directly for dairy butter in any recipe. Consumers are also increasingly focused on clean label and naturalness, and 99% of all our ingredients by volume are natural in origin. We continue to invest in R&D to deliver products using recipes made from natural ingredients or products that are free from artificial colors, flavors and preservatives, and without compromising on food safety, quality and performance. In addition, as part of our commitment to be 100% plant-based by the end of 2030, we are continuously reviewing our use of dairy ingredients where there is no compromise in taste or performance. Aside from taste and performance, we focus on the nutritional benefits of our products, as well as their positive contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and a key reason why people choose our products. In 2022, our team of nutritionists and product developers created the Upfield nutritional benchmarking program, based on what science tells us is required for each different product proposition and which introduced saturated fat and trans-fat targets for plant creams and plant cheeses. This helps us ensure that we meet nutritional targets in our products and are aligned with international dietary guidelines and regulations. Our plant-based products contain zero trans-fats and lower saturated fats compared to dairy alternatives. So, whether consumers are looking for a product to bake a cake, help lower their cholesterol or containing the nutrients to support a growing family, our products strive to provide a “no compromise” choice, that is better for consumers and better for the planet. _Deploying our power brands: leveraging our iconic power brands, recognized, trusted and loved over the world with clear propositions_ Our business traces its origin and heritage back over 150 years and, as a result, many of our reinvigorated iconic power brands, including BlueBand and Rama, have a brand heritage spanning over 100 years. Our power brands, including as an example, Flora, Country Crock, Becel +ProActiv, Rama, BlueBand and Violife, are trusted in their key markets globally and are at the heart of our future growth strategy and success. Our power brands are well-known and have a high brand awareness amongst consumers in our markets. They represent the platform from which we have successfully launched our product innovations and portfolio renovation. Through our power brands we engage with both loyal and new consumers, offering people a positive choice, both as a plant-based alternative to dairy and also for less competitive brands and private label. Based on independent brand research, many of our power brands are among the best-performing FMCG/packaged grocery brands across our key markets in terms of brand awareness. We believe that the high score of our power brands indicate that consumers are more likely to choose our brands over others, which is a strong indicator of increasing brand influence and share. To further support our power brands, we complemented the ongoing innovation across our portfolio with an increase in strategic advertising and promotion investment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our advertising and promotion expenses amounted to €173 million (equalling 5.3% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 and an increase of 22.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022). For example, in 2023, we launched our “Skip the Cow” campaign aimed at informing and driving consumers towards more plant-based products. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign pushed the uptake of Flora Plant and has proved to be a valuable resource in boosting consumer awareness of our Plant Butter offering and also contributed to a strong positive consumer net sentiment of 86% towards our overall Flora brand. Furthermore, following the “Skip the Cow” campaign, Flora Plant Butter experienced growth in household penetration and share of segment in the United Kingdom. Following the success of the “Skip the Cow” campaign in the United Kingdom, we launched similar campaigns across European markets, such as Germany and Austria, and intend to also roll it out to other key markets such as the Netherlands, Poland or Spain, and also across other brands. To further leverage the 95 ----- strength of our brands, we have from time to time considered, and continue to consider and evaluate, modifications to our corporate branding and identity to more closely align with our key brands. _Executing in multiple channels: reaching as many people as possible through our channels: retail and foodservice_ We also differentiate ourselves through our retail and professional foodservice channels, which enable us to reach consumers directly through both industry channels. We sell our products to retail outlets, including to many of the world’s largest retailers, as well as to wholesalers. We also enhanced our e-commerce capabilities by developing relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco, Amazon and Carrefour online, which have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe represent a significant growth opportunity in the regions in which we operate, especially in Europe and the Americas. In addition, in emerging markets in which we operate across our regions, we have established a strong market channel based on deep relationships with well-known and reputable distributors. Through our foodservice channel, we also supply the professional channel, including restaurants, hotels and industrial kitchens. This multi-channel approach gives us access to a broad and diverse customer base, which enhances our position as a leader in many of our core categories. Because of our strong relationships with leading global and regional retailers, we operate as the supplier of choice and/or “category captain” for certain strategic retailers, providing in-depth knowledge and consumer insight for particular product categories to our retailer customers. Moreover, we believe there is considerable potential to introduce and expand our core product categories in the foodservice channel given our current portfolio’s appeal across high-end clients who lead and influence the menu adoption cycle to large quick-service restaurants, bakery chains and other national accounts where mass adoption occurs. Our growth strategy in foodservice is focused on selling value-added branded products with high-demand applications to commercial customers and driving customer acquisition through our chef-led sales approach (see also “—Sales and _Marketing”). Driving and leveraging our scale: leveraging our digitally enabled end-to-end platform and scale_ Through our end-to-end globally scaled and digitally-enabled platform we produce and sell our products to retail and foodservice partners in over 100 countries globally. Our global footprint, scale and expertise along the value chain allow us to leverage efficiencies through which we can derive significant advantages compared to other plant-based competitors and dairy players. Since 2018, we have demonstrated a track record in driving efficiencies for example by establishing product portfolio efficiencies (through the retirement of SKUs that are less profitable or of low productivity and the simplification of our recipes), procurement efficiencies (by sourcing most of our ingredients and packaging materials from global suppliers who can deliver locally), supply chain efficiencies (through our established local retail and distribution network) and by maintaining a continued focus on operational efficiencies in line with our value creation program. Establishing such efficiencies allows us to offer affordable products.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.15,Strategies,18.15.2,Continuously delivering our Purpose,"Our purpose is “to make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and for our planet” and it shapes how we approach the sourcing of our ingredients, the development of our recipes, our relationships with retailers and how we communicate with consumers. We intend to continue fulfilling our purpose with our commitment and initiatives across our four pillars: (i) plant-based, (ii) healthier lives, (iii) happier people and (iv) better planet, which are at the heart of our business with tangible programs and milestones. _Plant-Based_ Actively helping the food transition and building a better, plant-based future is at the heart of what we do. Our plant-based commitment pillar seeks to help inspire and encourage consumers to switch from dairy to plant-based options. As we continue to improve our product portfolio, we aim to reach one billion consumers with our products by 2030. We believe we can achieve that goal by offering consumers a range of products that meet their needs, which also includes making sure our products taste great, perform well, and are made with simple, natural ingredients. We believe we are in a strong position to support the transition to a plant-based diet by offering tasty, affordable, nutritious and more sustainable products. From our Food Science Centre, we continuously invest in high performance product formulations and reformulations to keep up with consumer needs and trends. For example, in 2023, we launched the Violife cream cheese block in the United States which has been developed specifically to compete with leading dairy cream cheeses on the market, following a completely new formulation and format. To spread awareness around our plant-based products, we frequently launch retail consumer advertising campaigns with slogans aimed at informing and driving consumers and professionals towards more plant-based products. 96 ----- Other efforts to boost our brands’ and products’ visibility include, for example, sponsorship of sporting events and partnerships with celebrities and influencers. In addition, we are also working to support the industry moving forward in terms of plant-based innovation, which includes establishing standard parameters for plant-based products. For example, we are currently leading the development of a new ISO standard that we expect will specify technical definitions of, and criteria for, plant-based foods. We believe that this new ISO standard will help align the global food industry around a single terminology approach. _Healthier Lives_ The second pillar focuses on the nutritional benefits of our products as well as their positive contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and we believe is a key reason why people choose our products. We aim for our products to outperform their dairy counterparts with respect to levels of saturated and trans-fats. We take a sciencebased approach to establishing criteria and targets for each product type we sell, considering who uses them, how frequently and in which applications. These targets are based on recognized external international standards and official dietary recommendations, including those from the World Health Organization. Moreover, we have set additional targets that ensure we can deliver the desired nutritional composition. These include considerations on how we can limit nutrients of concern and provide essential nutrients that target some of the greatest public health areas of concern, such as heart health and children’s growth and development. Our brands BlueBand and Becel +ProActiv are our global brands focused on positively impacting lives across the world by offering healthy, affordable and nutritious options. In 2023, approximately 30% of our net sales came from products providing health and nutrition benefits and that can be labelled as such, in compliance with regulation. Additionally, we believe the future of food lies in quality, responsibly made, plant-based foods. To realize this future and provide consumers with healthier options, we intend to continue implementing rigorous quality and safety standards at both our and third-party facilities, including for product design, formulation, raw material sourcing, packing, manufacturing, storage, transport, display, marketing, communication, sales and product disposal. Moreover, we intend to continue ensuring that our products are accessible to as many people as possible, which includes ensuring our products come in at affordable price points. In this regard we intend to maintain a portfolio of products designed for budgetary brackets across the market spectrum and which are more affordable than dairy alternatives, without compromising on quality. _Happier People_ We believe that people are happier when they are engaged and we actively promote a culture of active support. We are committed to our community of dedicated “Upfielders.” Our approach to employee engagement is driven by three core values: performance, care and passion. To nurture an engaged workforce, we complete an annual survey to gauge employee sentiment and opportunities for progress. In addition, diverse businesses are likely to be more successful and we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive working environment. Across our supply chains, we are connected to thousands of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs who grow our ingredients and chefs who create and prepare millions of meals every day. In support of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs, we maintain several partnerships, enabling and encouraging them to improve agricultural practices and access to markets. In addition, we seek to reach as many chefs and food service professionals as possible to encourage the adoption of our products into their cooking, thereby engaging chefs in the plant-based revolution. We do this by, for example, hosting cooking workshops for chefs or participating in trade fairs where we can reach out and educate professionals on the advantages of plant-based cooking. _Better Planet_ With an environmental footprint significantly smaller than that of dairy products, our products can help consumers reduce their impact, and we ensure our operations do so as well. We are committed to responsibly sourcing ingredients, developing sustainable packaging and addressing our carbon emissions to enhance sustainability. Our better planet commitments include our environmental targets to address our material environmental impacts on the climate, on packaging and on responsible sourcing. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we committed to Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”) and have worked on redefining our targets in line with the newly published Forest, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) guidance to align with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. In this respect, we are making multiple efforts towards reducing our emissions and reducing environmental impact through waste and water management at our manufacturing facilities. In addition, we are committed to providing packaging that protects products and the planet. We delivered a milestone packaging achievement with the 97 ----- launch of the world’s first paper-based tub for plant-based butters and spreads, our Flora Plant paper tub at the end of 2023, starting our journey towards our target of reducing plastic across our portfolio by 80% by 2030 (compared to a 2020 baseline). In addition, we are committed to responsible and sustainable sourcing of our ingredients (including our Plant Oils) and packaging materials (including paper and pulp) and our “Responsible Sourcing Policy” and “Business Partner Code of Conduct” applies to all our suppliers. Where key ingredients are identified as potentially high risk, we maintain strong individual policies designed to address the potential risks inherent in these supply chains, particularly focussing on deforestation and exploitation.

Our clear mission and purpose forms the cornerstone of our strategy to deliver long term sustainable, profitable and purposeful growth by bringing tasty plant-based foods to people all over the world, and achieve our purpose “to make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and for our planet.” 94 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.16,History,18.16.1,,"Upfield was established in 2018, as a purpose-driven company with a clear vision: “To make people healthier and happier with nutritious and delicious, natural, plant-based food that is good for you and good for our planet.” While Upfield is a young company, our business traces its origin and heritage back over 150 years, when the Jurgens family bought the patent for Plant Spreads. Many of our iconic power brands have brand heritage spanning over 100 years and under its prior ownership, our business evolved into one of the earliest large-scale producers of dairy alternatives globally, focused on plant-based spreads. Following the acquisition of Upfield by KKR in 2018, we began a journey to separate, transform and reinvent the business, building on our existing strong foundations: a global platform with iconic power brands and world-class knowledge. Building on these foundations and as a result of the significant industrial, digital and cultural transformation undertaken since 2018, Upfield has established itself as a global leader in plant-based food, operating in multiple categories with a global end-to-end supply chain. At the outset, we formulated and adopted our Upfield manifesto, with a clear, purpose-driven vision and a datadriven mission to guide us as an independent company. During the last five years, we have invested over €1.6 billion to reinvent our business: by simplifying, renovating and innovating our existing product portfolio, expanding into new product categories and investing in our end-to-end supply chain while further investing and developing our IT system. In the initial separation and stabilization phase, we exited more than 600 transitional service agreements that were still in place from Upfield’s previous owner, built our fully digital, cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and completed the complex separation from Unilever to become a fully independent business by June 2020. Prior to KKR’s ownership, Upfield’s business was largely focused on margarine. As a first step, we began innovating our margarine and spreads business by working towards clean label products and developing palm oil-free recipes. Gradually we shifted and expanded our category focus by developing and launching our Plant Butter offering, specifically formulated to aim to replicate the performance and taste of dairy butter. By 2019, we reprioritized our Creams and Liquids core categories and achieved volume growth in these categories. In January 2020, we expanded into the Cheese category following the acquisition of Arivia, a leading producer of plant-based cheese through Violife. Since 2018, we have undertaken a significant innovation and renovation program across our product portfolio, introducing natural, plant-based ingredients and harmonizing and rationalizing the number of SKUs and recipes to focus on fewer but better products. For example, we have upgraded and renovated a significant proportion of our product portfolio since 2018, with approximately 85% of our European spreads sales in 2022 being from products renovated or innovated since 2020, to retire SKUs which were less profitable or of low productivity, such that we operate with approximately 1,200 active SKUs as of the third quarter of 2023 (down from 2,600 SKUs in 2018), excluding Plant Cheeses. Furthermore, we restructured our portfolio of distinct recipes from over 340 distinct recipes for Plant Butter and Spreads in Europe in 2018 to focus on 18 chassis. We harmonized and aligned our brand portfolio into key end-to-end brand platforms which allows continued harmonization and efficiencies across our R&D and innovation pipeline and supply chain. Our innovation and food technology roadmap is led out of our Food Science Centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands, which opened its doors in 2022 following an investment of approximately €38 million. Our Food Science Centre leads our research and reformulation programs to continue simplifying our recipes, with an aim to deliver our bestever products from natural, plant-based ingredients which are better for consumers and better for the planet. As a result of the above factors, our TAM across our four core categories, i.e., Butters and Spreads, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses, has increased 15 times to approximately €151 billion in 2022 as compared to approximately €11 billion in 2017. Our expansion into the Butter, Creams, Liquids and Cheeses categories, in addition to Spreads, resulted in an expansion of our TAM. While currently the penetration of plant-based products in the Butters, Creams and Cheeses 98 ----- categories is low, and estimated at less than 1%, there is a potential opportunity of approximately €23 billion (based on an incremental €7 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 5% plant-based penetration) or €38 billion (based on an incremental €22 billion opportunity in the above categories when assuming a 16% plant-based penetration) (see also “Industry—Upfield’s TAM”). We optimized our supply chain footprint, closing five of our own manufacturing facilities including in Nassakaude Rotterdam (the Netherlands), Rexdale (Canada) and Purfleet (the United Kingdom). At the same time, we reinvested and modernized our footprint of 14 owned manufacturing facilities to support our growth objectives across our core categories. In addition, we introduced a value creation program, which focusses on making our business more efficient from an operational perspective and in particular through supply chain areas including, amongst others, procurement, manufacturing and portfolio simplification. Since the implementation of this program in 2018, we have realized approximately €415 million of costs savings in aggregate, with €90 million of cost savings achieved in 2023 alone. Our journey since 2018 has taken place against a turbulent and volatile backdrop of events including a global pandemic, associated supply chain challenges, commodity inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. Our transformation since 2018 was enabled by a purpose and performance-driven culture, which is carried by a passionate and engaged community of approximately 4,800 “Upfielders”, consisting of our management team and employees. Our community of “Upfielders” are aligned with our purpose, and are highly motivated to make an impact, deliver sustainable, purposeful long-term growth and advance the transition to a plant-based food future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.17,Products,18.17.1,Brands,"Our brands are organized across end-to-end brand platforms which are founded upon key prerequisites of taste and affordability, but each serves a distinct consumer need and is mapped against the key usage occasions and growth opportunities across our categories and markets. Organizing our brands in this way also allows for continued and ongoing harmonization and efficiencies across our R&D and innovation pipeline, sales and marketing and supply chain activities with respect to our brands and products. Our brand platforms are led by our power brands, our most iconic brands, which have a long history and heritage. We believe that our power brands are deeply rooted and trusted by our consumers and customers across a number of our markets and have high brand awareness in their respective markets. These brands include, for example, Flora (launched in 1964 with a strong presence in the United Kingdom and increasingly other European markets), Country Crock (launched in 1954 and present today in the United States), Becel +ProActiv (Becel launched in 1962 and ProActiv launched in 2000 with a strong presence in European markets and Canada), Rama (launched in 1924 with a strong presence in Germany), BlueBand (launched in 1916 and present today in the Netherlands, Indonesia and other markets within AMEA) and Violife (which is a leading plant-based cheese brand globally, with an especially strong presence in the United States and the United Kingdom, which are the leading plant-based cheese markets), acquired in 2020. Our power brands accounted for the majority of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to our power brands, we have a number of country or region specific brands with a strong local heritage and brand awareness. Such local brands include for example, Lätta, a leading plant-based spreads brand in Sweden, Tulipan, a popular brand of over 70 years in Spain, under which we offer Plant Butter and Spreads without any palm oil, and Stork, which was launched more than 100 years ago and which has become a leading baking brand in the United Kingdom. Our brands and products are positioned across the price ladder in their markets with affordability being a key focus. We organize our brands across three tiers: “good,” “better” and “best.” Each tier is strategically designed to meet distinct consumer needs and certain price sensitivities, thereby catering to a wider audience. We believe that the “good,” “better” and “best” pricing strategy simplifies consumer decision-making and strategically position each tier to appeal to different segments. Brands that sit in the “good” tier target price-sensitive consumers in their respective markets with a plant-based spread product and includes brands such as Imperial (the United States, Mexico), Rama (Germany), Stork 99 ----- (the United Kingdom), Delma (Poland and Hungary) and Lätta (Sweden). The “better” tier offers a broader product offering and are therefore positioned at a slightly higher price point, attracting consumers who are looking for additional product benefits but still affordable compared to the dairy alternative. Brands such as Country Crock (the United States), Flora (the United Kingdom), Becel (Netherlands, Canada) and BlueBand (Indonesia, Netherlands) fall within the “better” pricing tier. The “best” tier contains brands which offer a premium product for consumers, with multiple features and in some cases health benefits, such as Becel +ProActiv which contains plant sterols which are clinically proven to lower cholesterol. Brands such as Becel +ProActiv, Violife as well as some plant butter offerings in certain markets fall within the “best” pricing tier. On average, our Plant Butter and Spreads cost 40% less compared to dairy alternatives.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Our Plant Butter and Spreads are made from Plant Oils, water, salt and protein and are suitable for key usage occasions including baking, cooking and spreading. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our Plant Butter and Spreads represented 81% of our net sales. Our Plant Butter is specifically formulated with the aim to match the performance and taste of dairy butter. It contains six to seven natural ingredients including Plant Oils, plant-based proteins, natural flavourings, water and, in some cases, salt. Our Plant Butter comes in a wrapper like dairy butter, which allows it to more effectively target the baking and cooking occasion. Our Plant Spreads have been largely reformulated since 2018, introducing natural, plant-based ingredients and harmonizing and rationalizing the number of SKUs and recipes to focus on fewer but better products. Our Plant Spreads contain fat levels between approximately 20% to 75% depending on format and usage occasion. Whereas our Plant Butter is specifically designed with the aim of replicating dairy butter in terms of both taste and functionality for baking, cooking and spreading applications, our variety of plant spreads are more focused on specific usage occasions. For example, depending on fat levels, our Plant Spreads may be most suitable for baking, cooking or spreading. Our Plant Butter and Spreads cover a wide range of categories based on storage temperature, including (i) chilled products, (ii) ambient products, which are solid at room temperature and (iii) tropical ambient products (for Plant Spreads), which remain solid at the higher temperatures typically experienced in tropical climates. Our Plant Butter and Spreads are also available in multiple formats suitable for a variety of occasions, including wrappers and tubs for spreading, cooking and baking purposes, sachets for spreading and topping, as well as large format tubs and portion packs for the foodservice industry. Our Plant Butter and Spreads have several health and environmental advantages over dairy butter. One of their benefits includes the higher Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid concentrations and zero trans-fat and lower saturated fat content per serving. Additionally, the production of plant butter and spreads requires fewer resources and have a significantly lower overall carbon footprint than dairy butter and other comparable dairy products.

As is typical in the food industry, we do not have long-term contractual commitments with our key customers. Instead, we enter into bespoke joint business plans with customers, which usually encompass pricing, trade terms, support for new innovation, assortment, distribution and shelf space. In some markets, the agreements also include promotional activity for the year, although in most markets it is still possible to change promotional activity and pricing during the year. We have also developed relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco, Amazon and Carrefour online, which have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe represent a significant growth opportunity in the regions in which we operate, especially in Europe and the Americas. Our foodservice business operates in 76 countries across Europe, the Americas and AMEA. Approximately 44% of our foodservice net sales come from the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Germany, Sweden and Mexico.

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.22,Competition,18.22.1,,"We are a global leader in plant-based food. While there are other local and regional producers of plant-based products, we are strongly positioned in the market of plant butter and spreads, plant creams and plant cheeses. See “Industry.” Our plant-based products face competition from alternative products such as dairy butter, cooking oils, traditional dairy creams and animal-based cheeses and sweet spreads amongst others. The competitive dynamics in our industry are, in particular, driven by changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. These include dietary, health and environmental concerns and trends, such as increasing awareness of different nutritional aspects of foods and the health effects and sourcing practices relating to specific ingredients, an increasing preference for dairy-free, vegan and organic food ingredients, trends towards eating and baking outside of home and concerns regarding public health consequences associated with obesity and increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of production (in particular those related to palm oil, which is a key ingredient in many products across our portfolio). See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Changes in Food Trends and Consumer Preferences” and_ “Industry—Key Trends” for a description of changes in food trends and consumer preferences affecting our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.23,Sales and Marketing,18.23.1,,"We aim to solidify and enhance our market-leading brand awareness and increase penetration of plant-based food in our core categories by leveraging our brand heritage and our products’ ability to meet key consumer purchasing criteria with respect to taste, functionality, health and nutrition, sustainability and affordability. By building and supporting our brands, we believe we can educate and inspire consumers to move to plant-based foods. Over the years, we have introduced millions of consumers to our plant-based products. For example, in 2023, we reached an additional 55 million consumers based on household penetration data by country and product sales (bringing us to approximately 261 million consumers reached as of December 31, 2023), which is a significant contribution to our goal of “inspiring the shift” and reaching one billion people with our plant-based products by 2030. Our sales teams are organized by region and local market, with overall strategic guidance and direction provided at a global level in line with our overall corporate strategy. Regional sales teams are responsible for regional sales and promotional strategy, and alongside local teams plan the end-to-end sales process and activities across sales planning, sales execution and sales promotion activities. Local teams manage day-to-day operations and execution in both retail and foodservice channels and manage customer relationships and, where relevant, distributor relationships. Our marketing function is led by dedicated marketing teams in each region and lead markets, with overall strategic guidance and communications support provided at a central level in line with our overall corporate strategy. The regional marketing leads are responsible for developing the overall marketing and strategy and work closely with our markets units, sales, supply chain and R&D teams to support sales and operational planning, and execute our overall marketing strategy in line with our overall objectives. This includes engaging with customers on promotional displays and merchandising, as well as planning key marketing and promotional campaigns and providing key consumer insights and intelligence across the business. This is supported by our interactive data visualization Power BI platform and key consumer and market insight data from brand experts engaged by us, amongst other initiatives. Through targeted campaigns and consumer engagement, we work to increase public knowledge of how our products can contribute to healthier, more sustainable diets. This year, we have continued to develop new and innovative marketing campaigns like “Skip the Cow” and the #MakeItPlant campaign to drive consumers, chefs and foodservice providers to choose more plant-based options. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign, initially under the Flora brand, was meant to inspire the shift to plant-based products and promote the benefits of our Plant Butter which has approximately 75% less climate impact in terms of CO₂ emissions than dairy butter. Since the launch of the campaign at the beginning of 2023, sales volumes of Flora Plant Butter have increased by more than 59% in the United Kingdom for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Furthermore, Flora Plant Butter experienced growth in household penetration and share of segment in the United Kingdom. Our “Skip the Cow” campaign has pushed the uptake of Flora Plant and has proved to be a valuable resource in boosting consumer awareness and positive net sentiment (86%) towards our Flora brand. Following the success of the “Skip the Cow” campaign in the United Kingdom, 103 ----- we launched similar campaigns across European markets, such as Germany and Austria, and have started to also roll it out to other key markets such as the Netherlands, Poland or Spain, and also across other brands.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,167,R&D,167.2,Procurement,167.2.1,,"Our procurement function sits within our global supply chain function and is led by our Chief Procurement Officer. We operate a predominantly centralized procurement function designed to leverage our purchasing expertise and maximize scale efficiencies across the regions where we operate. Our procurement function has a deep understanding of commodity cycles and risk management, and many years of experience in the oils market. Sourcing strategy, commodities risk management, hedging and procurement value creation are designed and managed by the central procurement team, which is also responsible for the sourcing of Plant Oils. Regional procurement teams are responsible for sourcing of other inputs and materials and supplier management. We source most of our food ingredients and packaging materials from global suppliers who can deliver locally, and our supply chain is aligned with our geographic footprint, enabling us to optimize our supply arrangements and minimize logistics costs. We have developed strong, long-standing relationships with our major suppliers of key raw materials, many of which have been in place for over a decade. The principal ingredient in our Plant Butter and Spreads, Plant Creams, Liquids and Plant Cheeses are refined Plant Oils (such as rapeseed oil (approximately 33% of our total Plant Oils volume and of which the majority is sourced from Europe), soybean oil (approximately 17% of our total Plant Oils volume and of which the majority is sourced from North America), sunflower oil (approximately 5% of our total Plant Oils volume and which we entirely source from Europe), palm oil, palm kernel oil, derivatives and fractions (approximately 36% of our total Plant Oils volume and of which the majority is sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia) and coconut oil (approximately 6% of our total Plant Oils volume and of which the majority is sourced from the Philippines)), in each case, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additional primary materials used in our production process include other ingredients and packaging materials. Our risk management mechanisms include the use of physical stocks. futures, forward contracts, derivatives and other financial hedging transactions to provide certainty and insulate the business from short term price volatility across a majority of its input commodities, with initiatives underway to expand the scope of such measures to cover packaging material costs as well. In addition, we are committed to responsible and sustainable sourcing of all our ingredients and our Responsible Sourcing Policy, Human Rights Policy and Business Partner Code of Conduct applies to all our suppliers. Our target is to be 100% deforestation free and conversion free by 2025. Since October 2019, all of the palm oil directly purchased by us is certified (segregated and mass balance), which means that our supply chain has been assessed against strict criteria set-out by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). In 2023, we achieved a score of 8.5 (out of 10) on the RSPO’s Shared Responsibility Scorecard, placing us in the top 4% of companies demonstrating sustainable leadership in palm oil sourcing. Beyond sourcing certified (segregated and mass balance) palm oil, we partner with independent experts like Earthworm and use satellite technology to monitor our supply chains. This satellite technology enables us to monitor the sources of the palm oil we purchase, which in turn allows us to address deforestation risks with our supply chain partners. We continue to innovate and create new recipes both with sustainable palm and alternatives to palm oil, namely through our patented palm oil-free technology. We have also taken significant steps in increasing the transparency of our coconut oil supply chain. After joining the Sustainable Coconut Charter in January 2022, we ran a supplier assessment and policy 105 ----- review. By the end of 2022, 100% of our coconut oil suppliers agreed with our policy and started to share their countrylevel traceability with us, which gives us the visibility to ensure sustainability throughout our supply chains. Furthermore, we continue to maintain our policy commitments for certified paper sourcing (Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSC”)/Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification “PEFC”) and ensuring soybean oil is sourced in compliance with the Amazon Soy Moratorium Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2023, materials, which include Plant Oils, other ingredients, flavors, finished goods from third-party manufacturers and packaging materials, represented 67% of our total cost of sales.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,167,R&D,167.7,"Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”)",167.7.1,Plant-Based,"The first pillar of our ESG strategy, plant-based, is dedicated to inspiring more people to eat plant-based food. Our role is to ensure that, through our brands, we offer a range of options that meet consumer needs. This includes seeking to ensure that our products taste great, perform well, are better for consumers and are made with simple and natural ingredients. We aim to reach one billion people with our products by 2030. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that we reached approximately 261 million consumers, based on household penetration data by country and product sales, with our plant-based products, an increase of 55 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, we want to deliver a 100% plant-based product portfolio by 2030. Whilst we are already over 99% dairy-free, dairy ingredients have the highest carbon impact of the ingredients in our portfolio and make a disproportionate contribution to our total carbon footprint. As such, we have continued to invest in research and reformulation programs that have cut dairy ingredients by 1.5 kiloton since 2022. Another one of our commitments is to have an all-natural ingredients product portfolio by 2030. We want to create recipes with natural ingredients, with simple, clean labels. Currently, 99% of our ingredients are natural and during 2023, we have continued our investments in R&D to simplify our recipes and aim to deliver the best-ever products created by us, with natural ingredients. In addition, in recent periods, a key focus area has been to transition artificial colors and artificial flavors to natural ones. In addition to advancing our own efforts, we are working to support the industry forward in terms of plant-based innovation, which includes establishing standard parameters for what plant-based means. We are currently leading the 107 ----- development of a new ISO standard that will specify technical definitions of, and criteria for, plant-based foods. We believe that this new ISO standard will help align the global food industry around a single terminology approach.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,167,R&D,167.7,"Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”)",167.7.2,Healthier Lives,"The second pillar of our ESG strategy focuses on the nutritional benefits of our products as well as their positive contribution to health. Health is a high priority for consumers and a key reason why people choose our products. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 30% of our net sales came from products that provide health and nutrition benefits and can be labelled as such in compliance with regulations. This includes products with lower saturated fat and no trans-fat per serving and plant sterols for heart health, the addition of vitamins, calcium, Omega 3 and 6 and lower calorie options, which support functional health. We take a science-based approach to establishing criteria and targets for each product type we sell, considering who uses them, how frequently and in which applications. In 2023, we continued to expand our nutritional benchmarking program, following its launch in 2022, based on what science tells us is required for each different product proposition and which introduced saturated fat and trans-fat targets for plant creams and plant cheeses. As a result, over 91% of our sold volume met or exceeded our benchmarks for the year ended December 31, 2023. These targets are based on recognized external international standards and official dietary recommendations, including those from the World Health Organization. We have set additional targets that ensure we can deliver the desired nutritional composition. These include considerations for how we can limit nutrients of concern and provide essential nutrients that target some of the critical public health areas of concern, including heart health and children’s growth and development. We believe the future of food lies in quality, responsibly made, plant-based foods. To realize that future, we need to ensure our products are accessible to as many people as possible, which includes ensuring our products come in at affordable price points. Globally, our Plant Butter and Spreads remain significantly more affordable than their dairy counterparts. This is true compared to private label dairy butter and even more so compared to branded dairy butter. In the United States, our Imperial brand offers a strong value-for-money proposition for value-seeking consumers. One of our commitments is to maintain such affordability, especially for consumers in lower socio-economic groups. Additionally, we seek to positively impact people’s lives, including by educating children on nutrition and by enabling heart health and improving functional health. For example, under our brand BlueBand we implemented a program “Sarapan Berisi BlueBand” (“Nutritious Breakfast with BlueBand”) for children across Indonesia in 2023. The goal of this program was to inspire families to prioritize healthy breakfasts by demonstrating the connection between good nutrition, particularly Omega 3 and 6 intake, enhanced school performance and greater success throughout life. Our brand Becel +ProActiv has always championed heart health and is clinically proven to lower blood cholesterol. During 2023, we launched several marketing campaigns to heighten brand awareness and encourage consumers to commence actions to ensure heart health later on. In Brazil, our Não Deixe Para Depois (“Don’t Leave It for Later”) campaign, which featured an engaging video about Becel +ProActiv, reached approximately 37 million people in 2023. Also, we expanded our market penetration in 2023, launching Becel +ProActiv in Saudi Arabia and therewith enabling more people to access heart-healthier choices.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

In addition to our employees, we are committed to supporting our wider community of stakeholders, including our suppliers and farmers. To nurture an engaged workforce, we complete an annual survey to gauge employee sentiment and opportunities for progress. See also “—Employees.” In 2021, we set the target of a 50/50 gender split by 2030, with a focus on managers and above. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we achieved approximately 43% women representation at management level and 38% across the entire workforce. In addition, in 2022, we began developing the “Women in Finance and IT” program to level gender representation in finance and IT, which aims to advance female finance and IT professionals through bespoke training, peer-to-peer support, expert guidance and mindfulness tools. While the program was still in its first year, for the year ended December 31, 2023, female representation reached 45% (up from 44% in 2022) in our finance functions and 33% (up from 28% in 2022) in IT functions. In addition, we want to support our communities through employee volunteering. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we reached 5,646 hours of employee volunteering, an increase of 18% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We are committed to reach 15,000 hours of employee volunteering annually. 108 ----- Across our supply chains, we are connected to thousands of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs who grow our ingredients and chefs who create and prepare millions of meals every day. In support of farmers and plant-based entrepreneurs, we maintain several partnerships, enabling and encouraging them to improve agricultural practices and access to markets. For example, to reduce emissions and support sustainable farming practices, we have teamed up with Regrow Ag, an agricultural technology company. By using their technology, we can analyse the environmental impacts of our North American soy, canola and sunflower supply chains. This allows us to develop an increasingly accurate and meaningful emissions reduction strategy and identify opportunities to implement regenerative agriculture practices in our supply chains, directing investments to farmers to support emissions reductions and climate resilience. This, in turn, will drive progress towards our wider Science Based Target initiative (“SBTi”) commitment while increasing our ability to source sustainable, responsible, plant-based ingredients (see also “—Better Planet”). In addition, we seek to reach as many chefs and food service professionals as possible to encourage the adoption of our products into their cooking, thereby engaging chefs in the plant-based revolution. For example, in May 2023, our MENA (Middle East and North Africa) team hosted a cooking workshop in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia whereby a number of local chefs came together to learn about our brands and how they can be incorporated into recipes. The workshop also served as a platform to launch new products to the Saudi Arabian market, including Violife cheeses and Rama cream.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,167,R&D,167.7,"Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”)",167.7.4,Better Planet,"The goal guiding our fourth ESG pillar is “to pioneer food,” that is, we want to be on the forefront of creating food that is better for the planet by showcasing the benefit of plant-based products while reducing our carbon footprint. Our better planet commitments include our environmental targets to address our material environmental impacts on the climate, on packaging and on responsible sourcing. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we committed to SBTi and have worked on redefining our targets in line with the newly published Forest, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) guidance to align with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We also made progress on the reduction of our Scope 1 emissions (i.e., direct emissions owned or controlled by a company) and Scope 2 emissions (i.e., indirect emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the carbon impact of our manufacturing facilities, representing the majority of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, was reduced by 16.7%, in absolute emissions, through the implementation of our decarbonization plan focused on improving energy efficiency and shifting to lower-carbon and renewable energy sources. One example of our decarbonization plan is the installation of a modern steam boiler room in our Polish (Katowice) manufacturing facility in 2023, helping us to move away from coal-fired steam as a fuel source in our manufacturing process. By upgrading the Polish (Katowice) manufacturing facility plant boiler, we expect to reduce our emissions by approximately 6,800 tonnes annually. Our Scope 3 emissions (i.e., emissions not covered by Scope 1 and 2 emissions, created by a company’s value chain) plan focuses on the biggest drivers of our footprint, namely ingredients, packaging and logistics. We have made progress across Scope 3 emissions in our supply chain, driven by reformulation, dairy elimination, recycled packaging increases and changes in the mix of our portfolio, delivering a 13% reduction in absolute emissions in the year. For the year ended December 31, 2023, over 62% of our carbon footprint came from ingredients. Dairy, for example, which accounts for just less than 1% of our ingredients, represented over 5% of our carbon impact, making removing it from our portfolio an important step towards reducing our emissions. Since 2020, we have reduced dairy-related carbon emissions, including methane, by over 43% as we have continued to develop more plant-based recipes. Beside emissions, we are reducing environmental impact through waste and water management at our manufacturing facilities. For example, our manufacturing facility in Drama, Greece, is reducing environmental impact through a new wastewater treatment plant that will ensure manufacturing facility outflow is safe and clean. The facility has been designed for high operational efficiency, reducing the chemicals and energy needed to treat wastewater. It will also reduce the volume of sludge created as a by-product by up to 95% while ensuring any effluent continues to meet relevant environmental standards. In addition, we are targeting a 100% zero waste to landfill by 2030. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 85%, or 11, of our manufacturing facilities achieved zero waste to landfill, with an absolute reduction of 11.9% and over 150% increase in reused waste versus 2022. Moreover, we are committed to providing packaging that protects our products and the planet. Wherever we incorporate paper-based materials into packaging, we look to do so responsibly in line with our responsible sourcing of paper and pulp policy. We maintain high levels of recyclability for our packaging format and have continued to increase our recycled content. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 93% of our packaging is recyclable, reusable or compostable. Our packaging goals are intended to reduce environmental impact without compromising quality and performance. In 2023, we successfully launched our paper tub packaging technology in Austria under our Flora Plant brand, with similar launches in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands in early 2024. This innovation marks the beginning of our transition to a paper solution across our portfolio, furthering our aim to reduce plastic content by 80% by 2030.

Where key ingredients are identified as potentially high risk, we maintain strong individual policies designed to address the potential risks inherent in these supply chains, particularly focussing on deforestation and exploitation. One area of particular focus is palm oil, and all our palm oil is certified (segregated and mass balance) by the RSPO. Beyond certification, we continue to use satellite monitoring and have robust grievance management processes to proactively address issues in palm oil supply chains. We are also enhancing our efforts in other areas, including building a more sustainable coconut oil supply chain. We are a member of the Sustainable Coconut Partnership, an organization dedicated to making the coconut sector more resilient and responsible. Additionally, from 2024 onwards, we will begin sourcing Rainforest Alliance-certified coconut oil.

We believe we have an industry leading R&D function that underpins our ability to produce new and innovative products using key ingredient know-how, technically sophisticated equipment and processes across our core categories and products. As an insights-driven organization we seek to continually enhance consumer experience with respect to taste, functionality, health and nutrition, sustainability and affordability by developing relevant product and packaging innovation.

Additionally, we invested approximately €38 million in our new, state-of-the-art Food Science Centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands, which opened its doors in 2022 and which we believe is the largest pure-play plant-based food center in the world. Our Food Science Centre is a dedicated R&D facility solely focused on plant-based food innovation and pioneering the development of plant-based foods and sustainable packaging solutions. The Food Science Centre is at the heart of Food Valley around the Wageningen University and Research campus in the Netherlands, and sits at the core of a leading agri-food ecosystem where there is a deep pool of food science talent and relevant partners across the food value chain. Our team of more than 150 food scientists, food technologists and R&D specialists, including packaging experts, have delivered an upgraded and simplified portfolio of products that offer consumers choice and are designed to compete effectively against plant and dairy products alike across our four core categories. Our team continues to not only develop plant-based foods but also sustainable packaging solutions.

In 2023, along with industry peers, we formed an industry consortium from the total protein value chain in the Netherlands on a new project, called “the FabaFood project”, to advance plant-based protein innovation. For the FabaFood project, which is supported by Efro Oost (a subsidy program for Dutch companies), we will partner on developing new, food-grade varieties of the fava bean, as well as innovative methods of protein extraction and processing. These new proteins can then be incorporated into a range of dairy substitutes that deliver enhanced performance across taste, color, texture and cost.

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that guarantees the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Therefore the Senior Secured Notes will indirectly benefit from the minimum guarantor provisions set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, as amended or restated from time to time. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.” The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, regulatory requirements or restrictions, financial assistance laws, corporate benefit laws, liquidity protection rules, fraudulent preference, “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes.”_ Under the Indenture, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released: - except for the Parent Guarantee, upon the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of ownership interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case, if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Indenture; - except for the Parent Guarantee, upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; - upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement; - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (defined below); - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”; 171 ----- - with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants— Merger and Consolidation— _Guarantors” and the Indenture;_ - with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor; or - in connection with an IPO Pushdown, as specified in the Indenture. Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of certain documents from the Company or the relevant Guarantor, will execute any documents delivered to it by the Company or such relevant Guarantor in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Company, the Issuer, the Trustee nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Senior Secured Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination. Substantially all the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, other than the Issuer, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Company that are not the Issuer. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Issuer and the Guarantors represented (on a consolidated basis, after giving effect to intercompany eliminations and excluding goodwill, intangible assets, investments, deferred taxes and inter-company assets, as applicable) 48.4% of our net sales, 68.7% of our Normalized EBITDA and 51.7% of our total assets. Only certain Subsidiaries organized or incorporated in the Netherlands, Germany, Delaware and England & Wales will guarantee the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description _of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_ The ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to _the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of the Guarantors may not be as favorable to investors as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes from recovering payments due on the Senior Secured Notes.”_ In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted under applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Senior Secured Notes and a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the _Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”_ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. 173 ----- No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the payment of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations secured on a pari passu basis. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description _of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_ The Trustee for the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date will have, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction; and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor, and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request. If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date).

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. 183 ----- If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail or otherwise transmit to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Senior Secured Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control; provided that the purchase date will be no earlier than 10 days from the date a notice of such Change of Control Offer is mailed or otherwise transmitted. If such Change of Control Offer is subject to consummation of a Change of Control, such notice may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time as the Change of Control has been consummated, or such Change of Control Payment may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Change of Control shall not have been consummated; provided that in no case shall the Change of Control Offer have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which the Change of Control Payment occurs. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” expressly permits a third party to obtain control of the Company in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of the Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding have validly tendered and not withdrawn Senior Secured Notes in a Change of Control Offer, Senior Secured Notes owned by an affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of Change of Control Offer. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which any Senior Secured Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of any Senior Secured Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment of borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing Senior Secured Notes 184 ----- in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Company or its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the then existing financial resources of the Company and its Subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer as required by the Indenture and certain transactions will not require us to make a change of control offer.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and written notice of such occurrence is received by a trust officer of the Trustee from the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. 209 ----- The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

This summary deals only with Senior Secured Notes held as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) by U.S. holders (as defined below) who purchase the Senior Secured Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Senior Secured Notes of the applicable series is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler). As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds Senior Secured Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Senior Secured Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: - a dealer in securities or currencies; - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a real estate investment trust; - a tax-exempt organization; - an insurance company; - a person holding the Senior Secured Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle; - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities; - a person liable for alternative minimum tax; - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity); - a person whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the Senior Secured Notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or 258 ----- - a United States expatriate. This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Senior Secured Notes that are different from those discussed below.

Interest income on a Senior Secured Note will generally be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will generally be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Senior Secured Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable in euros. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Senior Secured Notes, determined by translating the amount of foreign currency received (if any) at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the foreign currency so received). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the Senior Secured Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Senior Secured Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or 259 ----- - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Senior Secured Note (including, upon the sale of a Senior Secured Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the amount of foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Your adjusted tax basis in a Senior Secured Note will generally be your cost for that Note. If you purchased a Senior Secured Note with foreign currency, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount of foreign currency paid for such Senior Secured Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the Senior Secured Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros or U.S. dollars (as may be applicable), then your amount realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement or disposition, if the Senior Secured Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Senior Secured Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Senior Secured Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Senior Secured Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Senior Secured Note is your purchase price for the Senior Secured Note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Senior Secured Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Senior Secured Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the Senior Secured Notes include those stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference to, or otherwise be subject to, the Trust Indenture Act. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan. In considering an investment in the Senior Secured Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of Senior Secured Notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Guarantors is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Senior Secured Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 8414 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Senior Secured Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Senior Secured Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Law. Because of the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. 265 ----- Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Senior Secured Note will be deemed to have given the acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.” The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive.

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court, which has jurisdiction to open “main insolvency proceedings” in relation to a company, is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its “center of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the “center of main interests” of a debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” There is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any company or legal person has its “center of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office. The rebuttable presumption that a company has its “center of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and if a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant. Where the “center of main interests” of a company is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized and given effect to (subject to some exceptions) in all the other Member States (other than Denmark), although “secondary proceedings” may be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark), in the circumstances described below. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open secondary proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in _rem include:_ - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; 267 ----- - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of a Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” (before the opening of main insolvency proceedings) or “secondary proceedings” (after the opening of main insolvency proceedings) only in the event that a debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State (not being the Member State in which such debtor has its “center of main interest”). For territorial proceedings only, there is the additional requirement that they can only be opened where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the debtor’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. The effects of “territorial proceedings” or “secondary proceedings” shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the Member State where such proceedings are opened. The determination of whether a company has an “establishment” and where it is situated is also a question of fact and is not a static concept. As such, an establishment could be created and may change from time to time. According to Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, an “establishment” means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in 268 ----- insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries or a Guarantor experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of, and the security granted by, the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries and/or any Guarantor. The insolvency and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or (subject to the framework provided for under the EU Insolvency Regulation) conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2682,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,2682.3,The Netherlands,2682.3.2,General,"There are three insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities: the first, suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. In practice, a suspension of payments often results in bankruptcy. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. The third, a composition outside bankruptcy or moratorium of payments proceedings, allows debtors in (early) financial distress to propose restructuring plans to their creditors and shareholders outside of formal insolvency proceedings, with the prospect of the debtor being able to continue on a going-concern basis. All three insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the principles of these insolvency regimes is set forth below. _Suspension of Payments_ An application for a suspension of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a suspension of payments is filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting of creditors is required to vote on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a suspension of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive suspension of payments. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional suspension of payments ends. The definitive suspension of payments will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than onethird of the number of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The granting of a definitive suspension of payments can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A suspension of payments takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day on which the court has granted the provisional suspension of payments. 269 ----- The suspension of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Under Dutch law secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the company in suspension of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no suspension of payments. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party (which includes the debtor) the court can order a “cooling down period” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in a definitive suspension of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and admitted in the suspension of payments, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the Noteholders to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a Noteholder in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition. Under Dutch law, as soon as a definitive suspension of payments is granted or the composition is ratified by a court, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against the relevant debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect of secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be suspended or cancelled by operation of law. _Bankruptcy_ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. Furthermore, the debtor can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself _provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). There is no legal duty for a debtor to file for its own bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a suspension of payments (see above). As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively from 0.00 hours on the day the order is rendered. During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce a Noteholder’s potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims, need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. The valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the Noteholders may be challenged in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver (curator), the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure). In these proceedings the court will decide whether a claim is valid (and for which amount). Therefore, these proceedings could cause Noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their Senior Secured Notes or less than they could recover in other liquidation proceedings. Such _renvoi_ proceedings could also cause payments to the Noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. Creditors of secured claims and preferential creditors with respect to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets 270 ----- subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified. As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors in the context of voting on a composition in bankruptcy, which is different in WHOA proceedings as described below. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in suspension of payments proceedings the supervisory judge (rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy receiver can force a secured creditor to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs (which may be significant). Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the bankruptcy. To the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer.” Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. As in suspension of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors, which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority in number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself acknowledge the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. _Dutch Scheme_ With the implementation in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act and the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on January 1, 2021, debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is based on the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the U.S. Chapter 11 proceedings and it offers debtors additional possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in moratorium of payments and in bankruptcy proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against a Dutch debtor being compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can, in certain 271 ----- circumstances, extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture and therefore the Senior Secured Notes. Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two thirds of the total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of such creditor. Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of four months, with a possible extension of four months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

For that reason, and to accommodate for the Security Agent holding the security for and on behalf of all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the Holders under or in connection with the Indenture. A pledge under any Dutch security document will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of a Dutch security document posed by Dutch law. However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in Dutch market practice. To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch security document is successfully challenged, Holders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch security document. In addition, the Holders bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The articles of association of each Dutch Guarantor permit the provision of guarantee and security. The articles of association of the Issuer permit the issuing of notes and the granting of security interest. However, the determination of whether a legal act (such as the issuing of a note or the granting of a guarantee or security interest) is within the objects of a company may not be based solely on the description of the articles of association of such company, but must take into account all relevant circumstances, including, in particular, the question of whether the interests of such company are served by the relevant legal act. If the entering into a legal act by a company, in light of the benefits, if any, derived by such company from entering into such legal act, would have an adverse effect on the interest of the company, the legal act may be found to be voidable or the obligation resulting from such legal act unenforceable upon the request of the relevant company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy (faillissement) or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van betaling). As a result, no assurance can be given that a court would conclude that the issuing of the Senior Secured Notes, the granting of the Guarantees or the granting of the security interests over the Collateral is indeed within the corporate object and in the interest of such companies. To the extent that 272 ----- the Issuer, a Dutch Guarantor or the bankruptcy receiver or the administrator of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor successfully invokes the voidability or unenforceability of a Note, a Guarantee or a security interest, such Note, Guarantee or security interest would be limited to the extent any portion of it is not nullified and remains enforceable. If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Whether or not a guarantor is insolvent in the Netherlands, pursuant to Dutch law, payment under a guarantee or following enforcement of foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or not, be withheld under the doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden). Other impeding factors include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set-off (verrekening). In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch Guarantor and security interest provided by the Issuer or Dutch Guarantor may be suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the mention of a holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefore with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, and other entities or persons entitled thereto in the articles of association of, or an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided. According to Dutch case law, a managing director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the managing director on the basis of which the conclusive is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt gemaakt kan worden) for the detriment suffered. The enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions. In proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

In general, in insolvency proceedings, a right of mortgage and/or a right of pledge provides a creditor with the strongest position available under Dutch law in terms of security. A (first ranking) right of mortgage or right of pledge ranks above any other rights of priority available to creditors, including the general priority right of the Dutch tax authorities on the tax debtor’s assets. However, Dutch law provides for certain exceptions. For example, under certain circumstances, the Dutch tax authorities’ priority right ranks above a non-possessory right of pledge over inventory (not including stock (voorraden) found on the premises of the tax debtor (bodemzaken). Schemes often used to interfere with these tax authorities’ priority, most notably the lease of the debtor’s premises (bodemverhuurconstructie), have been restrained by recent legislation. Creditors intending to make use of this scheme now must inform the tax authority of their intention and may not carry out the scheme during a period of four weeks after the moment the tax authorities have been informed. Enforcement of security rights in a Dutch court is subject to the Dutch rules of civil procedure. In addition, foreclosure on security rights created under Dutch law (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Under Dutch law, security rights are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets. This auction has to be effected in accordance with the applicable provisions of The Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and The Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering). Under Dutch law, shares in a Dutch B.V. 273 ----- (private company with limited liability; besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) may only be transferred upon foreclosure in accordance with Dutch law and the relevant pledged company’s articles of association (statuten) as they read at the time of foreclosure. Undisclosed rights of pledge over receivables can, in principle, only be enforced (through collection of the receivable) after the pledge has been disclosed to the debtor. The Security Agent or (unless it has waived such right) the relevant security provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the encumbered assets, instead of a public auction. In the event of pledged assets, the Security Agent and the relevant security provider may agree to an alternative enforcement procedure once the pledge has become enforceable. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the pledged assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The actio pauliana provisions offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplichte rechtshandeling); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed the person and, unless the act was conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery. Also to the extent that Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutadis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security interest involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or the granting of the Guarantees or security rights could be nullified. Consequently, the validity of the Senior Secured Notes, any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Senior Secured Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

As further described in relation to the insolvency considerations for the European Union above, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “center of main interests” as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Guarantors, is likely to be initiated in Germany, and, if a German Guarantor were held to have its “center of main interests” within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of a Guarantor that is not organized under the laws of Germany (for example, if its “center of main interests” is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency proceedings over a Guarantor may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German 274 ----- Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of the recovery of payments due on the Senior Secured Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s “center of main interests” is found to be in a Member State other than Germany. This issue is to be determined at the time when the competent court decides on the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. If a Guarantor’s “center of main interests” is situated in a foreign country (other than a Member State), the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings or secondary insolvency proceedings by a German court will be determined by section 354 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in case of territorial insolvency proceedings or sections 356 et seq. of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in case of secondary insolvency proceedings. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity and certain other requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within a group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. German insolvency law provides for rules facilitating the mastering of group insolvencies. However, they mainly relate to coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. They do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulate four key pillars in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity in insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag). Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or if the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve (12) months (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditors to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft - AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea - SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft _mit beschränkter Haftung - GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder such as the_ German Guarantors becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of overindebtedness at the latest within six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management (and any other person obliged to file for insolvency, as the case may be) to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Senior Secured Notes, may be voidable; this may also apply, under certain conditions, to certain payments before the occurrence of illiquidity or over-indebtedness. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to_ service its payments obligations but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity of the debtor. Insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag), the insolvency court may take 275 ----- preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may, inter alia, prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce judicially individual claims against the debtor’s moveable assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) - an insolvency proceeding in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). The order for opening an insolvency proceeding as debtor-in-possession proceedings requires, _inter alia, that (i) the debtor has enclosed a detailed and coherent self-administration planning (Eigenverwaltungsplanung)_ and (ii) no circumstances are known which indicate that key aspects of the self-administration planning are based on inaccurate facts. In case of debtor-in-possession status is ordered, instead of a preliminary insolvency administrator, a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) will be appointed who shall supervise the management of the debtor in the preliminary insolvency proceedings with debtor-in-possession status (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung). Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to order debtor-inpossession status and if the debtor can prove (by way of a certification provided by a tax advisor, accountant or lawyer with experience in insolvency matters) that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich _aussichtslos), the court shall, upon the request of the debtor, grant a period of up to three (3) months for submission of an_ insolvency plan (so-called protective shield proceedings, Schutzschirmverfahren). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may - upon application of the debtor - be suspended. The preliminary custodian (vorläufiger _Sachwalter) will supervise the process. In this sub-variant of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the debtor is entitled to_ suggest an individual to be appointed as preliminary custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and several other circumstances, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss). The preliminary creditors’ committee will be asked to form a view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; _i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which regularly includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In case the court orders for a debtor-in-possession status, the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter). In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to request the change of the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual be eligible as officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). 276 ----- From the perspective of the Noteholders, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following: - if the court does not order debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose of the assets of such insolvent entity would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter); - if the court does not order debtor in possession status (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the management of such insolvent entity, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of such insolvent entity’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; - claims against such insolvent entity may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator to the extent an insolvency administrator refuses to voluntarily separate such asset from the estate. Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to an agreement to terminate such agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may pursuant to the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) highly dependent on the individual circumstances - be invalid if they frustrate the right of the insolvency administrator to choose whether or not to perform the agreement (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters). This likely also relates to agreements which are not governed by German law. Powers of attorney granted by a debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) opts for performance. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Security interests in the debtor’s assets obtained by way of judicial enforcement action in the last month prior to the request for opening of insolvency proceedings or after such date shall become ineffective upon opening of the proceedings. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In the case of creditors secured by pledges over shares or company interests forming part of the insolvency estate it may depend on the circumstances whether the creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of the pledged shares on their own or whether the insolvency administrator has the right to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. A recent decision by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) pertaining to enforcement of intellectual property rights (transferred as security) can be read to grant secured creditors the enforcement right in case of non-securitized (unverbriefte) shares (such as typically is the case with shares in a German GmbH). 277 ----- In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims - Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. The preferential right (Absonderungsrecht) of a creditor may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right for purposes of the continuation of the debtor’s business. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use. Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law, while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. The unencumbered assets of the debtor serve to satisfy the costs of the insolvency proceeding (Kosten des _Insolvenzverfahrens) first and afterwards the preferred creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger). Typically,_ liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator (or debtor and custodian in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings) after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the insolvency estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). It may take several years before an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors. In insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims of the Noteholders against such German Guarantor under the Guarantees would only rank as unsecured insolvency claim. German insolvency law also provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law. The following subordinated claims shall be satisfied ranking below the unsubordinated claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the respective loan or entered into a legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan; and (vi) claims which the creditor and the debtor agreed to be subordinated in insolvency proceedings. Under certain circumstances, restrictive covenants and undertakings in finance documents may result in the relevant creditor being considered to hold a “shareholder-like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung) in the insolvent entity. In that event, in insolvency proceedings over the assets of such insolvent entity, the claims against that entity would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen) in accordance with the rules applying to shareholder loans. A third party acquiring the claims that are subject to the rules of the treatment of shareholder loans will itself be exposed, inter alia, to an avoidance risk with respect to repayments made within the period of one (1) year prior to the petition to open insolvency proceedings or subsequent to such petition (section 135 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the debtor (and, as the case may be, in transaction security) unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. To the extent any creditor that benefited from transaction security (if any) were deemed to be a subordinated creditor, potential sharing and equalization provisions in the finance documents could result in holders who are not subordinated suffering a shortfall on the amount they recover. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings aiming at the liquidation of the relevant insolvent debtor, the value of the insolvent entity’s assets may be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s 278 ----- business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors can, under certain circumstances, be crammed down). The debtor as insolvent entity may oppose the proposed plan but can be crammed down if the plan is not detrimental to the insolvent company (in comparison to ordinary insolvency proceedings) and if no creditor will receive a higher economic value than the amount of its claim. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan (e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap). In this case, the adoption of the insolvency plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can, under certain circumstances, also be crammed down.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten (10) years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Guarantor or any other entity based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the Noteholders as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support (such as the Guarantees) for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., avoidance rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of insolvency avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In the event and to the extent such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the Noteholders may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditors only. If payments have already been made under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees or the Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that were to be voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the Noteholders would only have a general unsecured claim under the Senior Secured Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect); - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the 279 ----- counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security or has paid for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four (4) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten (10) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; knowledge of the beneficiary of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors is presumed if the beneficiary knew of the debtor’s imminent insolvency (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit), and that the transaction constituted a disadvantage for the other creditors. In the case_ that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four (4) years. In the case that the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor was entitled in that form and at that time, knowledge of such creditor of the intention of the debtor to prejudice its insolvency creditors is (only) presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor, or agreed to deferred payments, establishes the presumption that he or she had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management board or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the last ten (10) years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or provider of surety (Bürge) (in which case not the third party but the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” (Bargeschäft) and may as such be privileged, i.e., under certain circumstances, not being subject to insolvency avoidance under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) in the absence of formal insolvency proceedings. The 280 ----- prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (as amended from time to time, the “Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act”) (Gesetz über den Stabilisierungs- und _Restrukturierungsrahmen für Unternehmen (Unternehmensstabilisierungs- und -restrukturierungsgesetz - StaRUG)),_ which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-insolvency financial restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des _Restrukturierungsvorhabens)._ A debtor’s management can (but is not obliged to) access the new restructuring tools of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor may (but is not obliged to) alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the company is imminently illiquid. Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort), only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Senior Secured Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition, and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can - under certain circumstances - even be used without the need for any public notices despite becoming binding on all affected creditors. The tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately; however, certain tools may be extended to cover security granted by entities that are affiliated entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor. Furthermore, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act replicates the tools available under the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies. The core component of the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-insolvency restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), including, for example, by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates or maturities of liabilities as well as capital measures pertaining to the equity structure. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) the Guarantees and Collateral granted for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. A restructuring plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtor’s creditors. The restructuring plan which can be submitted solely by the debtor will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of at least 75% of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are generally determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if certain creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided that certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross class cramdown). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the restructuring plan (e.g., capital decrease with subsequent capital increase and provisions on the subscription right). In this case, the adoption of the restructuring plan generally also requires the consent of the group of the shareholders. However, the group of dissenting shareholders can, under certain circumstances, also be crammed down. 281 ----- The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which can be granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three (3) months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight (8) months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the Noteholders, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other entity having its “center of main interests” in Germany would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight (8) months due to a stabilization order upon application by the debtor; - any claims and rights of the Noteholders and their Collateral can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (for example, in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra group guarantees and collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective guarantees and collateral, respectively; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Noteholder without the consent of each Noteholder (generally, the relevant majority requirement is 75% of the respective voting rights) and, if the prerequisites for a cross class cramdown are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the Noteholders. Restructuring Proceedings which are public and corresponding restructuring plans confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation as such public Restructuring Proceedings have been included as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of said Regulation. In any other case (i.e., “private” Restructuring Proceedings), recognition of a restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable conflict-of-laws provisions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Therefore, pledges may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest and other accessory interests. Such accessory security interests (i) cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee who does not itself hold the secured claim, (ii) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated and (iii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned. The accessory security interests will be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Senior Secured Notes. The Noteholders on the other hand are creditors under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees but will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the Noteholders from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Security Documents will secure, in particular, a so called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than securing the claims of the Noteholders directly. The pledges governed by German law will therefore directly secure, in particular, the parallel debt. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by a debtor under, in particular, the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture, and any payment in respect of the principal obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding principal obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount due under the Senior Secured Notes, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of the parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under 282 ----- German law to secure such parallel debt. Although it is widely believed that a parallel debt can effectively be secured by a pledge, there are no published court decisions confirming the validity of a parallel debt structure and of the pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts and hence there is no certainty that German courts will uphold such pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. Moreover, the Security Agent does not hold the pledges or the parallel debt in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Noteholders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence, the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

If, at the time of entering into a security agreement, it is already certain that the realizable value of the collateral is significantly out of proportion to the claim secured, the entire German collateral could be regarded as an initially excessive collateralization. Although no specific case law exists, a decision by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) indicates that the loan-to-collateral ratio would be beyond the threshold applied to subsequent excessive collateralization if the value of the collateral is more than 150% of the amount of the secured obligations. Any valuation, however, will be based on the realizable value taking into account any possible discount on the current market value, arising, e.g., from a sale in the then current situation. In addition, the over-collateralization, in order to be regarded as initially excessive, must be based on a creditor’s reprobate attitude (verwerfliche Gesinnung), which is assumed if a creditor, out of self-interest, displays an ethically unbearable recklessness against a debtor. In exceptional circumstances, an excessive loan-to-collateral ratio can, itself, justify the assumption of a reprobate attitude. If the realizable value of the collateral at any date after having been granted not only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured claims by more than 10%, the subsequently excessively secured (nachträglich übersichert) creditor is, according to the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), regularly obliged to release collateral back to the debtor insofar as the estimated realizable value of collateral, which depends on the risks of realization of the collateral and on the market situation, exceeds the secured claim amount by more than such 10%. In order to determine the realizable value of the collateral granted, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) allows for a reduction of the face value of the collateral, thus, permitting that the face value of the collateral is up to 150% of the claim amounts secured from time to time. In case and to the extent that the realizable value of the aggregate collateral exceeds 110% of the secured obligations, the secured creditor would, on demand by the collateral provider, have to release excess collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

KG”), respectively. The granting of a Guarantee or Collateral by such German Guarantor in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company (each such German Guarantor, a “German Subsidiary",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2682,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,2682.5,Guarantor”) is subject to certain provisions relating to the preservation of the statutory capital under the German Limited,2682.5.1,,"Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”). These provisions would also apply to any future guarantor or security grantor incorporated in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG. As a general rule, the provisions of the GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s, or in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG its general partner’s, net assets (i.e., in principle total assets less liabilities and liability reserves) in accordance with the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) would fall below the amount of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or an already negative amount of its net assets would further be reduced. The granting of a Guarantee or security interest by a German Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as payments under any arrangements that are not at arm’s length terms may be considered disbursements under the provisions of the GmbHG. 283 ----- In addition, Section 15b paragraph 5 of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (“Section 15b InsO”) (formerly section 64 GmbHG) prohibits the managing directors (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH to make payments to the shareholders leading to the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the GmbH. Payments towards a guarantee as well as share pledges and any other collateral granted by a GmbH in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered payments to its shareholders in the meaning of Section 15b InsO (formerly section 64 GmbHG). This also applies to limited partnerships with a limited liability company as general partner such as a GmbH & Co. KG. In order to enable a German subsidiary incorporated in the legal form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG to grant guarantees and to provide collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating the provisions of the GmbHG and/or Section 15b InsO (formerly section 64 GmbHG) and to limit any potential personal liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, security documents, indentures and/or guarantees to contain so called “limitation language” in relation to such subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation language,” the secured parties contractually agree, subject to certain exemptions, to enforce the security interests and the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to demand payment under the guarantees against a German subsidiary which is a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG (or to release the proceeds of an enforcement, as applicable) only if and to the extent that such enforcement and payment, respectively, do not result in the subsidiary’s or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG in the general partner’s, net assets falling below the amount of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or increasing such shortfall in order to avoid a violation of the applicable provisions of the GmbHG or with regard to Section 15b InsO (formerly section 64 GmbHG) - in the relevant German Subsidiary Guarantor becoming illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) within the current or subsequent fiscal year and the managing director(s) of the German Subsidiary Guarantor becoming liable pursuant to Section 15b InsO (formerly section 64 GmbHG). Accordingly, the documentation with respect to the Collateral and the Guarantees, to the extent provided by a German Subsidiary Guarantor, contains or will contain such contractual limitation language and such guarantees and security interests are limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or Collateral granted by such German Subsidiary Guarantor can only be enforced to a limited extent or not at all and the Noteholders will lose the benefit of the Guarantees and Collateral, respectively. German capital maintenance, liquidity protection rules and the other provisions referred to above are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Subsidiary Guarantors, which can negatively affect (i) the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Senior Secured Notes, (ii) the ability of a German Subsidiary Guarantor to make payments on the Guarantees or (iii) the ability of the secured parties to enforce the Collateral. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German Subsidiary Guarantor of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Guarantees or Collateral granted by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantees and/or Collateral by a German Subsidiary Guarantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction (for example, a Noteholder) qualifying as a repayment of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the respective German Subsidiary Guarantor of the Guarantees and the Collateral, respectively, could become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of “contra bonos mores” (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that a German Subsidiary Guarantor when granting the Guarantees and/or the Collateral was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Under such circumstances, the Guarantees or the Collateral may also be invalid. German law does not generally permit for the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon the occurrence of an enforcement event in relation to the pledge. The enforcement of a share/interest pledge governed by German law 284 ----- usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements may apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the relevant German Subsidiary Guarantor from foreclosing into and realizing the assets constituting the Collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds from such realization, but not an intervention right (Drittwiderspruchsrecht) (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). Accordingly, the Security Agent and the Noteholders may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other (unsecured) creditors into the Collateral, even if they consider such foreclosure untimely. Moreover, enforcement of the Collateral through the German courts may become time-barred or subject to defenses of setoff or counterclaim.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

However, the EUWA provided for the Recast Insolvency Regulation to continue to apply, as it did pre-IP Day, to insolvency proceedings provided that the main proceedings were opened before IP Day. As such, it appears that the Recast Insolvency Regulation will not continue to apply where only territorial proceedings have been opened before IP Day. Therefore, and provided that the main proceedings were started before IP Day, the UK will continue to recognize insolvency proceedings commenced in Member States, and will receive reciprocal recognition of UK insolvency proceedings. The Insolvency Amendment Regulations, which (with the exception of the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 which came into effect immediately prior to IP Day) came into effect on Exit Day, amend EU insolvency legislation which had direct effect in the United Kingdom. In addition to any other grounds to establish jurisdiction that apply under English law, the post-IP Day Recast Insolvency Regulation (as amended by the Insolvency Amendment Regulations) expressly provides that jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom in respect of a debtor can be established where such proceedings are opened for the purposes of rescue, adjustment of debt, reorganization or liquidation and: - the debtor’s center of main interests (“COMI”) is in the United Kingdom; or - the debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the United Kingdom. These tests are consistent with the Recast Insolvency Regulation for determining the proper jurisdiction for a debtor’s insolvency proceedings and the applicable law to be used in those proceedings. However, the Insolvency Amendment Regulations extend the English court’s jurisdiction (i) provided the court considers there to be a sufficient connection with England and Wales (and that (a) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (b) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction), to wind up any foreign company which might be 285 ----- wound up as an unregistered company under UK insolvency laws, even if its COMI is in a Member State and it has no establishment in the United Kingdom; and (ii) to place a company incorporated in an EEA state, or having its COMI in a Member State, into administration. While the English courts can assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings on these bases, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English _insolvency and restructuring proceedings”)._",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings, based on English insolvency laws, over an English company. In addition, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”), which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) in the United Kingdom and which apply to foreign insolvency proceedings (subject to certain exceptions) anywhere in the world without any condition of reciprocity, provide that certain collective foreign (i.e., non-English) proceedings in respect of an English company may be recognized by the English courts as foreign main proceedings where it has its COMI in that foreign jurisdiction, or as foreign non main proceedings where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should any English company have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the United Kingdom, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit a stay may be requested from the English court). Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. These include, in the case of administration, the company, its directors or a creditor making an application to court for an administration order, or the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) granted by the company and which has become enforceable appointing an administrator out of court, or, in the case of liquidation, by a creditor filing a petition at court to wind up the company or the company resolving by special resolution that it be wound up voluntarily. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Pursuant to the Security Documents, and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles, the Permitted Collateral Liens and certain perfection requirements, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first-ranking basis, on the Issue Date, by the Initial Collateral, and as soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and in any event within 10 days from the Issue Date, by the Additional Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee against an English obligor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of a Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, following an application to court for an administration order, an administration order can only be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 (for a period of 3 weeks) or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The administrator must perform his functions with the objective of rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on Insolvency”). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” granted by the company and which has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). The entitlement of the floating charge holder(s) to receive the proceeds of the realization of the relevant property will be subject to any prior ranking claims in the statutory order of priority, (see “—Priority on Insolvency” ). An administrator may also, with the prior approval of the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator may also dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the consent of the secured creditors. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge granted by the company and which has become enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. The Senior Secured Notes are not secured by a floating charge. In order to empower the chargee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act). This will apply if an English obligor incurs a debt of at least £50,000,000 during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument as well as fulfilling certain other technical requirements). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of any part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29 of the Insolvency Act. The chargee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with any fixed charge security interests, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered by the charge and therefore whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge in respect of a company’s property.” Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court may grant an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Regulations 2003), as set out below. 288 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

If appointed pursuant to the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge that falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations. The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Priority on Insolvency”).",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount which would be realise on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. Under English law there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be created by an English law governed security document as properly taking effect as floating charges; as the description given to security interests by the parties is not determinative. Whether security interests purporting to be fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend on, amongst other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor 289 ----- is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed security interest in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee in the ordinary course, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents. If any fixed security interests are re-characterized as floating security interests, the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

An English obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents include (whether at the outset or following an amendment in accordance with the terms of the documents) an English governing law and/or jurisdiction clause. Further, a number of recent schemes have involved groups causing an existing or newly incorporated English company to assume primary liability (through various means) for financial obligations of the group for the sole purpose of creating the requisite nexus to pursue a scheme (in which the obligations of the existing obligors could be varied). Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not the relevant jurisdictional requirements would be satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the court’s sanction order to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved by the creditors, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to the Registrar of Companies (in the case of UK companies, for the purpose of registration). A scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims against third-parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to other preferential creditors, except with its consent. 290 ----- In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted on in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. A CVA also requires the approval of more than 50% in value of the company’s members present in person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution to approve the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the outcome of the meeting of members differs from the outcome of the meeting of creditors, the decision of the creditors will prevail. Like creditors, members have the right to apply to the court to challenge the approval of a company voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances. Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

While CA06 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. The application of the above Chapter to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Regulations. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out in section 859A(6) of CA06): (i) a charge in favor of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection with the lease of land; (ii) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s; and (iii) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of CA06 by or under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking Act 2009). Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities.

Subject to certain exceptions, the effect of a restrictions notice is that in respect of any relevant interest in the relevant company (as defined in Schedule 1B to CA06, for example, a share in the relevant company): (i) any transfer of (or agreement to transfer) the interest is void; (ii) no rights are exercisable in respect of the interest; (iii) no shares may be issued in right of the interest or in pursuance of an offer made to the interest-holder; and (iv) except in a liquidation, no payment may be made of sums due from the relevant company in respect of the interest, whether in respect of capital or otherwise.

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the Register of Companies. There are two forms of winding- up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) voluntary liquidation, whether members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The key difference between the two types of voluntary liquidation is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. The English court has jurisdiction to wind up a company through compulsory liquidation if it is a company registered in England and Wales, or if it is a foreign company (i) with its COMI in England and Wales, or (ii) with its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales, or (iii) in the case of an unregistered foreign company, if (a) it has enough of a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the English court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up through compulsory liquidation, (b) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefits to those applying for the winding-up order and (c) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the English court can exercise a jurisdiction. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an Member State (except Denmark) but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once the winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will also be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). 292 ----- A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which encapsulates any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to its creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2682,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,2682.7,Collateral Regulations”) (see further below).,2682.7.11,Priority on Insolvency,"One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only; - Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority pre-moratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; - Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); and - Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. 293 ----- Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part (as defined herein) only, unless the cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; - Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge; - Seventh ranking: `o` firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; `o` secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the Noteholders may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and `o` thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This, however, does not include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman Brothers case; and - Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. See “—Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges” above for a description of the Prescribed Part.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

In most cases this will only arise if the company enters administration or liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) after the relevant act. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he or she may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it. _Onset of Insolvency_ 294 ----- The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is made, (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date on which the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ A connected person, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees and security interests: _Transaction at an Undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings. In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees, although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by the court in relation to a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and 295 ----- for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preference_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the security interest or guarantee was granted within the period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees), subject to the same principles as are described above with respect to transactions at an undervalue). However, the court will only make such an order if it is shown that, in deciding to give the preference, the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and that it was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence (it is not open to the connected person to rebut the presumption of insolvency). _Transaction Defrauding Creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue (as outlined above) and was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of such a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the Senior Secured Notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he or she is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate Credit Transaction_ 296 ----- An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Grant of Floating Charge_ Under English insolvency law, if (i) a floating charge is granted by an English company within the period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) ending with the onset of insolvency and (ii) at the time of granting the floating charge or as a consequence thereof, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act), then such floating charge will be invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for the English obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. No application to court by an administrator or liquidator (or any other person) is required to invalidate (in part or in full) the relevant floating charge; any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be invalidated on this basis. As referred to above (see “—Fixed and Floating Charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterized as a floating charge. If purported fixed charge security that is subsequently recharacterized has been granted within the relevant suspect period referred to above, this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration provided.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Financial collateral is defined in the Financial Collateral Regulations as cash, financial instruments or credit claims. The definition of “financial instruments” includes shares in companies and debt instruments such as bonds and claims under loans made by credit institutions. The original primary purpose of the Financial Collateral Regulations was to implement Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 6, 2002 on financial collateral arrangements (OJ 2002 L168/43) in the United Kingdom. The purpose of that directive was to simplify the process of taking financial collateral across the EU by introducing a minimum uniform legal framework. If an arrangement qualifies as a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations, certain modifications or exclusions to English insolvency law apply which (amongst other things) remove restrictions on enforcing security, disapply certain provisions relating to the order of payment of creditors in administration or liquidation and prohibit avoidance by the insolvency office holder of the financial collateral arrangement in certain situations. For example, security interests to which the Financial Collateral Regulations apply are not required to be registered as a registrable charge at Companies House, and are not subject to the statutory moratorium on enforcement of security that would otherwise apply when a company enters into administration. Furthermore, the Financial Collateral Regulations enable the creditor holding the security interest to appropriate (i.e., to become the absolute legal owner of) the financial collateral to which the security interest applies without the need for a court order provided the security interests have 297 ----- become enforceable in accordance with their terms and provided the creditor has been granted the power to appropriate in the relevant contract.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the UK legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include (but are not limited to) the following: (a) _Moratorium The CIGA 2020 introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The CIGA 2020 includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral (see “—Administration,” “—Administration, Administrative Receivership and Floating Charges,” “— _Avoidance of Transactions—Grant of Floating Charge” and “—Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003” above) or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a_ moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official 298 ----- receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of premoratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). (b) _Ipso Facto clauses prohibited The CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of certain termination clauses, and the imposition of certain amended terms, by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include a company voluntary arrangement, winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than by reason of the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, save to the extent that the event entitling the supplier to terminate the contract arose before commencement of the insolvency proceeding (in which case the right to terminate is suspended until the relevant insolvency proceeding, or any immediately succeeding insolvency proceeding, comes to an end). A supplier cannot make it a condition of continued supply during the relevant insolvency proceeding that any outstanding charges in respect of prior supplies are paid. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents, or if the court permits (where it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship). Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services (amongst other types of excluded contracts and parties) are not affected by this new prohibition. (c) _Restructuring plan The CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under CA06, but with a “cross-class cram-down” power that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). 299 ----- Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the plan without their consent. Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e., what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration (or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette).",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in the event that an English obligor goes into liquidation or administration, Noteholders may be subject to exchange rate risk in respect of the non-sterling amount proved between the date on which such English obligor goes into liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such Noteholders may become entitled. The English Supreme Court’s ruling in the Lehman Brothers case established that any such holder of the Senior 300 ----- Secured Notes would not be entitled to make a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of a fall in the value of pounds sterling between the “relevant date” and the date of any distribution.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with an English company in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of CA06 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of CA06 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the Supreme Court has recently held that it takes place when the company in question is insolvent or bordering on insolvency, or when an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable. Security and/or guarantees granted by an English obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are not regarded as insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter position). _Recognition in the European Union_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the transition period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in Member States. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in Member States and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in Member States. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a Member State. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. 302 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

The sale will be made pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between, inter alios, the Issuer, the Guarantors and Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE and KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, as representatives of the Initial Purchasers. The Initial Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes are Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Senior Secured Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Senior Secured Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes to purchasers at the price to investors indicated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Senior Secured Notes, the Initial Purchasers may from time to time vary the offering price and other selling terms without notice. To the extent that any of the Initial Purchasers are not U.S.-registered broker dealers, they will only offer and sell the Senior Secured Notes in the United States through U.S.-registered broker dealers or affiliates, as appropriate. In addition, the Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Senior Secured Notes outside the U.S. through certain of their affiliates. The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments which the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain expenses of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has made certain representations and given certain warranties in respect of its legal and financial matters. The Initial Purchasers are entitled, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Purchase Agreement. In such event, no Senior Secured Notes will be delivered to investors. The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that have a tenor of more than one year (other than the Senior Secured Notes) during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 60 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers. No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about, and to observe, any restrictions relating to the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resales of the Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer _Restrictions.”_ The Senior Secured Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has been advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes but are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured _Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in which case an investor’s ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes may be limited.”_ The Stabilization Manager may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Stabilization Manager. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve 303 ----- purchases of the Senior Secured Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Senior Secured Notes. These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Senior Secured Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Senior Secured Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Stabilization Manager of a greater number of Senior Secured Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Senior Secured Notes while the offering of the Senior Secured Notes is in progress. These activities by the Stabilization Manager, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Senior Secured Notes. As a result, the price of the Senior Secured Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Persons who purchase Senior Secured Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes, and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any applicable securities laws of any state or territory of the United States. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Initial Purchasers will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers or pursuant to offers and sales to nonU.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this Offering and the Issue Date, an offer or sale of the Senior Secured Notes (including the Guarantees) within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.” The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering, selling or distributing the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Senior Secured Notes. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Senior Secured Notes (an “EEA Distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, an EEA Distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. 304 ----- Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Senior Secured Notes (a “UK Distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a UK Distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Senior Secured Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Senior Secured Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and - any Senior Secured Notes will only be offered in the Netherlands to qualified investors (as defined in the Prospectus Directive), unless such offer is made in accordance with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht). Any offer or sale in the U.S. will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker-dealers registered under the U.S. Exchange Act. We expect that delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made to investors against payment on the Senior Secured Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be        business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”)) following the date of pricing of the Senior Secured Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next successive business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Senior Secured Notes will initially settle         business days following the date of this Offering Memorandum, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Issuer and its affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may have a lending relationship with us, including under the Senior Credit Facilities, and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold Senior Dollar Notes or Senior Euro Notes, which are subject to the redemption described under “Summary—Transactions.” To the extent the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates hold any Senior Dollar Notes or Senior Euro Notes, they may receive payment in connection with the redemption of the Senior Dollar Notes or the Senior Euro Notes. Funds advised by KKR that indirectly own an equity interest in the Issuer are affiliates of KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, which is acting as an Initial Purchaser in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited may therefore be deemed to be our affiliate and have a conflict of interest with us. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their 305 ----- customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 306 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without substantive re-examination or re-litigation on the merits if (a) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (d) the foreign judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin—final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency but enforcement is executed in euros at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands. Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
657,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.2,Germany,145.2.1,,"Civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the Unites States may, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts, not be enforceable in Germany. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, under applicable legal rules, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgement by a U.S. court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgements if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in Sections 723(2), 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung) exist: 314 ----- - the judgment is not final under U.S. law; or - U.S. courts would not have had jurisdiction over the case based on the principles on jurisdictional competences under German law; or - the defendant did not appear in the proceedings and invokes such lack of appearance, and the document introducing the proceedings was not duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; or - the judgment conflicts with (i) any prior judgment rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment rendered by another foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; or - the proceedings resulting in the judgment to be recognized are irreconcilable with previously pending proceedings in a German court; or - the recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court would be in conflict with German public policy, including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); or - reciprocity is not guaranteed (i.e., the courts of the country where the judgement was issued would not recognize and enforce a comparable judgement by a German court in equivalent circumstances). Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities, such as the Noteholders, may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium, as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally. It should be noted that German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. It is uncertain whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. However, if an original action is brought before a German court, and the court does not decline jurisdiction, the court may apply not only EU and German rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of the EU and the German law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. federal and state law provisions, particularly those relating to certain remedies, if the relevant application violates German public policy. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. As far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may compel the extensive production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses prior to trial. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor a final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new suit in the same matter in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment inconsistent with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States, but the latitude to deviate from the foreign judgment is limited. The German court is free to issue a completely new decision if there are grounds for non-recognition under 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, but must otherwise take the foreign decision into account, i.e., the foreign judgement has a certain binding effect.",N/A,as_expected,2024,344

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In 315 ----- order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, the English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court and/or enforce a judgment, provided that (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that the defense to it has no real prospect of success and there is no other compelling reason for trial). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy; - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the English enforcement proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a U.S. court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in civil and commercial matters. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. 316 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,344
