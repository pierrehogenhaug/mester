In accessing the preliminary offering memorandum, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions, including any modifications to them any time you receive any information from the Issuer as a result of such access. The preliminary offering memorandum has been prepared in connection with the proposed offer and sale of the securities (including the guarantees) described herein. The preliminary offering memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed, published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by recipients to any other person.

THE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD WITHIN THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE OR LOCAL SECURITIES LAWS. THE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM MAY NOT BE FORWARDED OR DISTRIBUTED TO ANY OTHER PERSON AND MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER. ANY FORWARDING, DISTRIBUTION OR REPRODUCTION OF THIS DOCUMENT IN WHOLE OR IN PART IS UNAUTHORIZED. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS DIRECTIVE MAY RESULT IN A VIOLATION OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OR THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS. IF YOU HAVE GAINED ACCESS TO THIS TRANSMISSION CONTRARY TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE ANY OF THE NOTES DESCRIBED HEREIN. _Confirmation of your representation: In order to be eligible to view the preliminary offering_ memorandum or make an investment decision with respect to the securities, you must be either (1) a QIB or (2) outside the United States purchasing securities in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S, provided that investors in a Member State of the European Economic Area must not be a retail investor. For the purposes of this provision the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. The preliminary offering memorandum is being sent at your request. By accessing the preliminary offering memorandum or accepting an e-mail with the preliminary offering memorandum attached, you shall be deemed to have represented to the Issuer and the initial purchasers named as such in the attached preliminary offering memorandum (the “Initial Purchasers”) that: (1) you consent to delivery of such preliminary offering memorandum by electronic transmission; and (2) either: (a) you and any customers you represent are QIBs; or (b) the e-mail address that you gave the Issuer and to which the e-mail has been delivered is not located, and will not be deemed to be located, in the United States, its territories and possessions (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island and the Northern Mariana Islands), any State of the United States or the District of Columbia. Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A. ----- The notes described in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Notes”) are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This preliminary offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This preliminary offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive. No prospectus is required in accordance with the Prospectus Directive for this issue of Notes. Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the EEA will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor. For the purposes of this provision the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates and others will rely upon the trust and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and agreement. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. You are reminded that the preliminary offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person into whose possession the preliminary offering memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located, and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the preliminary offering memorandum to any other person.

The BCS legal entities combined and carved-out in these financial statements are listed in note 21 of the Financial Statements. Furthermore, the supply chain companies, factories and marketing and sales organizations operated by Unilever run both spreads and non-spreads activities. The Financial Statements have therefore been prepared on a combined and carve-out basis from Unilever’s consolidated financial statements for the purpose of presenting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the spreads business as set forth under “—Basis of Preparation” below. The combined carve-out Financial Statements include every territory in which Unilever operates spreads-related business activities, except for South Africa.

The combined carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with this basis of preparation, which is consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and as issued by the IASB, except as set out below: - IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB do not provide for the preparation of combined carve-out financial statements and accordingly in preparing the combined carve-out Financial Statements certain accounting conventions commonly used for the preparation of historical financial information for inclusion in investment circulars as described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standards applicable to public reporting engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board have been applied. Further details on the application of these accounting conventions can be found below and in the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Explanation of Certain Income Statement Items” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Explanation of Certain Balance Sheet Items.”_ x ----- The combined carve-out Financial Statements: - have been prepared by combining and carving-out the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that management have determined relate to Unilever’s spreads business. Those amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the Unilever entities running spreads activities, which also include allocations and recharges by Unilever of indirect central costs and general corporate expenses. The underlying financial records of Unilever are maintained in accordance with EU and IASB IFRS; - include a cash flow statement showing movement arising from operating, investing and financing activities of the spreads business that is independent of Unilever’s centralized approach to cash management and financing; and - disclose the cumulative investment of Unilever in the spreads business as net parent (deficit) / investment. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that management have determined relate to Unilever’s spreads business include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the spreads business, together with an allocation of the items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out Financial Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. Those are described in more detail in the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition_ _and_ _Results_ _of_ _Operations—Explanation of_ _Certain_ _Income_ _Statement_ _Items”_ and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Explanation of Certain Balance Sheet Items.”_ The combined carve-out Financial Statements apply consistently, unless otherwise stated, the accounting policies, the material estimates and judgments made that are disclosed therein.

Please see “Summary _Historical_ _and_ _Other_ _Financial _Information—Other Key Financial and Operating Information—Summary Pro Forma Data of the Issuer.” As used in this Offering Memorandum, this information includes:_ - **Underlying Sales Growth: Underlying Sales Growth or USG represents turnover for the period on a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals. The constant currency exchange rate is calculated using the measures described below under “—Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures.” - **EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments: EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments represents net profit before taxation, net interest cost, amortisation of intangible assets—direct, depreciation of property, plant and equipment—direct and exceptional bonus and share-based payments adjustment. xi ----- - **Normalized EBITDA: Normalized EBITDA represents EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments, adjusted for non-underlying items, Portuguese Joint Venture adjustment, allocated amortisation of intangible assets, allocated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and finance costs related to pension and similar obligations. For purposes of calculating Normalized EBITDA, “Portuguese Joint Venture adjustment” reflects the recognition of the non-Unilever share of net profit of the joint venture and the interest, tax, depreciation and amortization relating to that joint venture. Management believes that Normalized EBITDA is a helpful indicator of the underlying performance of the pre-separation business, as it adjusts EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments principally for non-underlying items comprised of restructuring costs such as those arising from the consolidation of multiple U.S. factories into one facility at New Century, Kansas. - **_Pro forma Normalized EBITDA: pro forma Normalized EBITDA represents Normalized EBITDA adjusted to reflect: (i) Carve-out adjustments from day one; (ii) Implemented 2017 savings initiatives; (iii) Completion Date SG&A cost savings, (iv) Impact of commodity prices, (v) sharebased payments adjustment and (vi) other adjustments (see note n to footnote 4 to the table in “Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information—Other Key Financial and _Operating Information”)._ Management believes that pro forma Normalized EBITDA is a helpful indicator of the underlying performance and profitability of the business as it takes into account cost savings and other adjustments associated with the implementation of its strategic plan and separation from Unilever. - **Normalized EBITDA margin: Normalized EBITDA margin for any given region represents Normalized EBITDA (and including or excluding completion date SG&A cost savings, as the case may be) for that region divided by turnover for that region, expressed as a percentage. - **_Pro forma Normalized EBITDA margin: Pro forma Normalized EBITDA margin for any given region represents pro forma Normalized EBITDA for that region divided by turnover for that region after deducting the Distributor model adjustment applicable for that region (see note i to footnote 4 to the table in “Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information—Other Key _Financial and Operating Information”), expressed as a percentage._ - **Underlying free cash flow and Underlying free cash flow conversion ratio: Underlying free cash flow represents Cash flow from operating activities (i) plus a Portuguese joint venture adjustment, (ii) plus provisions less payments, (iii) less elimination of losses on disposals, (iv) less non-cash charge for share-based payments, (v) plus non-underlying items within operating profit, (vi) plus other adjustments from cash flow statement, (vii) less capital expenditure, (viii) exceptional bonus and share-based payment adjustment. Underlying free cash flow conversion ratio is calculated by dividing Underlying free cash flow by Normalized EBITDA, and expressing the result as a percentage. Management believes that Underlying free cash flow and the Underlying free cash flow conversion ratio are a helpful indicators of the fundamental cash generative ability of the business on a steady-state basis. - **Constant currency exchange rate: See “—Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures.” Management believes that constant exchange rate measures are helpful indicators of the underlying performance of the business. FFG’s management believes that the foregoing non-IFRS financial measures are helpful indicators of the underlying performance and profitability of the business. Management believes that the foregoing non-IFRS Financial measures are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of FFG’s operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and, because these measures are used by management to track business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions. In addition, management believes that these measures are commonly used by investors, security analysts and other interested parties in FFG’s industry as supplemental measures of operating performance and liquidity. Although the Issuer is presenting these measures to enhance the understanding of FFG’s historical operating performance, they should not be considered alternatives to operating profit as an indicator of operating performance, or alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity. xii ----- You should not consider Underlying Sales Growth, EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments, Normalized EBITDA, pro forma Normalized EBITDA, Underlying free cash flow, constant exchange rate measures or any other non-IFRS measures presented herein as alternatives to measures of financial performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such as operating profit, as a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Underlying Sales Growth, EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments, Normalized EBITDA, pro forma Normalized EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under IFRS. In addition, the Issuer’s computation of EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments, Normalized EBITDA, pro forma Normalized EBITDA and other non-IFRS financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures or ratios used by other companies. EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments, Normalized EBITDA, pro forma Normalized EBITDA and Underlying free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider any of them in isolation. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements. Our presentation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA has additional limitations as an analytical tool. For example, pro forma Normalized EBITDA does not reflect expenses and capital expenditures that FFG expects to incur to transition to a stand-alone business, which we currently estimate will be approximately €200 million in transition-related expenses and one time expenditures, including approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs that we expect FFG to incur as it transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform, and approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as certain manufacturing and management functions are separated from Unilever and relocated (before any offsetting gains from land sales are considered). The substantial majority of these expenses are expected to be incurred over an extended period, up to an including the year ending December 31, 2019. Such measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have not been audited or prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of financial information in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC which would apply if the offering of the Notes were being registered with the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of the financial information included herein.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,” “estimates,” “aims,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “plans,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “future,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “guidance,” “target,” “seek,” “could” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies, plans, objectives, targets, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts; they include statements about the Issuer’s beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements that concern, among other things: - strategies, outlook and growth prospects; - future plans and potential for growth; - trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; - our ability to realize cost-savings as a stand-alone business; - trends and developments affecting the markets in which FFG operates; - our liquidity, capital resources and capital expenditure; - the general economic outlook and industry trends; competition in areas of our business; and - our plans to launch new or expand existing products and services. These forward-looking statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to the Issuer’s management. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as at the date they are made, and the Issuer undertakes no obligation to update any of them in light of new information or future events. Although the Issuer believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. FFG’s actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: - our separation from Unilever; - historical results failing to predict future results as a separate stand-alone company; - assumptions used to calculate pro forma Normalized EBITDA; - decrease in purchasing power following our separation from Unilever; - decrease in selling power following our separation from Unilever; - temporary increase in working capital needs following our separation from Unilever; - changes in payment terms affecting our working capital position following the separation; - an inability to retain and hire employees and assets following the separation; - an inability to succeed Unilever under all joint ventures, contracts and licenses; - loss of key intellectual property rights following the separation; - failure to establish a strong corporate identity; - assumptions relating to the separation; - our ability to successfully implement our business plan; - our lack of control over FFG until the consummation of the Acquisition; - reliance on representations and warranties provided by Unilever; vii ----- - consequence of amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement; - transaction and separation costs as a result of the Acquisition; - limited assets of the Issuer until the consummation of the Acquisition; - requirement to redeem the notes if the Deposit Accounts release conditions are not satisfied; - the Issuer’s financial dependence on receiving distributions from its Subsidiaries; - competitive dynamics in our industry; - established negative trends in the B&M market and changes in consumer tastes and preferences; - growth in market share of butter in the B&M market; - reputational damage and the health of our brands; - uncertainties with respect to the development of new products; - failure to manage our supply chain; - risks in operating manufacturing facilities and relying on third-party manufacturers; - wage increases or work stoppages; - risks associated with our information technology systems; - fluctuations in the cost and availability of our key raw materials; - an inability to pass on price increases; - our relationships with key customers; - credit risk with respect to key customers and suppliers; - inadequate protection of our intellectual property; - adverse developments with respect to the safety and quality of our products; - seasonal fluctuations in demand; - potential liabilities and costs from litigation; - economic and political conditions in our key markets; - adverse changes to the tax regimes to which we are subject and determinations of tax regulators that result in adverse tax consequences; - risks associated with growth and business development initiatives; - risks associated with the exit of the U.K. from the EU; - risks related to retention of key executives and managers; - compliance obligations related to governmental directives and regulations; - liability risks and compliance obligations related to environmental, health and safety matters; - fluctuations in currency exchange rates; - insufficient insurance coverage; - restrictions on the deduction of interest expenses; - adverse effect of transfer pricing rules; - risks related to ownership; or - other risks associated with the Notes, FFG’s indebtedness and its structure discussed under “Risk _Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ The foregoing factors and others described under “Risk Factors” should not be construed as exhaustive. Due to such uncertainties and risks, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as at the date of this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer urges you to read this Offering Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and viii ----- “Business,” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect its future performance and the industry in which it operates. Moreover, FFG operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. It may face new risks from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all such risks; nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The Issuer undertakes no obligation, and does not intend, to release publicly the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Offering Memorandum, including changes in its business or strategy or planned capital expenditure, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. ix -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Unless otherwise stated, industry data in this Offering Memorandum from Euromonitor International, Nielsen, Millward Brown, Kantar Worldpanel, BMI Research (a Fitch Group Company) and GlobalData Plc. (collectively the “Industry Data Providers” and each individually an “Industry Data Provider”) was sourced at various points in time, from April 2017 to September 2017, and, in each instance, reflects the data available at such point in time and does not reflect further updates after it was sourced. To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology is by nature forward-looking and speculative. In particular, no responsibility or liability can be accepted by any Industry Data Provider or any of its affiliates, nor any of its directors nor employees for any errors or omissions in any data from the Industry Data Providers included in this Offering Memorandum nor for any loss arising from reliance placed on such data. When information in this Offering Memorandum is attributed to multiple external sources, including one or more Industry Data Providers, such information is based on FFG’s analysis thereof. We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in our studies, publications and financial information, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third-party sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of data on which our estimates are based. This Offering Memorandum also contains estimations of market data and information derived from such data that cannot be obtained from publications by market research institutes or from other independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own market observations, the evaluation of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or internal assessments. We believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from such data helps investors to better understand the industry we operate in and our position within it. Our own estimates have not been checked or verified externally. We nevertheless believe that our own market observations are reliable. We give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from future studies conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources. xv -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG’s principal product line is Plant-Based Spreads, which accounted for 83% of its turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017. This is complemented by its line of dairy cream alternatives, which represented 6% of turnover for the same period, Liquids products (including liquid margarine, vegetable cooking oils and olive oil), which represented 7% of turnover for the same period, and other products which represented 4% of turnover for the same period. FFG is a market leader in North America and Western Europe and has a strong presence across emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia with number one positions in 44 of its 69 markets. In each of these countries, FFG sells its products predominantly to retail outlets, including to many of the world’s largest retailers and their chains of supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and e-commerce platforms, as well as to wholesalers. FFG also supplies the foodservice channel, including restaurants, hotels, workplace and educational canteens and healthcare facilities. In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, FFG had turnover of €3,294.9 million, €3,031.7 million and €2,904.9 million, respectively, net profit of €453.6 million, €422.5 million and €565.1 million, respectively, and Normalized EBITDA of €723.0 million, €686.3 million and €674.0 million, respectively.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Strengths,9.2.1,Number one player globally with a leading portfolio of iconic brands,"FFG has a strong portfolio of diversified, iconic brands that are well represented across both developed and emerging markets. In the year ended December 31, 2016, FFG had an approximately 32% share of the global margarine market and, within the global B&M category, was more than four times larger than the number two player. Across its core developed markets, FFG has very strong market positioning, with a share of the margarine segment greater than 50% in the U.S.A (59%), Germany (63%), the U.K. (57%) and the Netherlands (74%) in the year ended December 31, 2016, based on retail sales value. With a history of manufacturing and distributing category-leading products for nearly 150 years, FFG has an established global position with demonstrable brand recognition and customer loyalty. FFG has seven brands with a turnover of at least €175 million. These brands are Becel (2017 turnover: €327 million), Rama (2017 turnover: €321 million), Blue Band (2017 turnover: €254 million), Country 1 ----- Crock (2017 turnover: €242 million), Flora (2017 turnover: €208 million), I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! (2017 turnover: €197 million) and ProActiv (2017 turnover: €175 million). FFG’s portfolio benefits from strong brand equity, enjoying an average aided brand awareness of approximately 89% (in 2016), according to Millward Brown, making them some of the most recognizable packaged food brands in their respective markets. FFG’s brand range targets specific and distinct sub-categories within the B&M segment, such as family nutrition, heart health, cholesterol lowering, taste, cooking & baking, and value. The comprehensive range offered means that FFG caters for specific consumption across all main use occasions (spreading, cooking and baking), formats (wrappers, tubs and liquids) and storing conditions (chilled, ambient and tropical ambient products).

External factors External factors which have contributed to developed market underperformance include: - a moderate reduction in consumption occasions (e.g. bread consumption) in some developed markets; - consumer misconception around the healthiness of margarine relative to butter (in particular due to legacy concerns around partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, which have not been included in any of FFG’s products since 2012); and - a period of depressed European butter prices from the second half of 2014 through the first half of 2017 due to the removal of dairy quotas in Europe and the imposition of the Russian trade embargo on some European dairy products, resulting in a reduction in the differential between margarine and butter prices, which has since reversed by the end of 2017. Internal factors As part of Unilever, FFG was constrained in its ability to develop an independent growth strategy. The spreads category was not a core strategic priority for Unilever. As a result, until the internal reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities and the creation of the current dedicated management structure in 2015, the business had not been given sufficient management focus and was run primarily to maintain margin and generate cash flows to enable investment in other areas of Unilever’s business. These internal constraints included: - a limited response to changing consumer preferences toward naturalness and taste; - a lack of response to category shifts and insufficient investment through marketing and new product launches; and - absence of a dedicated sales function and category leadership, with a limited focus on the business as part of the ongoing dialogue with retailers despite Unilever’s significant market shares in each of its core geographies, which resulted in lack of retailer engagement and investment in growing the category. Since the internal reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities 2015, FFG’s management have developed and commenced implementation of a comprehensive strategy to stabilize the developed markets business and support a return to moderate growth. This strategy is clearly centered on the importance of restoring the naturalness and health perception of FFG’s key products, clearly defining the specific strategy for each brand, and improving the taste profile of FFG products. In order to deliver these initiatives, FFG intends to make a one-time brand and marketing investment of €175 million in total over the short to medium term. 6 ----- In order to “revitalize the core” of its business, FFG management believes there are a number of key areas that can be readily addressed with increased focus and attention: _Naturalness and Health_ Management intends to re-align the consumer perception of margarine on the grounds of relative health benefits to butter and the product’s overall naturalness. Margarine is fundamentally a natural, plant-based product, and this message will be at the core of FFG’s marketing campaign aiming to educate the public on margarine’s advantages over butter. A key component of FFG’s strategy is to communicate more clearly the natural and healthy credentials of margarine to consumers, enabled by more effectively leveraging key influencers such as social media personalities and environmental and animal welfare groups to capture the growing plant-based nutrition trend and transitioning to clean labels on key product ranges. FFG plans to advance innovation focused on improving natural credentials in its core range and to redesign packaging of these products to increase naturalness cues, with the potential to move to paper wrap and biodegradable or transparent packaging that align more closely with the interests of modern consumers. Notably, five out of FFG’s six key products do not currently have a clean-label offering (Country Crock in the U.S.A. moved to clean label in 2015). This represents a significant opportunity for FFG to invest in ensuring that its core family focused product offering contains no artificial ingredients, thereby enhancing consumer perceptions of naturalness. _Brand_ Management intends to focus on developing FFG’s brand portfolio to clarify the use occasion positioning and price architecture of its key brands. Management believes these measures will enable more effective targeting of key consumer groups looking for specific features from their products, such as plant-based nutrition or dairy-like taste, and clarity around use occasions, such as spreading, cooking or baking. For example, FFG has begun to reposition the Country Crock brand in the U.S.A. around the focused attributes of “plant-based” and naturalness through the introduction of a clean-label product recipe, as well as marketing and packaging initiatives that have demonstrated positive traction with consumers. _Taste_ Under Unilever ownership, a strong focus on heart health imposed by internal corporate guidelines led to significant reductions in fat content, which impacted overall taste and “mouth-feel”. Going forward, FFG will refocus on taste through improving formulations, as well as selectively increasing fat levels in certain products. In this way, the taste profile of FFG’s Plant-Based Spreads will be improved without changing the overall ingredient composition and, through rollout of upgraded recipes and additional variants, FFG intends to target specific groups of consumers looking for different flavor profiles (for example, mélanges for butter consumers). Management has started to implement this strategy in certain brands over the last 12-24 months with positive initial results. The Rama brand, for example, has undergone significant repositioning and product variation with a 100% plant-based core brand and the introduction of a distinct “with butter” range. Relaunched in December 2016, the brand has seen an underlying sales growth increase of 5.8% by the quarter ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016. Based on these strategies for the developed markets, and with the aid of a dedicated and focused sales force, FFG, as the largest player, expects to both drive stabilization of the margarine category overall as well as win share from its key competitors. 7 ----- The factors which have resulted in historical underperformance in FFG’s developed markets have been clearly identified, relating partly to external factors that have impacted the performance of the overall margarine category and partly to internal constraints resulting from the business’ historical ownership by Unilever.

KKR, management and thirdparty diligence providers have conducted a comprehensive and granular review of FFG’s operating model. We believe that as a stand-alone business, FFG will be able to realize significant cost savings through the implementation of its business transformation strategy based on its track record of delivering efficiencies. Through this process, a number of cost efficiency levers have been clearly identified relating to the five following areas: (i) procurement; (ii) manufacturing; (iii) supply chain; (iv) brand, marketing and investment (“BMI”) and (v) SG&A optimization. The Issuer estimates that these represent, in the aggregate, an annual run-rate cost savings of approximately €200 million, which the Issuer believes can be achieved over the medium term with the incurrence of approximately €45 million to €50 million of non-recurring restructuring and related costs. The five areas of cost optimization are outlined further below: _Procurement and design to value_ Procurement within Unilever has been largely centralized and was outside of the control of FFG management, thereby providing significant scope to transition to best practices within the procurement function. The key raw materials (palm, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and canola oils) are primarily sourced from six large suppliers with purchases covering requirements for the next 12 to 24 weeks. The current procurement policies lack focus on volume consolidation and strategic sourcing partnerships and do not fully exploit potential discount opportunities. Management believes that FFG’s major suppliers are keen to secure volumes due to their relatively low margins and the large costs associated with having to scale production up or down and there is therefore a significant cost saving opportunity for FFG through volume bundling, entering into longer-term contracts and tendering competitively across major suppliers. Packaging-related cost savings entail the application of design-to-value principles and best-practice procurement principles. Through design-to-value, FFG will be able to identify product features that consumers value most in order to optimize the cost structure while still addressing key demand drivers. Examples include simplifying the packaging of key products (s.a. moving away from aluminum foil to lighter materials and reducing the lid thickness), which would enable FFG to save costs without impacting customer perception and product appeal. Separately, FFG intends to adopt best-practice procurement principles via entering into competitive tender processes and global consolidation with scaled suppliers in order to optimize packaging input costs. 9 ----- We believe that the largest cost efficiency opportunity of the five identified above will be in procurement. _Manufacturing cost optimization_ Post carve-out cost efficiencies are anticipated across the manufacturing network. On a carve-out basis, FFG operated in Europe with an average unconstrained utilization rate of 49% in the year ended December 31, 2016, with production costs varying significantly throughout the European manufacturing base from €76/ton to €270/ton. Other identified areas for manufacturing-related cost savings include (i) enhanced planning and staffing especially since multiple machines are running at low capacity, (ii) technology upgrades and use of more energy-efficient machinery/processes, (iii) launch of preventive maintenance programs and (iv) reduction of scrap and waste levels. We believe that the second largest cost efficiency opportunity of the five identified above will be in manufacturing. _Supply chain cost optimization_ Following the Acquisition, FFG’s European distribution network will comprise 18 distribution centers. FFG currently serves almost every European country from local warehouses with limited cross-border or direct shipments to customers. As a result, we believe that there are significant distribution structure overlaps/duplications in certain countries. Separately, management believes that the supply chain costs could be further optimized via competitive tendering of transport lanes, re-designing routes based on FFG’s streamlined distribution network and increasing the share of direct shipments to customers. _BMI optimization_ FFG’s BMI spend for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 was 7.3% of revenue, above the range among peers in the wider consumer sector of between 2.3% to 5.8%. Within Unilever, current BMI spend is generally split across countries by their respective share of FFG’s total revenue, and essentially supports the entire portfolio of brands. The Issuer and its third-party commercial advisers have reviewed current spend practices in BMI on a bottom-up basis and identified opportunities to optimize marketing spend practices. We intend to reduce BMI spend as a percent of turnover through several key initiatives, including: (i) reallocation of budget to more effective marketing channels including digital, (ii) better execution across all channels by exploring tactical media planning levers and (iii) optimization of spend through working with more agile, smaller agencies. In order to deliver these initiatives, we intend to make an incremental one-time brand and marketing investment of up to €175 million in total, over the short to medium term. _SG&A optimization_ KKR has performed a top down benchmarking exercise of SG&A overhead costs (which excludes BMI), which accounted for 10.9% of our revenue in 2017, and a bottom-up review of organizational design. As part of the Acquisition, FFG will set up central standalone operations for Finance, IT, Marketing, HR, Procurement and Legal functions. This exercise would entail hiring in excess of 500 staff across key support functions. Levers to optimize the cost structure include (i) right-sizing G&A support organization to peer efficiency benchmark level, (ii) strengthening of Customer Development during transition and optimizing to peer efficiency level and (iii) streamlining of research and development portfolio and local organization, including focusing on key cross-country innovation and adding skills such as value packaging engineering.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,2686,U.K.,2686.3,FFG relative share (expressed as a multiple) Country** **FFG market share #2 branded player market share,2686.3.2,Exploit positive trends in Foodservice,"While FFG is a key player in the global retail channel with an approximately 32% share of the global margarine & spreads category, FFG has a limited presence in the foodservice channel, as pursuing this route-to-market channel was not previously a key focus under Unilever ownership. Operating as a standalone business, FFG is well positioned to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities in 10 ----- the global foodservice channel. Foodservice has grown faster than retail due to two main reasons. The first is the shift towards out-of-house eating within developed markets; “eating out” grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3% per annum between 2014 and 2016. The second is the structurally lower exposure to changing consumer factors – consumer perceptions regarding the “naturalness” of margarine have less of an impact on the purchasing decisions made by foodservice operators. As typical use cases for margarine in foodservice relate to cooking and baking, where the presence of margarine in the final product is not apparent, factors such as declining use occasions for spreading due to declining bread consumption, misinformed perception of margarine’s health benefits and taste issues have not impacted the foodservice channel, which has shown its resilience. There is significant potential for FFG to increase its presence within the foodservice channel, using its retail platform to fast-track its expansion into this segment. FFG currently participates only in the social and commercial channel within the foodservice channel (e.g. hotels, restaurants and institutional canteens) which is primarily a branded sub-category that accounted for approximately 34% of the non-retail B&M category globally in 2016. The unbranded artisanal and industrial channels, which together represented approximately 65% of the total non-retail category globally in 2016, provide a significant and under-explored opportunity. Management believes there is a significant opportunity to expand penetration of the foodservice channel through FFG’s existing business infrastructure. The capacity available across FFG’s current manufacturing and supply chain network will enable FFG to complement its retail footprint with an expanded foodservice offering, particularly by concentrating on direct sales to the largest end users and by pursuing relationships with selected wholesalers that have a foodservice focus. The demonstrable functional and cost benefits of FFG’s products, including DCA’s longer shelf life and value compared with dairy products, and ability to withstand high temperatures and acidity levels without splitting, as well as FFG’s ability to produce allergen-free products and the products’ favorable cost comparison to butter, position the business strongly to take advantage of this growing channel. While FFG is a key player in the global retail channel with an approximately 32% share of the global margarine & spreads category, FFG has a limited presence in the foodservice channel, as pursuing this route-to-market channel was not previously a key focus under Unilever ownership. Operating as a standalone business, FFG is well positioned to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities in the global foodservice channel. Foodservice has grown faster than retail due to two main reasons. The first is the shift towards out-of-house eating within developed markets; “eating out” grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3% per annum between 2014 and 2016. The second is the structurally lower exposure to changing consumer factors – consumer perceptions regarding the “naturalness” of margarine have less of an impact on the purchasing decisions made by foodservice operators. As typical use cases for margarine in foodservice relate to cooking and baking, where the presence of margarine in the final product is not apparent, factors such as declining use occasions for spreading due to declining bread consumption, misinformed perception of margarine’s health benefits and taste issues have not impacted the foodservice channel, which has shown its resilience. There is significant potential for FFG to increase its presence within the foodservice channel, using its retail platform to fast-track its expansion into this segment. FFG currently participates only in the social and commercial channel within the foodservice channel (e.g. hotels, restaurants and institutional canteens) which is primarily a branded sub-category that accounted for approximately 34% of the non-retail B&M category globally in 2016. The unbranded artisanal and industrial channels, which together represented approximately 65% of the total non-retail category globally in 2016, provide a significant and under-explored opportunity.

In recent years, consumers have become increasingly conscious of what they eat, conditions such as gluten and dairy intolerance have become more widely recognized and more people are following “flexitarian”, vegetarian and vegan diets. There is an increasingly strong awareness of the benefits of plant-based diets, which FFG is well placed to exploit. Leveraging its product expertise, research and development capability and manufacturing capacity to further expand into plant-based products and adjacent categories is a key component of FFG’s strategy. FFG plans to build on the “free-from” diet and health trend by extending its strongest brands into dairy-free milk and yogurt alternatives. Further expansion into alternative and sweet spread adjacencies (including chocolate spreads), as well as plant-based dips, to appeal to higher income and health-conscious millennial demographics, also forms a central part of FFG’s strategy and is supported by underlying consumer consciousness of the benefits of a plant-based diet. FFG also intends to accelerate the DCA offering, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, emphasizing the advantages of these products over traditional dairy cream, including longer shelf life, lower cost of production, resistance to curdling, greater stability in whipping, the potential to be allergen free, as well as other health benefits. In addition to the expansion of FFG’s current ranges, there are opportunities in high fat variants, ambient products and vegan products. Target countries for adjacencies are large, growing and profitable with an easy-to-penetrate competitive landscape and positive consumer and retailer trends. A good example is non-dairy milk, which has been growing at around 11% per annum between 2014 and 2017 and is expected to continue growing at a strong pace due to underlying positive demand dynamics (consumers increasingly viewing non-dairy as a more “mainstream” proposition). Chilled dips and other adjacent categories have demonstrated similar strong growth potential. Due to its research and development capabilities, FFG is well positioned to take advantage of consumer appetite for alternative products in the packaged food and non-dairy space. 11 ----- To tap into the adjacencies segments, FFG will both leverage its existing brand portfolio and develop new brands. For example, Flora Pro Activ is already seen as a functional health-focused brand, which offers significant brand expansion opportunities—the brand is already present in the Netherlands in the non-dairy yogurt adjacent category, hence this provides a platform for growth. Other brands such as Brummel and Brown are active in products based on dairy yogurt, hence expanding into non-dairy yogurts, creams and drinks would also be achievable.

Emerging markets are a core part of FFG’s strategy, where FFG is able to leverage its strong brand and superior technology to offer high value, healthy and nutritious products to families around the world. In addition, FFG is the only manufacturer offering high levels of nutritious fats, including a margarine product containing Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids that is stable in tropical ambient conditions. The growth in opportunity in emerging market countries is supported by the favorable macroeconomic trends of strong population growth and rising real household incomes. There is also a notable opportunity to drive consumption among consumers in these countries, with the average consumption of B&M products per capita in FFG’s emerging markets being approximately one sixth of consumers in developed markets. Demand drivers in emerging markets are fundamentally different than in developed markets, with breakfast and baking occasions, especially during the holiday periods, the primary consumption occasions in the emerging markets. Bread consumption is also increasing in selected FFG emerging markets, which typically has a positive impact on the demand for B&M products. This trend offers an opportunity for FFG to drive further penetration and create new consumption occasions to drive volumes. Further, price elasticity is higher in emerging markets than in developed markets, which further incentivizes consumers to choose margarine as an alternative to butter given its lower price. Importantly, consumer perception of margarine in emerging markets is also fundamentally different: customers typically see margarine as an aspirational product with strong taste and health attributes. In particular, Blue Band, the leading FFG brand across emerging markets, is seen as an aspirational product by consumers when compared to traditional cooking oils or private label spreads products. This gives an incentive for consumers to “trade up” to FFG products on the back of higher purchasing power due to strengthening macroeconomic conditions.

Management is focused on growing FFG’s share and penetration in key emerging markets countries, which will be facilitated through operation as a standalone business. _Focus on key health benefits in less-developed emerging markets countries_ Management intends to capitalize on the current perception of margarine in emerging markets as a healthy, aspirational product by leveraging local partnerships with public stakeholders. Notably, FFG 8 ----- recently launched a “Good Breakfast” program in partnership with governments in several African countries to encourage healthy eating initiatives, which has reached millions of Africans to date. Management believes that FFG can reproduce the same approach in other emerging markets countries going forward to encourage healthy eating and additional use occasions for FFG’s natural product range. _Drive distribution_ There are a number of opportunities related to distribution strategies in emerging markets that FFG can pursue in order to improve the effectiveness of its operations and allow for faster growth. As an independent organization, FFG will be able to establish new relationships and enter underpenetrated countries where management sees significant opportunities. FFG believes it will be able to drive distribution in this way at limited incremental cost, given the current average unconstrained utilization rate (49% in the year ended December 30, 2016) across its facilities, which will allow for significant scope to grow volumes.

The Offer Letter cannot be withdrawn by Bidco and remains open for acceptance until the earlier of: (i) five business days after completion of certain works council consultation processes; and (ii) June 15, 2018, which is the estimated date for completion of these works council consultations (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). The Offer Letter may be extended by written agreement of the parties thereto for up to three additional months to provide extra time to complete the works council consultation processes. Once the offer has been accepted by Unilever, the parties will then execute the Acquisition Agreement. The Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. Depending on the timing of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to closing (including regulatory approvals and works council approvals), we expect to complete the Acquisition in the third quarter of 2018. The terms of the Acquisition Agreement do not provide for completion of the Acquisition any earlier than July 2, 2018. The total Acquisition consideration, including the purchase price paid for the Acquisition as well as certain related costs, fees and expenses, will be financed on the Completion Date using: - the Shareholder Contribution, in an amount of €1,974 million; - borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities, in an aggregate principal amount of €3,954 million (or its currency equivalent); - the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes.

We do not currently have a precise figure for this payment, but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This payment arises because we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever (i) receivables associated with sales of FFG’s products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) payables associated with raw materials received by FFG prior to the Completion Date, and have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing the average net negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and finished products conveyed with the business on the Completion Date. These arrangements are subject to change prior to the Completion Date.

These products are typically made by emulsifying a combination of buttermilk and vegetable oils, although dairy-free and vegan formulas are available as well. Dairy cream alternatives have a number of advantages over traditional dairy cream, including longer shelf life, lower cost of production, resistance to curdling, greater stability in whipping, the potential to be allergen free, as well as other health benefits. FFG’s DCA portfolio includes cooking creams, whipping creams, sour creams and spreads. These products are made from both vegetable fats and buttermilk, which have cost and health advantages over traditional dairy creams. DCA products are packaged in a variety of formats including pots, bottles, pouches and tetra packs for both the retail and foodservice channels. In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s turnover attributable to DCA products was €189.9 million, amounting to 7% of FFG’s total turnover during 2017. In the year ended December 31, 2017, Developed and Emerging markets accounted for 97% and 3%, respectively, of FFG’s turnover attributable to DCA products.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s operations in Developed Markets accounted for €2,302 million in turnover, representing 79% of FFG’s total turnover. Of FFG’s turnover attributable to Developed Markets during 2017, the United States accounted for 20%, Germany accounted for 13%, the United Kingdom accounted for 9%, the Netherlands accounted for 8% and Canada accounted for 5%. 125 ----- _Retail_ FFG’s retail operations in Developed Markets accounted for €2,004 million in turnover, representing 87% of FFG’s turnover attributable to Developed Markets and 69% of its total turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017. These operations are underpinned by FFG’s strong brand portfolio and longstanding relationships with leading retailers across its Developed Markets. FFG is the market leader in retail spreads sales volume in 22 of the 28 Developed Markets in which it operates, including the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Canada (based on FFG data and data for retail market volumes of margarine sourced from Euromonitor International and Nielsen). Those five countries together accounted for 62% of FFG’s turnover from retail Plant-Based Spreads sales in all Developed Markets in the year ended December 31, 2017. These leading positions in key Developed Markets are supported by FFG’s high degrees of brand awareness and strong relationships with large and well-known retailers. At various points in time in 2016 and 2017, Country Crock, Rama, Flora and Blue Band scored the highest among B&M brands in the United States, Germany, United Kingdom and Netherlands, respectively, according to Millward Brown. In addition, FFG distributes its products directly to some of the world’s largest retailers, including Walmart, Lidl, Rewe, Tesco, Kroger, Carrefour, Jumbo, Superunie, Ahold and Edeka, which FFG believes strengthens its brand awareness and market positioning. The top ten retailers of FFG products in developed markets account for 46% of all of FFG’s retail sales, with most of these relationships spanning over a decade. Even before the separation, FFG has been strategically repositioning its brands. This is shown in the evolution of the Becel Spreading brand in the Netherlands. In the first quarter of 2017, Becel Spreading was re-launched in the Netherlands market to emphasize its plant-based origins. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, Becel Spreading in the Netherlands had a USG decline of -1.7% compared to the prior twelve months. Following the relaunch, in the six months ended September 30, 2017, Becel Spreading in the Netherlands had a USG increase of 1.4%, compared to the same period in the prior year. Similarly, new initiatives have recently been launched which have enhanced taste and emphasized the plant-based nature of the Rama brand in Germany and the Country Crock brand in the U.S, and both brands have subsequently had improved USG. In the three months ended December 31, 2016, Rama’s USG declined by -15.7%. In the three months ended June 30, 2017, the USG decline of Rama in Germany had slowed to -5.2%, and by the three months ended December 31, 2017, USG increased by 13.0% compared to the same period in the prior year. For Country Crock in the U.S., in the three months ended December 31, 2016, USG declined by -7.9%. In the three months ended June 30, 2017, the USG decline of Country Crock had slowed to -3.2%, and by the three months ended December 31, 2017, USG declined slowed still further to -2.3% compared to the same period in the prior year. After the separation from Unilever, FFG will provide a dedicated sales force post-distribution and operate as the supplier of choice and/or “category captain” for certain strategic retailers, providing in-depth knowledge and consumer insight for particular product categories to its retailer customers. As is typical in the food industry, FFG does not have long-term contractual commitments with its key customers. Instead, FFG enters into bespoke joint business plans with customers, which are typically renewed on an annual basis, and cover prices charged by FFG to its customers, discounts and other investments. In some markets the level of investment is included in these joint business plans while in other countries promotions are more flexible and vary during the year. Consequently, FFG generally does not have fixed-duration, long-term contracts with its retailers, instead taking a flexible approach to product distribution that harnesses its research and development capabilities and is responsive to specific retailer needs and other market opportunities. FFG has also developed relationships with various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco and Carrefour online, which have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe represent a significant growth opportunity in the developed markets in which we operate. Although end consumers of FFG products in developed markets generally comprise families and higher income individuals from the “Generation X” and “Millennial” demographics, who tend to be more health-conscious in their dietary choices, FFG’s offering spans the entire price spectrum from value to premium. In its main markets, FFG maintains brands with distinct value propositions spanning family nutrition, heart health, cholesterol improving, superior taste, cooking & baking, and value champion. A key element of our strategy going forward is to expand upon and strengthen our coverage of the price spectrum and enhance our appeal to distinct niches and functional needs in each market in which we operate by repositioning existing brands, and launching new offerings, as needed. 126 ----- _Foodservice_ In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s foodservice operations in Developed Markets accounted for €298.4 million in turnover, representing 12% of FFG’s turnover attributable to Developed Markets and 10% of its total turnover. In 2017, FFG’s foodservice operations had a turnover of greater than €1 million in 23 Developed Markets and a small but growing market share in the social and commercial foodservice segment. FFG’s current foodservice customers include Aramark, Sodexo and Hilton. We believe that we can build on our current foodservice capabilities, including by expanding into the artisanal and industrial foodservice segments, due to the steady growth in out-of-home dining in recent years and the demonstrable advantages of Plant-Based Spreads products over butter in large-scale cooking and baking.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG brands hold the number one position in seven of its Latin American markets and 11 of its markets in Africa and the Middle East. End consumers of FFG’s products in emerging markets typically comprise middle class families. There is considerable upside potential in Emerging Markets arising from per capita levels of consumption, which are considerably lower than in Developed Markets, as well as household penetration of B&M products, which in some Emerging Markets is considerably lower than in Developed Markets. There is also opportunity in expanding into countries in which FFG does not currently operate. _Foodservice_ FFG’s foodservice operations in Emerging Markets accounted for €70 million in turnover, representing 12% of FFG’s turnover attributable to Emerging Markets and 2% of its total turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2017, FFG’s foodservice operations had a turnover of greater than €1 million in nine Emerging Markets.

FFG’s advertising function works with global and local media agencies, such as Mindshare, Initiative and Omnicom, to execute its media strategy through local specialists at the country or business unit level. The purchase and management of media at the local level enables FFG’s advertising to accommodate to each of the various markets in which it operates.

See “Industry.” FFG’s Plant-Based Spreads also face competition from alternative products such as butter, cooking oils, cream cheese and sweet spreads. Principal competitors to FFG’s DCA products are traditional dairy creams. The competitive dynamics in FFG’s industry are also driven by changes in dietary and taste trends. In particular, the decline in consumption of bread in developed markets over the past decade has presented a competitive challenge for FFG and others in its industry.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG’s research and development platform has eight principal capabilities: - Chefmanship—The research and development platform incorporates insight into real world cooking practices with ongoing feedback from food professionals to remain on culinary trend and provide optimal taste and functionality for each market, with these metrics being continually reviewed and improved upon. - Consumer technical insight—The research and development platform seeks to translate consumer expectations into technical requirements, enabling product and packaging design to be optimized. This includes capitalizing on FFG’s in-house, world-leading flavor development resource, in depth know-how of melting behavior and flavor release and advanced flavor mapping in key markets to give insights to maximize market share. For example, we are developing the only spreads product with Omega 3 and 6 to be stable in tropical conditions. - Digital—The research and development platform uses digital tools to capture ingredient and process knowledge, supporting the delivery of product development through precision modelling. The ready access to these resources via FFG’s digital tools gives it the ability to launch new on-trend products within three to six months. Digital modelling also supports cost efficient product development, with functions like the ability to digitally predict structure and melting of recipes allowing new product innovation to be accelerated with minimal associated costs. - Nutrition—The strength of FFG’s brands is supported by its ability to translate nutrition science into product claims, communications and endorsements. Its portfolio of cholesterol lowering spreads have been at the forefront of the development of products with demonstrable health benefits that do not compromise on taste. - Flavors—Taste is the primary criterion that drives the purchase of FFG’s products. Its research and development platform has invested heavily in developing proprietary flavors that enhance consumer experience and allow FFG’s products to achieve parity with butter. - Packaging development—In addition to the products themselves, the design of attractive and robust packaging that is easy to produce and convenient to transport and use contributes to the success of FFG’s business. - Regulatory—Food safety is a paramount issue in FFG’s business. A key part of the research and development function is ensuring that FFG’s products are fully compliant with local requirements. This is accomplished through strong and ongoing engagement with governments, regulators and other opinion formers with impact on diet and health guidelines. - Technological capabilities—FFG’s pioneering technologies, many of which are proprietary, together with deep institutional knowledge of the production process have made it a leader in the industry. For example, FFG’s fast blending process is a new simpler and safer production process capable of delivering a wide range of products for both emerging and developed markets. It can be implemented in a modular production set up requiring lower capital expenditure than traditional production methods and enabling fast capacity expansion for 128 ----- emerging markets. FFG has over 75 patents for industry-leading manufacturing processes and other proprietary technology. These capabilities will be supported by strategically located facilities worldwide.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,2686,U.K.,2686.17,Procurement,2686.17.1,,"The primary raw materials used in the production of FFG’s products are commodities, primarily comprising liquid oils and tropical oils, such as rapeseed, soybean, palm and sunflower oil, as well as blended oils, water and cardboard and plastic packaging materials. With the exception of palm oil, FFG sources most of its food ingredients and packaging materials directly from local suppliers, and its supply chain is aligned with its geographic footprint, enabling it to optimize its supply arrangements and minimise distribution costs. FFG operates a centralized procurement function designed to leverage its purchasing expertise and maximize scale efficiencies across both developed and emerging markets. FFG’s procurement function has a deep understanding of commodity cycles and risk management, and many years of experience in the oils market. To optimize pricing, FFG uses its blend flex process to identify and purchase the cheapest oil blends on the market based on dynamic price analysis in order to manufacture its products to consistent standards of taste and quality. FFG’s risk management mechanisms include the use of physical stocks, contracts, derivatives and other financial hedging transactions to insulate the business from short term price volatility across a majority of its input commodities, with initiatives underway to expand the scope of such measures to cover packaging material costs as well. Because many commodity prices worldwide are set in U.S. dollars, while FFG’s turnover is generated in the local currencies in the markets in which it operates, a layered hedging approach of up to 12 months duration is used to hedge this foreign currency transaction exposure. FFG has developed strong, long-standing relationships with its major suppliers of key raw materials, many of which have been in place for over a decade. FFG also benefits from favorable payment terms with a large number of suppliers enabling advantageous working capital management. To some extent, these favorable payment terms may be attributable to the supplier finance program sponsored by Unilever, which allows suppliers to factor their FFG receivables at selected banks at rates these suppliers find attractive and serves as an inducement to make payment terms more favorable than they otherwise would be. In the event this program ends after the separation from Unilever, our payment terms with participating suppliers may become less favorable; however, management believes that the standard market terms to which such suppliers might revert in the commodity markets in which FFG purchases its key inputs are more than sufficient to allow FFG to maintain a strong structural net negative working capital position. Key suppliers of commodities include ArcherDanielsMidland, Wilmar, C Thywissen, Bunge, Sime Darby, Cargill and Olenex. Key suppliers of packaging include Amcor, RPC and Smurfit Kappa. In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG spent €812.3 million on raw materials and €281.7 million on packaging materials, representing 45% and 15%, respectively, of FFG’s total supply chain costs.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Unilever intends to robustly defend this claim and believe that the likelihood that it will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. Any liability resulting from this claim would be the responsibility of Unilver, and Unilever have given an indemnity to Bidco for any fines resulting from historic claims. Unilever believes its position is strong and so the matter has not been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Additionally, in March 2018, a Unilever subsidiary in Greece received a Statement of Objections from the Hellenic Competition Commission for alleged violations of competition law in the margarine sector from 1996 until today.

Should the allegations be upheld, the maximum fine which could be levied would be 131 ----- approximately €40 million. Unilever intends to defend these allegations robustly, although there is no guarantee of success, and therefore the matter has not been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Finally, in 2015 a class action lawsuit was filed against one of Unilever’s subsidiaries in California based on allegations of deceptive labelling and marketing of the “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!” brand. The case had been stayed since 2015 pending rulings in another appellate matter, but the stay was lifted in 2017 and class certification discovery is now ongoing. A decision on class certification is expected in 2019. Unilever intends to robustly defend this claim and has not reserved any amounts in connection with this litigation.

We intend to use the gross proceeds of the Offering, together with the borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Shareholder Contribution, to (i) finance the Acquisition and (ii) pay costs, expenses and fees in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.” Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Deposit Accounts, which are segregated and controlled by the Issuer to hold such amounts pending the consummation of the Acquisition.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Offering— If the Deposit Release Conditions are not satisfied, the Issuer will be _required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn, and the Revolving Credit Facility may only be drawn after a drawdown of the Senior Term Facilities has occurred. On or about the Completion Date, we expect to draw an amount under the Revolving Credit Facility for a working capital reimbursement to Unilever. We do not currently have a figure for this payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is subject to change prior to the Completion Date.

Some of_ these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements. Our presentation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA has additional limitations as an analytical tool. For example, pro forma Normalized EBITDA does not reflect expenses and capital expenditures that FFG expects to incur to transition to a stand-alone business, which we currently estimate will be approximately €200 million in transition-related expenses and one time expenditures, including approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs that we expect FFG to incur as it transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform, and approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as certain manufacturing and management functions are separated from Unilever and relocated (before any offsetting gains from land sales are considered). The substantial majority of these expenses are expected to be incurred over an extended period, up to an including the year ending December 31, 2019. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures.” (2) The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Underlying free cash flow to Cash flow from operating activities for the periods indicated.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Accordingly. Portuguese joint venture adjustment (i) adds back the share of net profit of Portuguese joint venture included in FFG’s Net profit (2015: €3.3 million, 2016: €3.3 million, 2017: €3.7 million), which item is deducted when reconciling Cash flow from operating 27 ----- activities to Net profit, (ii) adds in the share of net profit of Portuguese joint venture attributed to the non-Unilever-owned portion of that business (2015: €2.7 million, 2016: €2.7 million, 2017: €3.0 million) which will be acquired by FFG in connection with the Transactions, and (iii) adds in the entire net finance costs, taxation, depreciation and amortization of that business (2015: €2.0 million, 2016: €2.1 million, 2017: €2.5 million). (b) Exceptional bonus and share-based payment adjustment arises because, in part due to the Acquisition, Unilever’s spreads business paid incentive and share-based compensation to its employees at rates materially higher than the rates used in other areas of Unilever’s business in the year ended December 31, 2017, which were also higher than the rates used across Unilever’s global business in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. The adjustment amount reflects the portion of the bonus and share-based payments attributable to the amount by which the rate used in the spreads business exceeded the average rate used across the rest of Unilever’s businesses in the year ended December 31, 2017. (3) Underlying free cash conversion ratio for any period represents Underlying free cash flow for that period divided by Normalized EBITDA for that period, expressed as a percentage.

The adjustment amount reflects the portion of the bonus and share-based payments attributable to the amount by which the rate used in the spreads business exceeded the average rate used across the rest of Unilever’s businesses in the year ended December 31, 2017. f) Non-underlying items are comprised of restructuring costs in each period presented. These restructuring costs principally relate to costs directly incurred within FFG’s business, but also include an amount of €1.6 million allocated from Unilever in 2017 (2016: €4.5 million, 2015: €9.2 million), Restructuring costs incurred in 2015 include €49.8 million arising from the consolidation of multiple U.S. factories into one facility at New Century, Kansas. In 2015, an additional €13.4 million was incurred in relation to Project Eagle, the set up of the separate BCS structure. In 2016, €14 million of costs were incurred completing Project Eagle and restructuring of Global Spreads Marketing and R&D teams. Non-underlying items in Developed Markets (both direct and allocated) were -€83.6 million, -€21.3 million and €1.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Non-underlying items in Emerging Markets (both direct and allocated) were -€5.6 million, -€7.3 million and -€7.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 g) In connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint venture entity (Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG. Accordingly, the Portuguese Joint Venture adjustment adds in (i) the share of net profit of Portuguese joint venture attributed to the non-Unilever-owned portion of that business (2015: €2.7 million, 2016: €2.7 million, 2017: €3.0 million) and (ii) the entire net finance costs, taxation, depreciation and amortization of that business (2015: €3.7 million, 2016: €3.9 million, 2017: €4.5 million). The Portugal joint venture adjustment relates entirely to operations in Developed Markets. h) Finance costs related to pensions and similar obligations for Developed Markets were €nil for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Finance costs for related to pensions and similar obligations for Emerging Markets were €0.2 million, €0.1 million and €0.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. 29 ----- i) Carve-out adjustments from day one are analysed as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

These allocated costs, amounting to €293 million (Developed Markets: €220 million (after deducting €22 million of the exceptional bonus and share-based payments attributable to overheads), Emerging Markets: €73 million), included costs with respect to customer development, marketing support, research and development, finance, IT, HR, general management, workplace services, legal, share-based payments, and other overhead costs. We estimate that FFG would have incurred approximately €215 million in SG&A overhead expenses (Developed Markets: €177 million, Emerging Markets: €37 million) had it fully transitioned to providing such services internally or contracted with third-party services providers and ceased using services provided by Unilever. This includes a reduction of €64 million in overall costs, plus the shifting of approximately €14 million of internal overhead costs (primarily in customer development and marketing support costs) to trade terms with distributors, which we expect to occur in connection with the increased utilization of third-party distributors discussed below in note (iv). Net allocated costs for SG&A overheads provided by Unilever in the year ended December 31, 2017, also included non-underlying restructuring costs of €5.9 million discussed above at note f which are not included in our standalone cost base given their expected non-recurring nature. Management’s estimated annual stand-alone SG&A overhead expenses consist of the following estimated amounts: - €59.3 million in customer development costs, related to sales personnel to manage customer relationships, sales agency fees in markets where certain customer relationship functions are or will be outsourced, and sales support costs, such as car lease expenses. - €30.0 million in marketing support costs, related to the global and local coordination of communications, advertising, brand strategy and lobbying. - €30.2 million in research and development costs, related to the development of manufacturing techniques, the formulation of new products which can be produced with existing manufacturing techniques, adapting and testing products in local markets before release, and the monitoring and implementation of food standards and safety guidelines. - €26.9 million in finance department costs, related to functions such as financial reporting and budgeting, performance monitoring, tax strategy and compliance, risk management, insurance, contract management, supply chain finance management, treasury services, cash management and working capital management. - €23.7 million in IT costs, related to the main business processes (apart from supply chain IT costs, which are accounted for in supply chain costs). FFG’s current IT environment is fully shared with Unilever, which will only be available for a limited time after the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to a TSA. FFG has developed plans to transition to a fully independent IT environment as a stand-alone business; however, these plans are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—As FFG _builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, it may incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.”_ - €9.2 million in HR costs, related to central and local support of payroll and benefits systems, provision of training, as well as other traditional HR functions. - €8.3 million for workplace services, related to property management, facilities management and travel services, as well as rent, utility and other operating costs for office space. - €13.7 million across general management, legal and other corporate and local costs. - €13.3 million incentive costs for key management and directors. After the Completion Date, FFG will not incur any allocated expenses from Unilever. FFG has engaged several consultants and industry experts who have assisted it in the analysis of its anticipated stand-alone cost structure. During a transition period of up to 18 months following the Completion Date, FFG will continue to receive certain services from Unilever under the TSAs for which FFG will incur direct costs, as discussed under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” The TSAs also contain 6 month extension options for IT services and shared services which FFG may exercise. The stand-alone cost structure described in this note (i) is reflected in the pricing of such services under the TSAs. In addition, for up to three years after the consummation of the Acquisition, FFG and Unilever will be party to certain co-packing and reverse co-packing agreements, which stand apart from the TSAs. (ii) Supply chain adjustment relates primarily to management’s estimate of cost savings expected to be achieved from the replacement of overhead allocations from Unilever with bottom-up stand-alone costs, including (a) a raw material cost adjustment to remove central charges, (b) a distribution cost adjustment, (c) savings on local labor costs on a stand-alone basis, and (d) a production cost adjustment relating to network optimization plans and the replacement of allocated production overheads with stand-alone costs. Supply chain adjustments allocated to 30 ----- Developed Markets amount to €26.4 million in the aggregate, while those allocated to Emerging Markets amount to €7.1 million in the aggregate. (iii) Branding and Marketing Investment adjustment primarily relates to management’s estimate of cost savings expected to be achieved from (a) the elimination of €8 million of global marketing costs allocated by Unilever (such as those related to group-wide campaign costs and shared marketing activities) with respect to markets which will remain on a direct sales model and their replacement with brand and marketing investments planned on an FFG stand-alone basis and (b) an additional €9 million of estimated expected reductions in annual brand and marketing investment associated with the increased utilization of third-party distributors discussed below in note (iv). Branding and Marketing Investment adjustments allocated to Developed Markets amount to €9.8 million in the aggregate, while those allocated to Emerging Markets amount to €7.6 million in the aggregate. The Branding and Marketing Investment adjustment does not account for the one-time exceptional branding and marketing expenditures which FFG expects to make to re-position itself and its brands over an extended period after completion of the Acquisition, comprising an estimated €175 million of costs spread through the years up to December 31, 2021, which is incremental to the regular recurring branding and marketing investment of the business. See See “Summary—Strategy—Accelerate clearly defined initiatives to stabilize Developed Markets”. (iv) Distributor model adjustment comprises management’s estimate of the direct cost impact of an expected increase in the use of third-party distributers as a result of FFG’s separation from Unilever; management believes that the increase in the use of third-part distributors will have an overall neutral effect on Normalized EBITDA because of offsetting factors identified below. In several of our smaller markets (currently projected at 32) served through a direct sales model under Unilever, we expect FFG to transition to the use of third-party distributors following the separation from Unilever. This transition is expected to result in a €22 million annual increase in costs related to trade terms and concessions to third-party distributors, who are expected to provide certain logistical, branding and marketing support. In addition, we expect that certain markets which will remain predominantly on a direct sales model after the separation from Unilever (such as Hungary and Austria) will nevertheless experience a limited increase in the use of third-party distributors, creating an additional €4 million in annual costs. Across Developed Markets, the total annual costs are expected to amount to €9.6 million, while across Emerging Markets, the total annual costs are expected to amount to €16.6 million. The additional services to be provided by third-party distributors are, however, expected to allow FFG to (a) reduce branding and marketing investment in respect of those markets by €9 million annually, the impact of which is reflected in Branding and Marketing Investment adjustment and discussed above in note (iii), as well as (b) reduce overhead costs related to the existing internal provision of such services by €14 million annually, the impact of which is reflected in net savings on SG&A overheads and discussed above in note (i). Accordingly, the switch to a distributor model in these countries is expected to have an overall neutral effect on Normalized EBITDA. (v) Depreciation and amortisiation adjustment arises because net savings on SG&A overheads, described above in note (i), and supply chain adjustment, described above in note (ii), were each calculated with reference to allocated Unilever operating costs which included allocated depreciation and amortisation charges. For purposes of calculating a Normalized EBITDA metric, however, management believes that it is inappropriate to include depreciation and amortisation cost components. Accordingly, €15.3 million of depreciation and amortisation attributable to supply chain is backed-out, and €8.0 million of depreciation and amortisation attributable to overhead costs is backed-out. This entire adjustment is attributed to Developed Markets. j) Share-based payments adjustment reflects estimated cost savings from the planned elimination of share-based incentive costs for key management and directors which are at present included in the stand-alone operating model (described as incentive costs for key management and directors at note i) with the non-cash management incentive plan described under the caption “Management—Director and Executive Officer Compensation.” The share-based payments adjustment is allocated €10.5 million to Developed Markets and €2.8 million to Emerging Markets. k) Implemented 2017 savings initiatives reflects the full year effect of several projects that were implemented in 2017, including procurement projects across a range of inputs, such as raw materials and packaging (€26.2 million) and savings in supply chain through diverse initiatives such as negotiations with freight carriers, network and labor optimization, energy management and fat reduction initiatives in Europe (€1.8 million). Implemented 2017 savings initiatives in Developed Markets amount to €23.0 million in the aggregate, while those in Emerging Markets amount to €6.1 million in the aggregate. l) Completion Date SG&A cost savings represent additional operating cost and efficiency opportunities in SG&A, beyond the carve-out net savings on SG&A overheads discussed above in note i, which the Issuer believes can and will be promptly implemented upon the consummation of the Acquisition. These mainly represent cost avoidance via rightsizing of the support functions (including finance, IT, HR) and other general and administrative costs through increased concentration of activities in central or regional hubs. This adjustment also accounts for the opportunity to reduce selectively research and development costs (which management believes are higher than those of industry peers) by moving to a more centralized organization relative to the structure currently in place under Unilever. These savings will be achieved by hiring people only for the functions needed in the new streamlined organization. The Completion Date SG&A cost savings form a subset of management’s longer-term plans, developed in close consultation with KKR and leading industry consultants, to implement approximately €200 million of cost savings and efficiencies across raw materials and procurement, manufacturing, supply chain, marketing and SG&A after consummation of the Acquisition. The realization of some of these longer-term cost saving plans (but not the Completion Date SG&A cost savings) is expected to require the incurrence of approximately €45 million to €50 million of non-recurring restructuring and related costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by December 31, 2020). See “Summary—Strategy—Realize significant cost savings opportunity.” Completion Date SG&A cost savings in Developed Markets amount to €21.5 million in the aggregate, while those in Emerging Markets amount to €5.6 million in the aggregate. 31 ----- m) Impact of commodity prices is an add-back to reflect the impact of declining prices of edible commodity oils (including sunflower, rapeseed, palm and soybean based oils) between the first and second halves of 2017 and management’s expectation that the prices of such commodities during the second half of 2017 are more representative for the business on a go forward basis. The identified savings reflects the incremental Normalized EBITDA that would have been generated during the period if the average prices of such commodities during all of 2017 were the same as the average prices during the second half of 2017. These commodity prices trended downward during the second half of 2017, as well as over the last three years, and management expects them to continue to trade at similar levels for the foreseeable future. Impact of commodity prices in Developed Markets amounts to €5.5 million, while in Emerging Markets it amounts to €1.5 million. n) Other adjustments are analysed as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,2680,SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION,2680.27,Other adjustments** **(5.8),2680.27.1,,"(i) Phasing adjustment to implemented 2017 savings initiatives reflects the fact that €1.1 million of the savings initiatives described in note k had limited evidence of full implementation in 2017. This entire adjustment is attributed to Emerging Markets. (ii) Supply chain depreciation adjustment reflects an add-back of €5.9 million of depreciation costs attributable principally to packaging molds in the U.S. which are recorded within supply chain costs. This entire adjustment is attributed to Developed Markets. (iii) Pensions adjustment reflects estimated additional costs of providing pension benefits to employees not included in the stand-alone operating SG&A model discussed above at note i. The pensions adjustment is allocated €2.8 million to Developed Markets and €0.7 million to Emerging Markets. (iv) Additional overhead savings consists of additional savings on R&D employee and central costs which management believes can be promptly achieved after the Completion Date which are not otherwise reflected in pro forma Normalized EBITDA. Additional overhead savings are allocated €6.5 million to Developed Markets and €1.7 million to Emerging Markets. (v) Stand-alone insurance adjustment reflects estimated additional insurance expected to be incurred after the separation from Unilever that are not included in the stand-alone operating model described above in note (i). The stand-alone insurance adjustment is allocated €3.3 million to Developed Markets and €0.9 million to Emerging Markets. (vi) Dis-synergies adjustment reflects additional costs associated with the loss of scale and bargaining power that will be caused by the separation from Unilever, including with respect to branding and marketing costs (€4.6 million) and supply chain costs (€3.3 million) The dis-synergies adjustment is allocated €6.3 million to Developed Markets and €1.6 million to Emerging Markets. (vii) Wage inflation adjustment reflects the application of a blended inflation rate of 1.9% to the costs set forth in the stand-alone operating SG&A model described above in note (i), which is applied due to the fact that the model was developed using 2016 cost data. The wage inflation adjustment is allocated €3.4 million to Developed Markets and €0.9 million to Emerging Markets. (viii) Legacy credit facility cost adjustment reflects commitment fees in respect of a revolving credit facility that will no longer exist in the business after the consummation of the Transactions. The legacy credit facility cost adjustment is allocated €0.9 million to Developed Markets and €0.2 million to Emerging Markets. o) Our presentation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA has additional limitations as an analytical tool. For example, pro _forma Normalized EBITDA does not reflect expenses and capital expenditures that FFG expects to incur to transition to_ a stand-alone business, which we currently estimate will be approximately €200 million in transition-related expenses and one time expenditures, including approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs that we expect FFG to incur as it transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform, and approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as certain manufacturing and management functions are separated from Unilever and relocated (before any offsetting gains from land sales are considered). The substantial majority of these expenses are expected to be incurred over an extended period, up to an including the year ending December 31, 2019. (5) Normalized EBITDA margin for any given region represents Normalized EBITDA for that region divided by turnover for that region, expressed as a percentage. (6) Pro forma Normalized EBITDA margin for any given region represents pro forma Normalized EBITDA for that region divided by turnover for that region after deducting the Distributor model adjustment applicable for that region (see note i to footnote 4, above), expressed as a percentage.

The financial data has been derived from the audited combined carve-out Financial Statements of FFG for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” The combined carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared by combining and carving-out the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that management have determined relate to Unilever’s spreads business. Those amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the Unilever entities running spreads activities, which also include allocations and recharges by Unilever of indirect central costs and general corporate expenses. The combined carve-out Financial Statements include a cash flow statement showing movement arising from operating, investing and financing activities irrespective of Unilever’s centralized approach to cash management and financing and disclose the cumulative investment of Unilever in the spreads business as net parent (deficit) / investment. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to Unilever’s spreads business include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the spreads business, together with an allocation of the items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out Financial Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. The Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect Unilever’s spreads business financial position, results of operations or cash flows had the spreads business been a separate entity, or the future results of the spreads business as it will exist upon the completion of the separation from Unilever. See “Presentation of Financials and Other Information.” This summary historical combined-consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the combined carve-out Financial Statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG has no operating history as an independent company and certain essential business functions are currently and will, pursuant to a number of TSAs, continue to be carried out centrally by Unilever, including IT services, marketing, distribution, shared finance function, human resources, workplace and travel services and logistics. The terms of the TSAs range from six to 18 months, with early termination rights on a regional basis with advance written notice. The TSAs are an essential part of the implementation of our strategy, allowing us to construct business infrastructure that is appropriate to FFG’s needs as a stand-alone business without disrupting its operations during the separation process. The services provided pursuant to the TSAs are bespoke and, in some cases, interdependent, making the transition away from the TSAs to stand-alone operations particularly complex. After the TSAs expire, we may not be able to replace these services at all, or to obtain these services at prices or on terms as favorable as the TSAs provide. If the services covered by the TSAs are not provided as anticipated or if we are unable to successfully implement plans to migrate from the TSAs to stand-alone business functions, on the timescale anticipated and on the costs projected, or at all, such developments could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to recruit or retain sufficient staff when needed to deliver these standalone business functions could cause this risk to materialize. Any failure or significant disruption to the delivery of Unilever’s services during the transitional period could impact the ability to produce and deliver products, or prevent us from paying suppliers and employees, executing foreign currency transactions or performing other administrative services on a timely basis, or could result in weaknesses and deficiencies in its internal controls. Any such development could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect what its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had FFG operated as a separate, stand-alone company or reporting segment during the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum and, in particular, the Financial Statements do not reflect the implementation of the separation blueprint or management’s target operating model, which differs in substantial respects from the manner in which the business has been operated under Unilever. Unilever did not account for FFG, and FFG did not operate, as a separate, stand-alone company for the periods presented. The historical costs and expenses reflected in FFG’s Financial Statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Unilever, including legal, finance, human resources and other administrative functions. These allocations are based on what FFG and Unilever consider to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these functions required in support of FFG’s business; however, we believe the costs of these functions on a stand-alone basis will differ substantially from costs allocated historically. 34 ----- Moreover, the Financial Statements do not reflect the costs of borrowing funds as a separate entity. The balance sheet information in the Financial Statements presented in this Offering Memorandum was derived from Unilever’s centralized financial information. It includes items that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to FFG’s business together with an allocation of relevant balances from Unilever to FFG for those items that were not directly attributable or separately identifiable. A number of estimates, judgements and assumptions were made for the purpose of allocating those items that were not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Statements”. The balance sheet of the standalone business once the separation from Unilever is complete will differ substantially from the historic allocated balance sheet in many specific areas, including working capital, debt, equity, intangible assets amongst others.

The adjustments made to arrive at the pro forma and adjusted financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum reflect, among other things, changes in FFG’s funding, operational model and overheads that are expected to result from its separation from Unilever.

We calculate pro forma Normalized EBITDA by adjusting FFG’s Normalized EBITDA to: - remove allocated supply chain and general overhead expenses that are associated with services that we have historically received from Unilever, while adding back stand-alone costs that we estimate would have been incurred by FFG by it providing such services internally or by contracting with third parties, assuming FFG had already fully transitioned to a stand-alone entity, which we estimate will require €200 million of transition-related expenses and one-time expenditures, the substantial majority of which will be incurred by December 31, 2019; - reflect the full year run-rate effect of certain procurement savings, expected changes in commodity prices and synergy initiatives recently undertaken by FFG in anticipation of its separation; - reflect certain changes to FFG’s cost structure that are expected to result from the increased use of third-party distributors after FFG’s separation from Unilever, including the transition of 32 markets from a direct distribution model to a third-party distributor model and the increased use of third-party distributors in other markets; and - reflect certain branding and marketing cost savings that are expected to be implemented as part of the separation from Unilever. In anticipation of becoming a stand-alone entity, we have entered into negotiations with third-party service providers. We have also engaged several consultants and industry experts to assist us in the analysis of our anticipated cost structure. Our estimates are based on these expected contracts, meetings and discussions, the advice of such industry experts and consultants, benchmarking against other companies within our industry and the industry experience of our management team. The expenses that we estimate we will incur through our internal operations and with third-party service providers are based on several assumptions, including assumptions regarding the volumes of services we will require from such third-party service providers, the price at which such services will be offered, the number of employees we will require to operate as a stand-alone entity and the salaries and benefits we will be required to pay such employees. We cannot assure you that these assumptions will prove to be accurate. Given these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that the performance improvements reflected in pro forma Normalized EBITDA will be reached. Some of our estimates of volumes are based on volumes that are implied from Unilever’s historical allocations of expenses to our business, which may not be accurate or fairly predict future costs and/or 35 ----- volumes. Where we anticipate entering into an agreement with a third-party service provider, but do not yet have an executed contract, we based our assumptions on both the price at which we expect such services will be provided, as well as the volumes of services that we expect we will require. We cannot assure you that our assumptions regarding such expenses will prove to be accurate. In calculating pro forma Normalized EBITDA, we also assumed that, after the expiration of the transition period, we will no longer receive services from Unilever under the TSAs.

Following FFG’s separation from Unilever pursuant to the Transactions, we will be a smaller and less diversified company than Unilever, and will not have access to financial and other resources comparable to those of Unilever prior to the separation. In most markets, large media companies give large discounts based on the amounts of media purchased. FFG, as part of Unilever, has benefitted from Unilever discounts for both traditional and digital media. As a standalone entity FFG will try to negotiate favorable rates and will consider entering media buying groups where possible, but there is no guarantee that FFG will be successful. Even if FFG is successful, there will still likely be some increase in costs versus historic rates.

Some customers may take advantage of the fact that we are a smaller, more narrowly focused business to induce us to offer them additional discounts or other investments. Additionally, following the separation, we will not be able to rely on Unilever’s diversification, earnings, assets, cash flow or credit, and will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital and servicing our own debt.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever,13.1.6,"Following the separation, we will experience a temporary increase in our working capital needs.","Historically, FFG has maintained a net negative working capital position by managing its trade payables on terms of up to 120 days, while managing its receivables on typically terms of 30 days or less, in each case consistent with the markets for raw materials and finished products in which FFG operates. In connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever (i) receivables associated with sales of FFG’s products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) payables associated with raw materials received by FFG prior to the Completion Date. We have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing the average net negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and finished products conveyed with the business on the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily our net negative working capital position. While the foregoing amounts cannot be known with precision as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to change prior to the Completion Date, we estimate that the aggregate 36 ----- amount we will pay to Unilever on account of the the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position will be in the range of €350 million to €450 million and that this amount will be paid on or about the Completion Date. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to make this payment. While we expect our net working capital position to return to a net negative position and largely normalize within 120 days after such payment is made (and we expect to repay the Revolving Credit Facility drawing as our working capital position normalizes), there can be no guarantee that all of these transaction will occur as and when expected and that our net working capital position will in fact normalize on that schedule, or at all. Changes to trade terms available to us after the separation (discussed further under the caption “—Changes to FFG’s payment terms with customers or suppliers _may adversely affect is working capital position and operating cash flows”) as well as fluctuations in the_ underlying market prices or sales volumes for our products or the raw materials we consume, could each delay or prevent the expected normalization of our net working capital position; moreover, technical difficulties in valuing inventories and reconciling accounts may delay the date of the payment in respect of the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Many large FFG suppliers, especially raw and packaging material suppliers in the developed world, have been able to utilize supplier financing arrangements while FFG was a part of Unilever. As a standalone entity with a lower credit rating, it is unlikely that FFG will be able to offer supplier financing on such attractive terms, and hence some suppliers may renew efforts to reduce payment terms. At the same time, FFG may experience pressure from its customers to extend the number of days before paying its accounts receivable. Historically, FFG has benefitted from relatively short receivables days as compared to its payable days, allowing it to operate with negative net working capital. Any failure to continue to manage its accounts payable and accounts receivable in this manner, whether due to changes in market practices, a reduction in scale brought about by the separation from Unilever, the termination of any supplier finance arrangements historically sponsored by Unilever, or other reasons, may negatively affect FFG’s working capital position and cash flows, which would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The implementation of the separation blueprint is subject to execution risks and will require a significant amount of management’s time and effort, diverting attention from the business and other strategic priorities. Because FFG has not operated as a stand-alone company in the past, we may need to acquire assets, obtain business services and hire employees in addition to those transferred by Unilever in connection with the implementation of the separation blueprint. Moreover, as a smaller company with a different ownership structure than Unilever, we may have difficulty retaining employees who are transferred pursuant to the separation blueprint. We may face difficulty integrating newly acquired assets, newly contracted services and newly hired employees into the business. In particular, FFG has a large number of staffing vacancies relative to the positions that are expected to be required to be filled once the TSAs terminate and the separation is fully completed. If we and FFG are unable to retain, recruit, hire and train a sufficient number of qualified individuals to fill these vacancies, or if we or FFG are only able to do so at higher than expected cost due to competition or any other reason, our ability to successfully operate as a stand-alone business will be compromised. Moreover, as a result of the separation from Unilever, we expect to shift from a direct sales model to a third-party distributor model in 35 of FFG’s markets, while using Unilever’s distribution infrastructure under a TSA during the interim.

Moreover, even if consent is obtained and FFG succeeds to Unilever under the relevant joint venture, contract or license, the relevant counterparty may terminate the arrangement if it disagrees with the way we conduct business following the separation. If a substantial number of these contracts, joint ventures and licenses were terminated, we may be forced to enter into new contracts, joint ventures or licenses. Moreover, contracts to which FFG succeeds may not be long-term in nature and may require renegotiation on a regular basis. Some of these new counterparties may have stronger bargaining positions than when FFG’s existing contracts were originally negotiated.

While the TSAs are intended to provide transitional coverage, and while Unilever has agreed to transfer or license to us certain intellectual property that is within its power to transfer or license which has been used in the conduct of FFG’s business, following the separation we may no longer be a beneficiary under a number of Unilever’s existing agreements with third-parties. As a result, we may not have rights to use important intellectual property that FFG has previously been licensed to use and may therefore be subject to claims that FFG is infringing intellectual property rights of third parties through the manufacture and sale of its products and the operation of its business.

Its performance depends on the availability of accurate and timely data and other information from key software applications to aid day-to-day business and decision-making processes. FFG may be adversely affected if the controls designed to manage information technology operational risks fail to contain such risks. Prior to FFG’s separation from Unilever, FFG was fully integrated into Unilever’s IT environment. As part of the separation, FFG is migrating its data and business processes to its own stand-alone IT infrastructure, including critical business functions such as accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control, quality and compliance systems, customer service, inventory control and distribution. We expect that the IT migration process will take a substantial amount of time before and after the consummation of the Acquisition and require the incurrence of substantial one-time costs, which are currently estimated at approximately €165 million, including certain manufacturing and IT costs. There can be no assurance that this figure will not grow as the IT transition progresses. During a transitional period after the consummation of the Acquisition, we will have access to Unilever’s IT environment under a TSA. If this is not properly managed, we may incur temporary 38 ----- interruptions in business operations. However the biggest risk will occur when we transition from Unilever’s existing transactional and operational systems, data centers and shared services teams to independent systems, data centers and shared services. We may not be successful in implementing these new systems, they may cost more to run than expected and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Any unexpected operational interruptions as the new systems are implemented, or a failure to implement the new systems and replace Unilever’s services successfully, could disrupt the business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

It is unknown what impact this will have on consumer preference. In addition, Unilever’s corporate identity is widely recognized and respected by customers, suppliers, business partners and potential employees.

In particular, we may encounter challenges to business continuity while central functions are separated, manufacturing sites are being separated, loss of volumes during the change in distribution infrastructure in certain markets, and delays or overruns in the implementation of the IT landscape. In many respects, we will be dependent on Unilever to manage these risks and operate the FFG business on a transitional basis pursuant to the TSAs. However, there can be no assurance that the services provided under the TSAs will meet our requirements in a timely and effective manner. It is also possible that we may need to operate under the TSAs for longer than expected if it is not able to implement current plans to build the relevant stand-alone business functions in a timely manner, as it may be difficult for us to replace, or undertake on its own, the services provided under the TSAs, at reasonable costs or at all. A failure to implement FFG’s cost optimization and growth strategies, in whole or in part, including due to its inability to realize the anticipated benefits from its separation from Unilever and to successfully transition from its dependence on the TSAs with Unilever, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to FFG’s Business and Industry,13.3.1,FFG operates in a highly competitive market and its failure to compete effectively could adversely affect its results of operations.,"The markets for B&M products are highly competitive globally, particularly in developed markets, which accounts for the majority of FFG’s turnover. In developed markets, the margarine sector in particular has experienced a secular decline in recent years, which has heightened competitive pressures. FFG’s competitors include retailers who promote private label products and well-established branded producers that operate on both a national and an international basis across single or multiple dairy and non-dairy categories. FFG’s competitors generally compete with it on the basis of price, actual or perceived quality, health benefits and “naturalness” of products, brand recognition, consumer loyalty, product variety, new product development and improvements to existing products. FFG might not successfully compete with existing or new competitors in the markets in which it operates. In addition, FFG intends to launch a variety of new products and expand into new price points and market segments, and may not successfully compete with existing or new competitors in such markets. For instance, FFG expects to introduce new products across the price spectrum, including expanding its premium line of products. However, an increase in the market share of discounters, which are supermarket retailers which offer a narrow range of grocery products at discounted prices and which typically focus on non-branded products, may adversely affect sales of such premium products. FFG also intends to accelerate and expand its private label, DCA and foodservice offerings. However, margins in these markets tend to be lower than in branded and premium retail offerings, and there is no guarantee that FFG will be competitive in the private label, DCA or foodservice markets or achieve its expected return on investment from these strategies. In addition, FFG cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors or their effect on consumer perceptions or the success of its own advertising and promotional efforts. FFG’s competitors have developed and launched products targeted to compete directly with its products. FFG’s retail customers generally control the shelf space allocations within their stores and may allocate more shelf space to generic or private label products or to FFG’s branded competitors’ products in accordance with their respective promotional strategies. Decreases in shelf space allocated to FFG’s products, increases in competitor promotional activity, aggressive marketing strategies by competitors or other factors may require FFG to reduce its prices or invest greater amounts in advertising and promotion of its products to ensure its products remain competitive. Furthermore, some of FFG’s competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than those of FFG in certain markets. This creates competitive pressures that could cause FFG to lose market share or require FFG to lower prices, increase advertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns. These competitive factors may also restrict FFG’s 42 ----- ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Any inability to continue to respond effectively to these and other competitive pressures could negatively impact FFG’s sales volumes and margins, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Retail B&M sales volumes have declined consistently in recent years and are expected to continue declining, driven by reduced occasions for using spreads (principally due to reductions in the consumption of bread) and shifts towards the consumption of food prepared outside the home, which drives B&M sales volumes into the industrial and foodservice channels where FFG is less well established and where margins are significantly lower. Retailers have tended to reduce the space allocated to B&M on shelves, but at a slower rate than the market decline. However, in the future, retailers may choose to increase the pace of shelf-space reduction in order to free up valuable space for other fast-growing categories. A change in the rate of shelf-space reduction could drive further declines in the overall B&M market. FFG is be particularly exposed to shelf-space reduction as it has numerous brands in most markets. Any worsening of this trend in the B&M market could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Trends within the B&M industry change often and FFG’s failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced demand and price reductions, and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that may affect consumer tastes and preferences include: - dietary trends and attention to different nutritional aspects of foods, - concerns regarding the health effects and sourcing practices relating to specific ingredients and nutrients, - trends regarding the taste profile of spreads, - a shift in preference from non-organic to organic, from GMO to non-GMO, and from non-natural products to natural products, - the availability of competing private label products offered by retailers, - trends toward eating and baking outside of the home, - concerns regarding the public health consequences associated with obesity, and - increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production (in particular those related to palm oil, which is a key ingredient in the production of FFG’s PlantBased Spreads). There has been considerable amount of negative press coverage in recent years of products made from palm oil, due to both health and environmental concerns. This negative press has affected FFG products in several European markets, in particular Spain, France and Italy. There is a risk that this press coverage and the resulting negative consumer perception of products made from palm oil may escalate and spread to other markets in Europe and the rest of the world. While FFG has some palm-oil free products in certain markets, the vast majority our products contain palm-oil and switching to exclusively palm-oil free or even predominantly palm-oil free products is not currently technically feasible or cost effective. FFG’s success will be impacted by its ability to anticipate and identify consumer trends and preferences, and to offer products that appeal to consumer needs and preferences on a timely and affordable basis. In doing so, FFG may also be required to leverage its research and development capabilities, and to utilize management’s ability to launch new or improved products quickly, successfully and on a cost-effective basis. A decrease in demand for FFG’s products due to a shift in consumer tastes or preferences to which FFG is unable to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 43 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

This perception of naturalness combined with strong taste profiles have enabled dairy manufacturers to increase their market share relative to FFG and other manufacturers of Plant-Based Spreads. In 2017, FFG benefitted from record high butter pricing in Europe and this contributed in part to FFG’s improved turnover trends in the second half of 2017.

FFG’s financial success is directly dependent on consumer and customer perception of its brands, including Becel, Rama, Flora, ProActiv, Country Crock, I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!, and Blue Band. The success of FFG’s brands may suffer if its marketing plans, marketing spend levels or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers or if consumer or customer perceptions of FFG’s brands or products change unfavorably. In particular, FFG’s investments in marketing activities for new brands and projects may divert resources from its existing brands, and there can be no assurance that such investments will be successful or that consumer or customer perceptions of its existing brands will not suffer as a result. FFG’s results of operations could be negatively affected if the reputation of one or more of its brands suffers damage due to real or perceived quality issues with its products, or if it is found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations. Any circumstances which publicly damage FFG’s customer goodwill, injures its reputation or damages its business relationships may lead to a broader adverse effect on FFG’s business and prospects by way of loss of business, goodwill, customers, joint venture partners and employees beyond the monetary liability arising directly from the damaging events.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

A key element of FFG’s growth strategy is to introduce new products and re-launch and extend existing product lines in each of the markets in which it operates to counteract decreases in sales of existing products, as well as to increase overall sales of its products. For instance, FFG intends to launch a variety of new products and formats across the price spectrum, including a premium line of Plant-Based Spreads products to enhance its spreadable butter and mélange offering, and to expand its offering in adjacent categories, including sweet spreads and non-dairy milk and plant-based dips. The launch and success of new or modified products are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance as to FFG’s continuing ability to develop and launch successful new products or variations of existing products. While mélanges, non-dairy milk and plant-based dips are all growing segments, other producers have developed leading positions in those markets which FFG may find difficult to challenge. There is also no guarantee that existing FFG brands can stretch into these new segments. The success of FFG’s product development is affected by its ability to anticipate changing consumer trends and preferences, to leverage its research and development capabilities, and to utilize management’s ability to launch new or improved products quickly, successfully and on a cost-effective basis.

FFG will also be dependent on co-packing arrangements with Unilever in certain jurisdictions for a period of time following separation. FFG is dependent on third-party suppliers of raw materials and packaging for its products. FFG’s suppliers may fail to meet timelines or contractual obligations or provide sufficient products, which may adversely affect its business. Certain of FFG’s contracts with key suppliers, such as for the raw materials it uses in its products, are short term and can be terminated by the supplier upon giving advanced written notice. Failure to appropriately structure or adequately manage FFG’s agreements with third parties may adversely affect its supply of products. FFG is also dependent on third parties for most of its warehousing and substantially all of its transportation requirements. Certain factors affecting distribution costs, including oil prices, are either subject to market fluctuations or controlled by FFG’s third-party carriers. Temporary or long-term disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events could impair FFG’s ability to supply products affordably or in a timely manner. If FFG is unable to produce and effectively distribute sufficient quantities in response to demand for its products, consumers may look to purchase alternative or competitive products.

These facilities produced approximately 88% of FFG’s total production volume in 2016. FFG is therefore subject to the risks associated with operating, and must incur potentially significant capital and other expenditures necessary to maintain, its manufacturing facilities, machinery and equipment. FFG must maintain its manufacturing facilities in order to, among other things, keep up with demand for its products, retain sufficient capacity to manufacture new products and increase its margins. If FFG is unable to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity to keep up with demand for its products and ensure that its sales and production teams adequately coordinate their planning and production efforts, FFG risks losing potential product sales. Of the 17 total production facilities, seven will transfer in their entirety to FFG as part of the separation process, and there will be a process of physically splitting the other ten sites where FFG and Unilever production lines exist side-by-side. Certain existing spreads-related production equipment will be relocated from sites that will remain with Unilever to sites that will belong to FFG, in order to create a stand-alone operating profile. FFG has also entered into certain co-packing agreements with Unilever on a transitional basis in locations where certain manufacturing capacity cannot be fully separated. If these arrangements are not implemented as expected or if, once implemented, they have an unexpected impact on FFG’s manufacturing capability, its results of operations could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, FFG has relationships with numerous third-party manufacturing facilities, which produced approximately 9% of FFG’s total production volume in 2016. FFG currently relies on and may continue to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce its products in certain smaller volume or emerging markets which it would not be able to service otherwise. FFG’s third-party manufacturers are required to maintain the quality of its products and to comply with its product specifications and requirements for certain certifications; however, FFG has less control over third-party manufacturing facilities when compared to directly owned facilities. The failure of any third-party manufacturer to produce products that conform to FFG’s standards could materially and adversely affect FFG’s reputation in the marketplace and result in product recalls, product liability claims and economic loss. FFG also faces risks of losing control of its intellectual property when third-party manufacturers require access to its formulas and trade secrets as a condition to doing business with it. 45 ----- Any loss of the use of all or a portion of FFG’s own or contracted third-party facilities due to accidents, fires, explosions, labor issues, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms and earthquakes, supply interruptions, transportation interruptions, human error, mechanical failure, terrorist acts, power outages, discharges or releases of hazardous substances and other environmental issues, or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on FFG and its operations. For example, the consolidated New Century manufacturing plant in Kansas, U.S.A., produces the substantial majority of all FFG products sold in the United States. Another example is DCA production, where the vast majority of FFG’s global volumes are produced at the Kleve factory in Germany. Any loss of the use of all or a portion of any of such key facilities could result in substantial business losses, production delays, third-party lawsuits and significant repair costs, as well as personal injury and/or loss of life, which could materially and adversely affect FFG’s business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows. Moreover, unexpected failures of FFG’s equipment and machinery could result in production delays, turnover loss and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to its employees. In some cases, facilities are designated for certain types of products based on the unique equipment involved and it is more difficult, or impossible, for FFG to shift production of these products among its facilities. Any interruption in production capability may require FFG to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation and could require significant lead time replacing, which could have a negative impact on its profitability and cash flows. A loss or interruption in production at certain of FFG’s facilities could disrupt its operations and affect a large number of customers, decreasing its turnover. The operation of manufacturing facilities also requires FFG to hire, train and evaluate large numbers of production employees, which involves additional labor and employment related risks and uncertainties. FFG and its third-party manufacturers are also subject to losses associated with equipment shutdowns, which may be caused by the loss or interruption of electrical power to manufacturing facilities due to unusually high demand, blackouts, adverse weather, equipment failure or other catastrophic events.

In some markets, FFG buys blended oils. Additional primary inputs include cardboard and plastic packaging materials and utility inputs such as water and energy. FFG obtains substantially all of its raw materials and packaging supplies from third-party suppliers, with raw material and packaging expenditures representing 45% and 15%, respectively, of FFG’s total supply chain costs (35% and 12%, respectively, of FFG’s total costs), in each case in the year ended December 31, 2017. The availability and cost of raw materials and packaging used in FFG’s products are variable and can be significantly affected by a number of factors beyond its control, such as general economic conditions, agricultural policies, government programs, weather conditions such as frosts, drought and floods, and plant diseases, pests and other acts of nature. For example, in 2016 peanut availability was reduced to in part to aflatoxins in Argentinian peanut crops. Because FFG does not control the production of raw materials or packaging materials, it is also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production of such materials based on conditions not within its control. Such conditions include industrial actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, natural disasters, palm oil sustainability issues and boycotts of products or other catastrophic events. As a result, FFG is not assured of continued supply, pricing, or exclusive access to raw materials or packaging materials from any of its suppliers. There can be no assurance that FFG or its manufacturers will be able to obtain alternative sources of raw materials or packaging materials at reasonable prices, or at all, should there be shortages or other unfavorable conditions. FFG enters into forward purchase commitments and other financial hedging transactions to secure the costs of projected commodity inputs needed to produce its products and insulate the business from short-term volatility. These commitments are stated at a firm price, or as a discount or premium from a future commodity price. However, there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will successfully reduce FFG’s exposure to price volatility in the long term. In addition, not all of the commodities that FFG needs for its products can be hedged. As it expands its business into new product categories, FFG may not be able to hedge the prices of all of the commodities which it needs for its business at reasonable prices or at all. FFG’s manufacturing facilities also require additional supply chain inputs to process and produce products, such as labor, electricity, general overhead and transportation. In particular, the price of electricity and other energy resources required in the manufacture, storage and distribution of FFG’s products may be subject to volatile market conditions. A sustained increase in these inbound supply chain costs can also affect the cost of manufacturing products. These costs may also fluctuate significantly over time due to factors that are beyond FFG’s control, which could have an adverse effect on FFG’s business. 47 ----- FFG’s inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for its products or other supply chain inputs at reasonable prices, or at all, as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could cause an increase in FFG’s cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in its margin, or cause its sales and earnings to fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may result in a decrease in gross margin and could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, results of operations and financial conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Even if FFG is able to pass through increases in prices, there is typically a time lag between cost increases affecting its business and the implementation of product price increases, which are ultimately within the discretion of the retailer, during which time FFG’s margin may be reduced. A time lag in the recovery of cost inflation, driven by either commodity cost increases or changes in the foreign exchange rate of the currency the commodity is denominated in, can also negatively impact FFG’s margins. In addition, during negotiations to increase prices to recover commodity cost increases, retailers may take actions which exacerbate the impact of such cost increases. FFG’s inability to pass through price increases in commodities and packaging materials and preserve its profit margins in the future could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Throughout FFG’s markets, and particularly in Developed Markets (where FFG derived 79% of its turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017), the food retail segments are highly concentrated. In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s top five customers in each of its top ten markets accounted for between approximately 40% to 90% of turnover in each such market. In recent years, the major retailers in many of FFG’s key markets have increased their share of the grocery market through consolidation and formation of buying groups, and price competition between retailers has intensified. This price competition has led the major retailers to seek lower prices from their suppliers, including FFG, and to reject price increases. The strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position gives them significant leverage over their suppliers in negotiating pricing, product specification and the level of supplier participation in promotional campaigns and offers, which can reduce FFG’s margins. Further consolidation among the major retailers or disproportionate customer growth in relation to their competitors could increase their relative negotiating power and allow them to force a negative shift in FFG’s trade terms. FFG’s results of operations could also be adversely affected if it is required to reduce its prices or increase its promotional spending activity as a consequence of an increase in the strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position, if it loses business from a major retail customer or if its relationship with a major customer deteriorates. Food retailers, including mainstream grocery chains which carry FFG products as well as discount chains (such as Aldi and Lidl) which tend not to carry major brands, also offer generic or private label products that compete directly with FFG’s products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that FFG’s customers may give higher priority to private label products or the branded products of its competitors, which would adversely affect sales of FFG’s products. Moreover, given the growth in market share of discount grocery chains, there is a risk that consumers could increasingly shop at discount chains offering only private label products, which would adversely affect sales of FFG’s products and put increasing pressure on FFG’s mainstream grocery chain customers. In the event FFG tenders to supply private label products to certain retailers, it may win back some volume but at the expense of lower turnover and margins. FFG may be unable to adequately respond to these trends and, as a result, the volume of its sales may decrease or it may need to lower the prices of its products, either of which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 48 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG manages its exposure to credit risk through credit analysis and monitoring procedures, and sometimes uses letters of credit, prepayments and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies cannot fully eliminate customer credit risk, and to the extent FFG’s policies and procedures prove to be inadequate, it could negatively affect FFG’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of FFG’s customers, particularly in emerging markets, may be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks and, even if FFG’s credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, it may experience financial losses in its dealings with such parties. FFG does not maintain credit insurance to insure against customer credit risk. If FFG’s customers fail to fulfil their contractual obligations, FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected. FFG is also subject to credit risk with respect to its third-party suppliers. If any such suppliers become insolvent, an appointed trustee could potentially ignore the service contracts FFG has in place with such party, resulting in increased charges or the termination of the service contracts. FFG may not be able to replace a service provider within a reasonable period of time, on as favorable terms or without disruption to its operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG also claims proprietary rights in various patented and unpatented technologies, know-how, trade secrets (including formulas), trademarks and service marks relating to its products and manufacturing processes. FFG’s ability to implement its business plan depends in part on its ability to expand brand recognition using trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including for its brand names and logos, and on its ability to exploit its proprietary knowledge with respect to manufacturing processes. If existing contractual measures fail to protect FFG’s proprietary rights, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes its intellectual property (including by reverse-engineering FFG’s products or manufacturing processes), any advantage those proprietary rights provide may be negated and the value of FFG’s brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on its business and might prevent its brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. Moreover, as FFG moves into new and additional distribution channels for its products, such as foodservice and private label, and as FFG manages turnover of employees over time, it may become increasingly difficult for FFG to fully protect its intellectual property (including trade secrets and know-how). Monitoring infringement of intellectual property rights is difficult and FFG cannot be certain that the precautions it has taken will prevent the unauthorized use of its intellectual property (including trade secrets and know-how), particularly in countries where it does not have trademarks or patents at all or where the laws of such country may not protect its proprietary rights as adequately as the laws of the European Union or the United States. As FFG expands its operations into new markets, it becomes increasingly exposed to intellectual property laws which may prove to be inadequate for protecting its rights. Accordingly, other parties, including competitors, may duplicate FFG products using its proprietary technologies. Pursuing legal remedies against persons infringing FFG’s owned or licensed intellectual property rights or otherwise improperly using its proprietary information is a costly and time-consuming process that could divert resources from the conduct of FFG’s business. When FFG or its licensor seeks to enforce their respective intellectual property rights, defendants are permitted to challenge the validity of the relevant intellectual property, which could have the impact of invalidating or limiting the scope of FFG’s owned or licensed intellectual property, which may cause harm to its image, brand or competitive position. In addition, patent infringement cases can involve hearings in which the court determines the boundaries of the patent in dispute, which could limit the utility of FFG’s or its licensor’s patents. FFG relies on a combination of registered trademark rights and common law rights or unfair competition protection (which in each case may offer less protection than registered trademarks) to protect FFG’s brands in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. There can be no assurance that 49 ----- FFG will be able to enforce these rights for current products, or register trademarks or obtain common law or unfair competition protection in relation to its brands (such as “Flora,” “Becel,” “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!,” “Country Crock,” “Rama” or “Blue Band”) for any new product lines FFG may introduce.

FFG sells food products for human consumption, which subjects it to safety risks such as product contamination, spoilage, misbranding or product tampering. Product contamination, including the presence of a foreign object, substance, chemical or other agent or residue could require product withdrawals or recalls or the destruction of inventory, and could result in negative publicity, temporary plant closures and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. FFG is also subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread contamination. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products in response to public health concerns and consumers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy. FFG may be harmed by publicity concerning any assertion that its products caused illness or injury, and could become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness stemming from product contamination or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of its products. Any significant lawsuit or widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of FFG’s products could damage its brand, reputation and image and negatively affect its sales, profitability and prospects for growth. In addition, product recalls are difficult to foresee and prepare for and, in the event FFG is required to recall one or more of its products, such recall may result in damage to our brands’ image, loss of sales and diversion of management’s time and attention. FFG maintains systems designed to monitor food safety risks and requires its suppliers to do so as well. However, FFG cannot guarantee that its efforts will be successful or that such risks will not materialize. In addition, although FFG attempts, through contractual relationships and regular inspections, to control the risk of contamination caused by third parties in relation to the manufacturing and distribution processes it outsources, FFG cannot guarantee that its efforts will be successful or that contamination of its products by third parties will not materialize. FFG could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury or death stemming from the consumption of a misbranded, altered, contaminated or spoiled product, which could negatively affect FFG’s business. Awards of damages, settlement amounts and fees and expenses resulting from such claims and the public relations implications of any such claims could have an adverse effect on FFG’s business. The availability and price of insurance to cover claims for damages are subject to market forces that FFG does not control, and such insurance may not cover all the costs of such claims and would not cover damage to its reputation. Even if product liability claims against FFG are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time consuming, increase FFG’s insurance premiums and divert management’s time and resources towards defending them rather than operating the business. In addition, any adverse publicity concerning such claims, even if unfounded, could cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of FFG’s products and damage its reputation and brand image. Evolving nutritional and health-related concerns have led to negative publicity in the food industry concerning the health implications of GMOs, palm oil, obesity, trans fat, diacetyl and artificial growth hormones. In particular, the food industry has been experiencing a significant trend in which an increasing number of consumers are requiring only non-GMO and other specialized ingredients in their foods. Legislation could also require companies to move to non-GMO labelling or other higher cost ingredients. This could result in changes to FFG’s labelling, advertising and/or packaging or require it to purchase non-GMO ingredients, which would increase its costs. Sourcing non-GMO and other specialized ingredients increases costs because such raw materials are generally less widely available and therefore more expensive and FFG may not be able to increase its prices to reflect this increased 50 ----- cost. As additional retailers require or consider requiring all of their products to be non-GMO, additional pressure may come to bear on manufacturers to find sources of raw materials which are non-GMO. This may be particularly difficult in the United States, where most farmers produce genetically modified foods, causing it to be difficult to source non-GMO ingredients and raw materials. Companies that fail to source non-GMO and other specialized ingredients could, over time, lose market share, suffer harm to their brand images and face decreasing sales. Consumers may increasingly require that foods meet stricter standards than are required by applicable governmental agencies, which would further increase the cost of manufacturing such foods and ingredients.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The extent and impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which FFG operates. For example, the U.S. business typically experiences three “peaks” in sales during the year: a spike in the fourth quarter which is driven by Christmas baking, an increase in sales in the first quarter due to Easter, and a spike in sales during the third quarter due to “back to school” baking. Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak in margarine use for cooking and baking during the Ramadan festival season, which can occur in various quarters from year to year. Furthermore, across all the countries in which we operate, the timing of product promotions drives volatility from normal consumption. Finally, weather has some limited impact on sales, because hot weather reduces consumer appetite for spreads products. While FFG’s sales are seasonal, many of the business’s expenses, such as personnel costs, are incurred more evenly throughout the year, which could affect measures of profitability in the short term and put pressure on our working capital position.

There can be no assurance that FFG will be able to maintain or grow its sales and profitability in emerging markets. Such inability may be caused by any one or more of the following factors: - unfavorable economic conditions, including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; highly inflationary currency, devaluation or fluctuation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including austerity or stimulus measures, to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of the countries in which FFG’s products are sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which FFG’s products are sold; - reduced demand for FFG’s products resulting from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or private label products or other lower-cost products, or to less profitable channels; 51 ----- - unstable political or social conditions, including a lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; or - acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest. These factors may reduce demand for FFG’s products in emerging markets, including by changing consumer preferences and reducing discretionary spending levels, as well as negatively impact FFG’s ability to operate its business in such markets, including through restrictions on advertisements of its products and the nationalization or government-mandated closure of FFG’s local manufacturing facilities and assets or those of its third-party suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. In addition, even in Emerging Markets where FFG operates profitably, foreign exchange controls, capital controls and other limitations on the convertibility and flow of currency may restrict FFG’s ability to repatriate its earnings from such countries, which would hamper its ability to deploy its capital most effectively. Conditions in the emerging markets from which FFG sources certain key raw materials, including palm oil, may also adversely affect FFG’s business, in particular if they result in restrictions on the purchase and sale, or otherwise limit the availability, of such raw materials. In addition, FFG may become subject to new or increased sanctions against, or other regulations restricting economic contact with, the emerging markets in which it has a presence or otherwise sources its raw materials. FFG may also incur increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex and evolving foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to FFG’s international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.

As a result, FFG’s business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements, economic conditions and unforeseeable developments in these markets, all or any of which could result in disruption of its activities. These risks include, among others, political instability, differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions, unexpected changes in regulatory environments, currency exchange rate fluctuations, inability to collect payments or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague commercial or other laws, changes in distribution and supply channels, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds, and difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees.

FFG is also exposed to reputational risks connected to a potential failure to manage and properly implement these growth initiatives. New international markets could develop more slowly than we expect at any given time. Entry into a new market may require a local manufacturing or distribution partner, which may be difficult to obtain or 52 ----- slow down the speed of expansion.

On June 23, 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and on March 29, 2017 the U.K. government formally initiated the withdrawal process. The terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last until March 2019; thus, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Since the Brexit referendum, the pound sterling has experienced increased volatility, particularly versus the U.S. dollar and Euro, as a result of which FFG has experienced adverse impacts on consumer demand and suppliers’ profitability in the U.K. and other markets. For example, in the first quarter of 2017, negotiations with large retail customers in a number of developed markets (including the U.K.) were unusually prolonged due to price increases implemented by Unilever in response to the heightened commodity price environment, which was exacerbated in the U.K. by the fall in the value of the pound sterling after the Brexit referendum. While the situation was resolved in the second half of 2017 (albeit with some lasting impact on full year financial performance), there can be no assurance that similar issues will not arise in future years. In addition, Brexit has introduced general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which FFG operates. Depending on the terms of Brexit, the United Kingdom could also lose access to the EU single market and beneficial terms, resulting in an adverse impact on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom. FFG also faces the risk that raw materials and finished products imported into the U.K. will face tariffs after Brexit is implemented. Changes may occur in regulations that FFG is required to comply with as well as amendments to treaties governing tax, duties and tariffs, among other things, which could adversely impact its operations and require it to modify its financial and supply arrangements. Additionally, political instability in the European Union as a result of Brexit may have a material negative effect on credit markets and foreign direct investments in the EU and U.K. This deterioration in economic conditions could result in increased unemployment rates, increased short- and long-term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, a decline in the strength of national and local economies, and other results that negatively impact household incomes. Further, a number of FFG’s employees in the U.K. are not U.K. citizens and, depending on the terms negotiated, may no longer have the right to work in the U.K. following the U.K.’s formal withdrawal from the EU.

Regulations of the European Parliament and Council published in October 2011 changed rules relating to the presentation of nutritional information on packaging and other rules on labelling. It is unclear how this will be impacted by Brexit but there may be changes and further regulations to which FFG will be required to adhere. Local governmental authorities also set out health and safety related conditions and restrictions. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject FFG to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, product recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the regulatory environment could also lead to increased costs. In addition, FFG’s manufacturing facilities as well as those of its suppliers and third-party manufacturers are subject to licensing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities. These governmental authorities include national and local health, environmental, labor relations, sanitation, building, zoning, and fire and safety departments. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licenses or approval could delay or prevent the development, expansion or operation of a given production or warehouse facility. Any changes in those regulations may require FFG to implement new quality controls and possibly invest in new equipment, which could delay the development of new products and increase FFG’s operating costs. All of FFG’s products must comply with strict national and international hygiene regulations. FFG’s facilities and its suppliers’ facilities are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms and other raw materials.

Finally, any attempt to expand production may attract the scrutiny of European and other competition and anti-trust regulators, and such an attempt may not succeed.

Failure to comply with applicable requirements, or the terms of required permits, can result in penalties or fines, clean-up costs, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, which could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s brand, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which FFG operates or from which it sources raw materials and ingredients become more stringent in the future, the extent and timing of investments required to maintain compliance may exceed FFG’s budget or estimates and may limit the availability of funding for other investments. Furthermore, under some environmental laws, FFG could be liable for costs incurred in investigating or remediating contamination at its facilities, even if the contamination was caused by an unrelated party, and even if the activity which caused the contamination was legal at the time it occurred. The discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new or more burdensome obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at FFG’s properties or at third-party sites, could result in substantial unanticipated costs which could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In certain jurisdictions, FFG is also subject to legislation designed to significantly reduce industrial energy use, carbon dioxide emissions and the emission of ozone depleting compounds more generally. If FFG fails to meet applicable standards for energy use reduction or is unable to decrease, and in some cases eliminate, certain emissions within the applicable period required by relevant laws and regulations, it could be subject to significant penalties or fines and temporary or long-term disruptions to production at its facilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as FFG’s reporting currency is the euro but a significant proportion of its sales are denominated in the various currencies of the countries in which it sells its products; 65% of FFG’s turnover in the year ending December 31, 2017 was denominated in currencies other than the euro. FFG does not currently hedge against this translational foreign exchange risk. FFG is also exposed to transactional foreign exchange risk due to the fact that a significant portion of its raw material purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars or are otherwise heavily influenced by U.S. dollar fluctuations, for example the price of plastic packaging materials, even if quoted in euros or some other currency, is influenced by crude oil prices which are set in dollars. FFG intends to reduce this risk by hedging it’s major currency exposures; however, such hedging arrangements may not fully protect FFG against currency fluctuations. Fluctuations and sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate against FFG’s operating currencies may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG maintains an amount of insurance protection that it believes is adequate, but there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that FFG’s insurance coverage will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all liabilities to which it may be subject. FFG could, for example, be subject 55 ----- to substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of several events within one calendar year.

The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Dutch tax law does not provide for interest deduction restrictions with respect to third party debt taken up by the Issuer, the proceeds of which are used to grant interest-bearing loans. Interest payments to the holders of the Notes are not subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax. According to the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, the Netherlands must introduce an interest deductibility limitation rule effective from January 1, 2019. Under such rule, net interest due in excess of 30% of the Issuer’s EBITDA is not deductible in that calendar year. Net interest due means interest income minus interest expenses. Furthermore, the Dutch government has announced that Dutch financial institutions, which generally realize a positive interest margin and should thus not be affected by the new 30% EBITDA rule, may become subject to thin capitalization legislation. If the Issuer is affected by either of the aforementioned provisions, the Issuer may no longer be able to (fully) deduct the interest expenses due to the holders of the Notes as a result of which the Dutch corporate income tax burden may increase. The Dutch tax rate is currently 25% (a reduced rate applies to the first €200,000 of taxable profit). In addition, the Dutch government has announced its intention to introduce a withholding tax on interest payments to lenders resident in low tax countries and non-cooperative countries, as listed by the European Commission.

The Collateral, together with certain other assets not pledged in favor of the Notes, also secures our obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. In addition, the Collateral may secure certain hedging obligations which we may enter into. The Indenture also permits the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral 56 ----- pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure on the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then-outstanding claims under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the security agent for the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, certain hedging arrangements and any additional secured debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In general, lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any other permitted future senior secured debt will have, subject to certain restrictions, the ability to provide enforcement instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the shared Collateral. Such creditors may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Similarly, the principal amount of the Proceeds Loan from the Issuer to Midco, which also comprises part of the Collateral, could be reduced through repayment or the terms of the Proceeds Loan could be amended. Your rights to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the priority of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to enforce the Collateral. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may in the meantime significantly decrease. Furthermore, the security interests may be subject to certain 57 ----- limitations on enforcement or may be limited by applicable law or may be subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity or enforceability. For additional information relating to limitations on enforceability of Collateral and enforcement proceedings generally, see “Limitations on Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_ In addition, our business requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted following a change in ownership in an enforcement scenario. Our business is subject to regulations and permit requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with applicable regulations or requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us or the acquired in an enforcement scenario to incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits.

Each Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer will secure the payment of the Notes on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements, and any additional indebtedness secured on the same basis, will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture will provide for general limitation language to the effect that each Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability or indemnification under a Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed/secured by the relevant Guarantor/security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of the Guarantor/security provider without rendering the relevant Guarantee/security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under the applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Security Documents may be restricted under local law. As a consequence of the right to enforce the Security Documents, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. Under German law, to the extent accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheit) such as, for example, pledges over shares, partnership interests, receivables or bank accounts is concerned, the relevant accessory security interest can only be granted to the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured. As a consequence, of such uncertainties or restrictions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (“Parallel Debt”) obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Principal Obligations”). The Dutch law and the German law security interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. As a result, the holders of the Notes will bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been fully tested under Dutch and German law and, to the extent that the security interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are 59 ----- successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral may be released and retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Issuer has confirmed in writing to the Security Agent that it has determined that it is either not possible or not desirable to implement any such refinancing on terms satisfactory to the Issuer by instead granting additional collateral and/or amending the terms of the existing Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, such a release and retaking of collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of the Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of the Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_ Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (nachträgliche Übersicherung) (where the value of the relevant security interest subsequently significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the 60 ----- amount of the secured obligations), or security interest can even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive over-collateralization (anfängliche Übersicherung).

The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to perfect the Collateral. Under Dutch law, a right of pledge over receivables can be created in two manners, by means of (i) a disclosed right of pledge which is disclosed to the debtor, or (ii) an undisclosed right of pledge. A disclosed and undisclosed right of pledge can both be created by means of a notarial deed or private deed non-notarial agreement. As a general rule under Dutch law, disclosed rights of pledge are created in respect of, inter alia, account receivables, insurance receivables, intercompany receivables and hedging receivables, while undisclosed rights of pledge are created in respect of trade receivables. A disclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment a debtor receives a notification of such right of pledge. An undisclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment that (a copy of) the agreement is submitted to the Dutch tax authorities if such agreement is executed as a private deed or perfected at the moment of execution, if such agreement is executed as a notarial deed. For undisclosed rights of pledge over receivables, the relevant debtor may validly discharge its obligations under the relevant pledged receivable by paying the pledgor. As soon as the debtor is notified of the right of pledge, the debtor is only able to validly discharge its obligations by making payments to the pledgee.

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated (as applicable). In each such case, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

With respect to Dutch law, transactions can in certain circumstances be returned to a bankruptcy estate or a company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest or provided a guarantee that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not 61 ----- considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment.

If there is a payment default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, or if a senior payment stop notice is issued following a non-payment event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, then payments by the Guarantors and the Issuer will not be permitted to be made in respect of the Notes unless the payment is funded directly or indirectly with amounts which have not been received by a Guarantor or the Issuer from another FFG company. In some circumstances, for instance where payments were received on the Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders would be required to turn over such payments to the Security Agent for redistribution. In addition, although the holders of the Notes are generally entitled to enforce their claims against the Issuer pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement nevertheless places limits on enforcement to the extent it would prejudice the enforcement by senior creditors of their security granted by the Issuer.

The Notes will be issued by Sigma Holdco B.V., which is organized under the laws of the Netherlands, and may be guaranteed by entities formed or incorporated in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency event, proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom or in one or more other jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are domiciled.

In addition, because a majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and all or a majority of the assets of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.

If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture or the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may result in a requirement to offer to prepay loans under, an event of default under, or acceleration of, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. In addition, under the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, in certain circumstances we are required to cancel all commitments and repay all amounts borrowed under such agreement. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when FFG is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness 65 ----- to the repurchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that FFG would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to repurchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of _Control.”_ In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if at the time our consolidated leverage ratio is less than certain specified levels. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes— _Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_ The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes— _Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to_ repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations and for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debts and liabilities; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, organic growth projects and for other general corporate purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater financial resources than we have; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and industry; - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors; - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and - limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings. 66 ----- Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, the Indenture and our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, there can be no assurances that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the listing, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market. 70 ----- In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact the liquidity of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream (with respect to the Euro Notes) and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary, or a nominee of DTC (with respect to the Dollar Notes) and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and their participants. Owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled to receive definitive notes in registered form, except under the limited circumstances described in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Definitive Registered Notes.” So long as the Notes are held in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Global Notes. DTC or its nominee, or the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or its nominee, as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes. Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the relevant Paying Agent. The relevant Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to DTC or the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. DTC or the common depositary, or its nominee, will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to DTC or the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the holders of BookEntry Interests. Accordingly, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and, if you are not a participant in DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, on the procedures of the participant through which you hold your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you will be restricted to acting through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures to be implemented through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. 71 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The Issuer is indirectly controlled by KKR. See “Principal _Shareholders.” The Issuer’s shareholder is able to appoint its board of directors and to determine_ corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, the Issuer’s shareholder has control over decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the shareholder could vote to cause the Issuer to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Issuer’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce its ability to generate turnover or, if the assets distributed or sold are Notes Collateral, could reduce the amount of the asset sale proceeds available to repay the Notes, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Notes. Additionally, the Issuer’s shareholder is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with FFG. The Issuer’s shareholder may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to FFG’s business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to FFG. So long as KKR continues to own a significant amount of the Issuer’s capital stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, KKR will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control FFG’s decisions.

The euro equivalent presented in the “Sources” column takes into account the U.S. dollar and pound sterling forward currency arrangements which we have concluded in order to ensure the availability of the required amount of euros on the Completion Date, under which we would be able to convert the proceeds of the U.S. dollar tranche to euros at a rate no worse than $1.2712 per €1.00 and the proceeds of the £445 million portion of the pound sterling tranche to euros at a rate no worse than £0.9072 per €1.00; foreign currency amounts presented in this footnote as euro equivalents (namely, the Polish złoty tranche and the €300 million (equivalent) portion of the pound sterling tranche) are committed in euros as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and will be converted to their final local currency amounts when drawn.

This is subject to change prior to the Completion Date.

We expect our net working capital position to return to a net negative position and largely normalize within 120 days after such payment is made and we expect to repay the Revolving Credit Facility drawing as our working capital position normalizes.

The combined carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared by combining and carving-out the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to FFG. Those amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the Unilever entities running Spreads activities, which also include allocations and recharges by Unilever of indirect central costs and general corporate expenses. The combined carve-out Financial Statements include a cash flow statement showing movement arising from operating, investing and financing activities that is independent of Unilever’s centralized approach to cash management and financing and disclose the cumulative investment of Unilever in FFG as net parent (deficit) / investment. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to FFG include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to FFG, together with an allocation of the items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out Financial Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. The Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect FFG’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows had FFG been a separate entity, or the future results of FFG as it will exist upon the completion of the separation from Unilever.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"FFG is the world’s leading producer of plant-based and other blended spreads, with leading market positions in both developed and emerging markets and products sold in over 69 countries. A historic part of Unilever, FFG will, through the Transactions, become a stand-alone leader in its industry, four times larger than its nearest global-branded competitor, boasting a global portfolio of iconic consumer brands, with seven of its key brands each generating at least €175 million in turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017. FFG has 17 manufacturing facilities located throughout the developed and emerging markets in which it operates, as well as world-class research and development capabilities that have put it at the forefront of the plant-based spreads industry. FFG’s principal product line is Plant-Based Spreads, which accounted for 83% of its turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017. This is complemented by its line of dairy cream alternatives, which represented 6% of turnover for the same period, Liquids products (including liquid margarine, vegetable cooking oils and olive oil), which represented 7% of turnover for the same period, and other products which represented 4% of turnover for the same period. FFG is a market leader in North America and Western Europe and has a strong presence across emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia with number one positions in 44 of its 69 markets. In each of these countries, FFG sells its products predominantly to retail outlets, including to many of the world’s largest retailers and their chains of supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and e-commerce platforms, as well as to wholesalers. FFG also supplies the foodservice channel, including restaurants, hotels, workplace and educational canteens and healthcare facilities. In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, FFG had turnover of €3,294.9 million, €3,031.7 million and €2,904.9 million, respectively, net profit of €453.6 million, €422.5 million and €565.1 million, respectively, and Normalized EBITDA of €723.0 million, €686.3 million and €674.0 million, respectively.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Recent Developments,17.2.1,Current Trading,"FFG reported on a preliminary basis that its turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was €691.2 million (this includes turnover in Portugal of €11.6 million), which is 6.0% or €44.3 million lower than FFG’s turnover of €735.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This was primarily driven by foreign exchange effects. Adjusted for constant currency, USG year on year performance was -0.3% which shows the continuing positive momentum of the business. Developed Markets USG of -0.7% was partially offset by Emerging Markets USG of +1.3%. Normalized EBITDA was 78 ----- €165.3 million, which was €3.0 million, or 1.8%, lower than FFG’s Normalized EBITDA of €168.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Savings in Branding and Marketing Investment and other overhead costs contributed to increase FFG’s Normalized EBITDA Margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 by 102 basis points to 23.9% from 22.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This information is based solely on preliminary internal information used by management and is based on assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties.

We caution that the foregoing information has not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors and should not be regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding our financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting Comparability,17.3.1,Historical and New Cost Structures,"FFG historically operated as part of Unilever, which provided substantial infrastructure, management and shared services to the business. We have no history operating as a stand-alone company. Consequently, our future results of operations will exclude costs historically allocated to FFG from Unilever and will include costs and expenses for us to operate as a stand-alone business, and we expect these costs and expenses to be materially different than FFG’s historical cost structure. We will also incur a significant amount of debt in connection with the Transactions. Accordingly, the historical combined financial statements presented in this Offering Memorandum are not indicative of our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The historical combined financial statements presented in this Offering Memorandum include allocations of certain Unilever corporate expenses to the FFG business, including: information technology resources and support; financing, accounting and auditing services; real estate and facilities management services; human resources activities; procurement support; treasury services; distribution and supply chain support; branding and marketing support; legal advisory services; and research and development services. These expenses were allocated to the FFG business using various estimates of the utilization of such services or the benefits received by FFG. Such allocations have been made on the basis of direct usage when identifiable or as a proportion of revenue, adjusted on a line-by-line basis to reflect specific local circumstances when not. These allocated costs are not necessarily representative of the future level of costs in our business as it will exist after the consummation of the Acquisition. As a stand-alone business, we expect to receive services previously provided by Unilever from our internal operations or third-party service providers. However, under our TSAs, we will pay Unilever for certain services for up to 18 months after the consummation of the Acquisition as we transition to stand-alone operations (with an additional 6 month extension option for IT services and shared services). We do not believe that the expenses allocated to us for services historically are at a level we expect to incur after our separation, and the pricing under our TSAs reflects our expected postseparation cost levels. Based on our estimates of the costs we expect to incur as a stand-alone entity, we expect our stand-alone costs to be different across a number of areas. We expect costs to be lower across areas including supply chain, branding and marketing investment, and SG&A overheads, while we expect costs associated with the use of third-party distributors to be higher. Specifically, we expect stand-alone supply chain costs to be approximately €37 million lower and our branding and marketing investment to be approximately €17 million lower than the costs allocated to FFG by Unilever in the year ended December 31, 2017, while we expect costs associated with the use of third-party distributors to be approximately €26 million higher. Furthermore, with respect to the SG&A overheads allocated to FFG by Unilever in the year ended December 31, 2017, we believe that net cost savings based on the stand-alone operating model developed during separation planning with Unilever will amount to approximately €79 million, and that it is useful, when reviewing our historical and pro forma financial information, to: - remove €293 million of net allocated costs for SG&A overheads provided by Unilever in the year ended December 31, 2017; and 79 ----- - add approximately €215 million of estimated annual stand-alone costs for SG&A overheads, which is what we estimate out stand-alone costs would have been during that period to provide replacement corporate services, had we fully transitioned to a stand-alone cost structure base on our own (or third party contractor) service provision, or, to the extent we utilized services provided by Unilever, we paid for them at rates agreed in the TSAs (which reflect these expected reductions in SG&A overheads). The approximately €215 million of estimated annual stand-alone SG&A overhead expenses consist of the following estimated amounts: - €59.3 million in customer development costs related to sales personnel to manage customer relationships, sales agency fees in markets where certain customer relationship functions are or will be outsourced, and sales support costs, such as car lease expenses. - €30.0 million in marketing support costs related to the global and local coordination of communications, advertising, brand strategy, lobbying, marketing personnel and marketing research. - €30.2 million in research and development costs related to the development of manufacturing techniques, the formulation of new products which can be produced with existing manufacturing techniques, packaging development, adapting and testing products in local market sites before release, and the monitoring and implementation of food standards and safety guidelines. - €26.9 million in finance department costs related to functions such as financial reporting and budgeting, performance monitoring, tax strategy and compliance, risk management, insurance, contract management, supply chain finance management, treasury services, cash management and working capital management. - €23.7 million in IT costs related all the main business processes (apart from supply chain IT costs, which are accounted for in supply chain costs). FFG’s current IT environment is fully shared with Unilever, which will only be available for a limited time after the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to a TSA. FFG has developed plans to transition to a fully independent IT environment as a stand-alone business; however, these plans are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—As FFG builds its _information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, it may incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.”_ - €9.2 million in HR costs related to central and local support of payroll and benefits systems, provision of training, HR personnel, as well as other traditional HR functions. - €8.3 million for workplace services related to property management, facilities management and travel services, as well as rent, utility and other operating costs for office space. - €13.7 million across general management, legal and other corporate and local costs. - €13.3 million incentive costs for key management and directors. FFG has engaged several consultants and industry experts to assist it in the analysis of its anticipated stand-alone cost structure. Our estimate of these stand-alone costs is based on several assumptions that we believe are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate. Beyond the stand-alone cost differences in the areas of supply chain, branding and marketing investment, SG&A overheads and the use of third-party distributors described above, management also believes that an additional cost savings and efficiencies in respect of SG&A overheads are achievable promptly upon separation from Unilever, which additional savings are likely to be partly offset by certain increases in stand-alone costs not fully captured in the stand-alone SG&A overhead cost base described above. These additional savings and expenses are not reflected in the standalone operating model developed in cooperation with Unilever and not reflected in the cost structure of the TSAs.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.1,Changes in Policy Upon Separation from Unilever,"Historically, FFG has operated as part of Unilever. In certain respects, Unilever group-wide policies have limited FFG’s ability to implement a growth strategy in a number of respects. Unilever’s financial policy prioritized gross margin preservation, which discouraged the FFG business from pursuing relatively lower margin opportunities in the private label, hard discount retailer and foodservice market segments, which would have provided cash generative sales opportunities that would have increased asset utilization and helped defray fixed overheads. This focus has also resulted in reductions in product fat levels to optimize production costs, often to the detriment of taste and consumer preference, to ensure a stable gross margin. Unilever’s positioning of its product portfolio also had a constraining effect on FFG’s businesses. FFG’s principal products played an important role in Unilever’s wider nutritional agenda to reduce levels of fat (particularly saturated fat) and salt, and as a result, taste and functionality of the spreads products were deprioritized. Now, as a stand-alone business, FFG is working to reframe the health and “naturalness” perception around Plant-Based Spreads, particularly in developed markets, while improving taste and functionality. FFG is reinvesting in taste to improve its existing product offerings and develop new ones, in particular, FFG plans to build on the “free-from” diet and health trend by extending its strongest brands into the dairy-free milk and yogurt alternatives. Further expansion into alternative and sweet spread adjacencies (including chocolate spreads), as well as plant-based dips, to appeal to higher income and health-conscious millennial demographics, also forms a central part of strategy and is supported by underlying consumer consciousness of the benefits of a plant-based diet. Moreover, the historic lack of a sales force dedicated to the spreads business has also meant that FFG’s product category has been deprioritized as it formed a less important part of the broader Unilever sales team portfolio. FFG initiatives did not receive priority, given opportunities in more attractive categories. There was also limited need for Unilever to extend FFG’s brands into adjacent categories as Unilever is already diversified across categories. Management believes that, historically, the speed of product development for the FFG business has been sub-optimal, driven by extensive pre-launch testing and a focus on technical developments, which hampered new product development to improve brand positioning. This constraint has been lifted within FFG more recently, with increased levels and speed of lower cost product innovation now taking place. The separation from Unilever will also affect FFG’s operating model and expected overhead costs, especially when compared to costs historically allocated to the business by Unilever. See “—Historical _and New Cost Structures,” above._",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.2,Commodity Prices,"The principal ingredient in FFG’s margarines and other spreads is vegetable oil, specifically liquid and tropical oils such as rapeseed, soybean, palm and sunflower oils. In the year ended December 31, 2017, raw materials accounted for 44.6% of FFG’s cost of goods sold and 34.6% of total costs. FFG has a sophisticated procurement function that manages the supply of these materials to FFG’s manufacturing operations. While FFG leverages its scale in order to secure attractive pricing and payment terms for its key commodities, it is not immune to fluctuations in price. In particular, its commodity purchasing arrangements expose FFG to transactional foreign exchange risk. Transactional foreign exchange risk arises principally as FFG’s operations in each country sell their products in local currency, but a significant proportion of FFG’s raw materials are purchased in U.S. dollars. Historically, transactional currency risk was managed through physical and contractual hedging coordinated by the Unilever central treasury function, tied to the number of weeks it takes for the business to pass on any cost increases to customers in each territory. Due to raw material stocks and hedging arrangements, a change in the cost of FFG’s raw materials takes between three and six months to flow through to the pricing offered on FFG’s products. The market prices of FFG’s principal raw materials have fluctuated significantly during the course of 2016 and 2017. Most notably, during the second half of 2016, key raw material prices increased considerably due to heightened demand, the impact of weather patterns (El Niño, in particular) and 81 ----- inventory levels across the industry. During the period, prices of palm oil, rapeseed oil and soybean oil increased by 26%, 25% and 19%, respectively. In response to these increases, FFG has passed on price increases to retailers in its emerging markets, but in more recent periods, FFG has chosen not to pass on price increases in certain of its developed markets, including the U.K. and Germany, as a strategic move to avoid diminishing the positive momentum from recent innovation and brand re-launches. The decision in the U.K. was also driven by the adverse response of many of FFG’s principal customers to Unilever’s approach to pricing in response to the devaluation of sterling following the Brexit referendum. Price stability in Germany was kept consistent in order to maintain competitiveness and market share. Certain of FFG’s other developed markets, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and the Czech Republic increased prices in 2017 to help offset the cost increases. FFG will remain exposed to fluctuations in the prices of its key raw materials and its ability to mitigate the impact of those fluctuations through the pricing of its products will need to be balanced against competitive dynamics in its various markets.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.3,Changes in Food Trends and Consumer Preferences,"The B&M industry has experienced sustained negative trends and is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Retail B&M sales volumes have declined consistently in recent years and are expected to continue declining, driven by reduced occasions for using spreads (principally due to reductions in the consumption of leavened bread) and shifts towards the consumption of food prepared outside the home, which drives B&M sales volumes into the industrial and foodservice channels where FFG is less well established. Moreover, butter’s relative share of the overall B&M market has grown in recent years at the expense of the Plant-Based Spreads that FFG produces, due in part to the perception of enhanced naturalness and health of butter products, consumer taste preferences and reduced butter prices in certain markets. Historically, FFG’s financial performance has been adversely impacted by relatively wide market contractions driven by changing consumer preferences in developed markets (such as the switch to spreadable butter and the decline in consumption of leavened bread) and lower butter prices, which have resulted in consumers shifting away from FFG’s core products and resulting in lower sales volumes. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to FFG’s Business and Industry—Established negative trends in the B&M market and changes in consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on FFG’s turnover, results of operations and financial condition.”_ In addition to affecting FFG’s turnover, lower sales volumes also reduce the rate of cost absorption, meaning that in periods where key input costs are higher, margins are adversely impacted to a greater degree than would otherwise be the case. However, during the periods under review, FFG’s supply chain function has been able to mitigate the impact on margins and maintain controllable costs at stable levels through the implementation of savings programs. Management estimates that approximately 80% of FFG’s cost base is variable, allowing for a sustainable gross margin going forward. FFG has consistently operated with a clear approach to fluctuations in commodity and packaging costs in regards to procurement and foreign exchange hedging policies and, as a result, has been able to maintain strong levels of profitability after direct costs in changing cost environments. Moreover, FFG’s ability to effectively leverage its product development expertise to continually update its portfolio in response to changing consumer tastes—especially with the development of innovative premium products—is a key element of its strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Factors Affecting Results of Operations,17.4.4,Customer Pricing,"“Customer pricing” refer to prices that FFG charges to retailers. FFG does not set the prices that retailers charge to end-use consumers in most developed and some emerging markets. The prices paid by its customers for FFG’s products are a key driver of its financial results and are affected by a number of external factors. The consumer prices of FFG’s spreads products are influenced heavily by a substitution effect with the market price of butter. Butter price decline between 2014 and 2016 impacted the ability of spreads producers to increase price, and contributed to FFG volume declines. However, the year ended December 31, 2017 saw increases in butter prices which had a positive effect on the relative prices of FFG’s products, and contributed to the slowdown in FFG volume declines in 2017, as compared to 2015 and 2016. Pricing is also driven by the terms FFG agrees with its major retail customers. FFG usually conducts annual negotiations with most of its large retail customers in developed markets in respect of the 82 ----- supply and pricing of its products in the first quarter of the year. These agreements, often referred to as Joint Business Plans, usually encompass pricing, trade terms, support for new innovation, assortment, distribution and shelf space. In some markets, the agreements also include promotional activity for the year, although in most markets it is still possible to change promotional activity and pricing during the year. In early 2017, these negotiations were unusually prolonged in a number of countries. The impact of these prolonged negotiations dissipated in the second half of 2017 (albeit with some lasting impact on full year financial performance), there can be no assurance that similar issues will not arise in future years given the competitive dynamics of FFG’s industry. For the avoidance of doubt, in territories where resale price maintenance is not permitted, retailers remain free at all times to set levels of retail pricing. Finally, as a stand-alone business, there is some risk that FFG will sustain a loss of pricing power relative to its customers, as its stand-alone product offering will be narrower than Unilever’s pre-separation offering. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever— _Following the separation, we may experience increased costs and decreased pricing power resulting from a decrease in our purchasing and selling power relative to the purchasing power possessed by FFG when it was owned by Unilever.” However, management believes that FFG’s leading position in_ its product categories and its strong iconic brands mitigate these risks.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The extent and impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which FFG operates. For example, the U.S. business typically experiences two “peaks” in sales during the year: a spike in the fourth quarter which is driven by Christmas and Thanksgiving, and an increase in sales due to Easter, either in the first or second quarter depending on the timing of Easter. Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak in margarine use for baking during the Ramadan festival season, which can occur in various quarters from year to year. Furthermore, across all the countries in which we operate, the timing of product promotions drives volatility from normal consumption.

It does not include sales between group companies. Discounts given by the business include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs. Turnover is recognized when the risks and rewards of the underlying products have been substantially transferred to the customer. Depending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. The cost of services that are provided by customers directly to FFG, such as merchandising, listing new products and in-store advertising, is reported under trade terms and hence deducted from turnover.

Research and development spend is fully expensed. - Indirect costs primarily relate to FFG’s sales force, merchandising activities, general management, marketing teams and general marketing indirects. - General corporate and local market expenses primarily relate to the finance, legal, IT, HR, communications and audit functions. During the periods presented, other indirect central costs and general corporate expenses incurred by Unilever were systematically recharged to FFG business units as management charges in accordance with Unilever’s historical internal methodology. These management charges are recharged by Unilever on the basis of direct usage when identifiable or are based on a proportion of revenue, adjusted on a line-by-line basis to reflect specific local circumstances, when not. These recharged costs and expenses: - are deemed to have been settled by FFG to Unilever in the period in which these costs were accrued; and - are influenced by the management and recharge arrangements that existed within the Unilever group and are not necessarily representative of the future level of costs for FFG as it will exist upon completion of the separation from Unilever. FFG historically operated as part of Unilever, which provided substantial infrastructure, management and shared services to the business, including with respect to the items described above.

FFG’s business is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates.

Adjusting for constant currency, the underlying sales growth or USG was -2.7%. Negative sales growth was driven by volume pressure in Developed Markets, partially offset by growth within Emerging Markets. _Developed markets_ Developed Markets turnover decreased by €127.1 million, or -5.2% from €2,429.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €2,302.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -4.2%. This was mainly driven by declines in both North America and Europe. In North America turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by €44.8 million, or -6.7%, to €619.4 million from €664.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -4.2%. This was driven by overall B&M market contraction, changing consumer behavior (including a decrease in bread consumption and further shifts to out of the home dining), a shift to butter or alternative spreads, and price competition. All of these factors affected the U.S. business but had a larger negative impact on the FFG business in Canada. Within North America, turnover in the U.S. in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by €35.5 million, or -6.3%, to €531.1 million from €566.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. In Europe, turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 continued to decline by €83.9 million, or -4.9%, to €1,628.0 million from €1,711.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -3.8%. Within Europe, turnover in Germany in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by €6.7 million, or -2.0%, to €324.8 million from €331.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Turnover in the Netherlands in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by €5.1 million, or -2.5%, to €197.6 million from €202.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Turnover in the UK in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by €40.8 million, or -14.5%, to €240.7 million from €281.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Turnover was adversely impacted in early 2017 due to unusually prolonged negotiations with customers, which was partially offset by price increases realized in the second quarter, supported by brand relaunches and the recovery of butter prices from historic lows beginning in the second quarter of the year. Czech Republic USG was back in growth with USG of +7.8% and there was a slow-down in the rate of decline in Germany and Netherlands with USG of -2.0% and -2.5% respectively. The U.K., however, remained a very challenging market, with a USG of -8.2%. In connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint venture entity (Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG and will fully consolidate its results with FFG’s. The business in Portugal had €48.6 million in turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 and €50.4 million in turnover in the year ended December 31, 2016. _Emerging Markets_ Turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 was relatively flat in Emerging Markets, growing by €0.3 million, or +0.1%, to €602.9 million from €602.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was +3.3%. Within Emerging Markets, turnover in Indonesia in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by €1.8 million, or 2.2%, to €82.3 million from €80.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Turnover in Mexico in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by €11.0 million, or 12.1%, to €102.0 million from €91.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Margarine has been growing significantly in key Emerging Market geographies, primarily driven by volume growth, as the region benefits from favorable macroeconomic drivers (including strong population growth, a rising middle class and growing demand for B&M products). USG in Latin America was +2.6% driven mainly by Mexico USG of +15.6% due to several price increases and also some volume growth. This growth was offset partially by declines in Brazil, where USG was -10.3%, mainly due to macroeconomic challenges. Turnover in Asia was positively affected by a recovery in sales in Sri Lanka following the resumption of production after a fire at FFG’s production facility in that country in 2016, mitigating lower than expected performance in Indonesia. In Africa and the Middle East, turnover growth remains strong due to positive macroeconomic trends in Africa as well as positive pricing conditions in Turkey and Kenya. 87 ----- _Retail and Foodservice_ Global turnover through FFG’s retail channel decreased by €133.2 million, or -4.8%, from €2,775.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €2,641.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -3.4%. This decline was primarily driven by adverse market dynamics in the European and North American markets, partly offset by improving market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets. Global turnover through FFG’s foodservice channel increased by €6.5 million, or +2.5%, from €256.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €263.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was +4.4% driven by price and growth in overall food services market globally. _Product Categories_ FFG’s global turnover in the Plant-Based Spreads product category decreased by €93.9 million, or -3.8%, from €2,492.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €2,398.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, USG in the Plant-Based Spreads category was -2.3%. This decline was primarily driven by adverse market dynamics in the European and North American markets, partly offset by improving market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets. FFG’s global turnover in other product categories decreased by €29.7 million, or -5.7%, from €516.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €486.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 with creams growing turnover by 1.4% while all other markets were in decline. Adjusting for constant currency, USG in other product categories was -4.4%. _Quarterly Evolution_ FFG’s global turnover was 5.5% lower in the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, 3.2% lower in the three months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, 4.2% lower in the three months ended September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 3.9% lower in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, USG saw a decrease of 5.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of 3.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 1.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a decrease of 0.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. In Developed Markets, adjusting for constant currency and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, USG saw a decrease of 8.8% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of 5.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 2.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a decrease of 0.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. In Emerging Markets, adjusting for constant currency and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, USG saw a growth of 7.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, a growth of 4.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, a growth of 0.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a growth of 1.1% in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The improved trend in recent quarters globally has mainly been driven by volume growth in Europe, notably in the U.K. and Germany, which is due to internal factors (including the ongoing implementation of FFG’s new strategies and initiatives, the re-launch or repositioning of certain major brands, such as Rama, Becel and Country Crock, and the launch of innovative new products centered around around “free-from,” organic and plant oil products with strong wellness, taste and plant-based nutrition perceptions) and external factors (namely, increasing butter prices which make margarine a more attractive substitute product). 88 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

This was primarily driven by a spike in commodity prices in the first half of 2017, particularly those of palm, rapeseed, soybean and linseed oils, partially offset by procurement and packaging cost savings initiatives. In North America, certain supply chain disruptions and start-up costs associated with the consolidation of production in the New Century, Kansas, facility in 2016 did not reoccur in 2017, and continued improvement in soybean oil costs and waste and logistics costs in North America has improved performance.

The decrease was driven by a decrease in BMI costs from €269.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €211.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, due to a shift away from television to digital and point-of-sale advertising, a focus on key brands, a reduction of external agency spending and improved planning. The decrease was also driven by a reduction in overheads attributed to the establishment of the BCS entities in Europe and reduced allocations of central costs on account of lower turnover. In connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint venture entity (Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG and will fully consolidate its results with FFG’s.

Declining volumes exacerbated the impact of increased commodity prices, and adverse foreign exchange effects offset by price increases in particular in Emerging Markets and some of the positive fundamental trends in Emerging Markets. FFG was able to pass along the effect of higher commodity prices to its customers in some of its markets but not all of them, leading to margin squeeze in certain markets. Pricing pressure due to the continued low consumer price of butter, particularly in North America, also adversely impacted operating profit. This was partially offset by further rationalization of BMI spend with higher focus on key brands and improved planning, and margins are expected to improve as a result of the cost savings initiatives which have already been implemented as well as those which have been planned.

On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -5.2%. Negative sales growth was driven by volume pressure in Developed Markets, partially offset by growth within Emerging Markets. _Developed Markets_ Developed Markets turnover decreased by €237.7 million, or 8.9% from €2,666.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €2,429.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -7.1%. This was driven largely by declines in both North America and Europe. Within Developed Markets, turnover in North America declined by €46.4 million, or 6.5%, from €710.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €664.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -5.8%. This decline was primarily driven by adverse market dynamics, including a change in consumer behavior and health perceptions of FFG’s products, as well as a shift towards butter or alternative spreads, which led to increased pricing pressure. Turnover in Europe declined by €192.9 million, or 10.1%, from €1,904.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €1,711.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -7.6%, primarily driven by a shrinking market, particularly in regions where there is a strong butter market. The majority of European countries, but particularly the U.K. (USG of -9.8%) and Germany (USG of -8.3%), have been significantly impacted by growth in spreadable butter. These impacts have been offset, in part, by increasingly positive health perceptions of FFG’s products and improvements in historically low butter prices, which have a substitution effect on the pricing of FFG’s products. _Emerging Markets_ Turnover in FFG’s emerging markets increased by €25.5 million, or 4.1%, from €628.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €602.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was +3.2%. The easing of recessionary pressures, particularly in Latin America, supported increases in pricing. Strong market trends in Asia, as well as positive macroeconomic factors in Africa and favorable pricing dynamics in Turkey also helped to drive the growth. _Retail and Foodservice_ Global turnover through FFG’s retail channel decreased by €259.8 million, or 8.6%, from €3,034.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €2,775.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -5.8%. This decline was primarily driven by adverse market dynamics in the European and North American markets, partly offset by improving market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets. Global turnover through FFG’s foodservice channel decreased slightly by €3.5 million, or 1.3%, from €260.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €256.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusting for constant currency the underlying sales growth or USG was +1.5% driven by strong growth in Emerging markets (USG of +7.8%). _Product Categories_ FFG’s global turnover in the B&M product category decreased by €236.0 million, or 8.6%, from €2,751.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €2,515.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This decline was primarily driven by adverse market dynamics in the European and North American markets, partly offset by improving market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets and negative exchange rates. FFG’s global turnover in other product categories decreased by €27.2 million from €543.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €516.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by market decline in developed markets. 91 ----- _Quarterly Evolution_ FFG’s global turnover was 7.7% lower in the three months ended March 31, 2016 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, 9.7% lower in the three months ended June 30, 2016 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, 8.6% lower in the three months ended September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 6.1% lower in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

While the decrease was primarily driven by the reduction in volumes of product produced and sold, it was further decreased beyond the rate of underlying volume declines by the completion of a significant rationalization program at FFG’s North American production facilities which eliminated supply chain inefficiencies that affected results in the year ended December 31, 2015.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The decrease was driven by cost saving initiatives and a decrease in expense allocations from Unilever following the formation of BCS, and to a lesser extent by a reduction in BMI spend from €314.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €269.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 following the reduction of global marketing charges in the year ended December 31, 2016. The internal reorganization of aspects of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities which took place in mid-2015 led to greater autonomy and efficiency in overhead costs, and reductions in centrally allocated services from Unilever. Most savings from the reorganization were realized in 2016. Research and development costs remained stable during this period, increasing slightly from €51.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €52.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Historical selling and administrative expenses may not be indicative of future results going forward due to the replacement of allocated overhead services provided by Unilever with stand-alone overhead services that will be provided internally after the consummation of the Acquisition.

Despite the decline in sales, operating profit was positively impacted by decreases in both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses as discussed above. FFG’s Developed Markets operations saw a decrease in volumes as well as increases in commodity prices, which were only partially offset by a decrease in BMI spend.

657_5,Offerings 2018.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.13,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.13.2,,"Liquidity describes our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are provided by our cash from operating activities, including our net negative working capital position, 93 ----- and our financings. Our principal liquidity requirements arise from the need to settle supplier payables and fund our ongoing operations. During the periods under review, the liquidity needs of the business were mainly funded from cash from operations, including our net negative working capital position. FFG’s business is cash generative and during the periods under review it has operated with negative net working capital, driven by longer credit terms received on purchases from its suppliers compared to those offered to its customers. Particularly in its developed markets, trade receivables are net of trade term rebates and trade payable days are significantly longer than inventory and receivables days. Historically, FFG has managed its trade payables on typically 90 to 120 day terms and managed its receivables on typically 30 day terms. FFG also offer additional discounts to customers in many markets for “prompt payment”, which is defined as payment in less than 30 days. This net negative working capital balance also exists in FFG’s emerging markets, but to a lesser extent. In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s payable days to suppliers globally were 114, versus average inventory days of 25 and receivable days from customers of 20. We are exposed to the risk that after the separation from Unilever our working capital position and operating cash flows could deteriorate due to changes in terms with customers or suppliers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s _Separation from Unilever—Changes to FFG’s payment terms with customers or suppliers may adversely affect its working capital position and operating cash flows.”_ In connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever (i) FFG’s rights to collect receivables associated with sales of its products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) its obligations to satisfy the payables associated with raw materials received prior to the Completion Date. This is because the receivables and payables associated with FFG’s operations pre-separation are generally incorporated within collective invoices which span products sold or supplies used across the Unilever group. In addition, we expect FFG’s inventories of raw materials and finished products on hand on the Completion Date to be conveyed with the business. We have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing the average net negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and finished products conveyed with the business on the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily our net negative working capital position. While the foregoing amounts cannot be known with precision as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we estimate that the aggregate amount we will pay to Unilever on account of the the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position will be in the range of €350 million to €450 million and we expect that this amount will be paid on or about the Completion Date. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to make this payment. This is subject to change prior to the Completion Date. While we expect our net working capital position to return to a net negative position and largely normalize within 120 days after such payment is made, there can be no guarantee that all of these transactions will occur as and when expect and that our net working capital position will in fact normalize on that schedule, or at all. Changes to trade terms available to us after the separation brought about by our reduced scale, as well as fluctuations in the underlying market prices or sales volumes for our products or the raw materials we consume, could each delay or prevent the expected normalization of our net working capital position; moreover, technical difficulties in valuing inventories and reconciling accounts may delay the date of such payment in respect of the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position. After the consummation of the Transactions, we will have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had outstanding €4,959.7 million in aggregate indebtedness, with an additional €700 million of borrowing capacity available under our new Revolving Credit Facility. €350 million to €450 million of this borrowing capacity is expected to be drawn to make the working capital reimbursement to Unilever described above, which will be a substantial short-term demand on our liquidity. We expect to repay this drawing as our working capital position normalizes. Moreover, our substantial indebtedness will significantly increase our long-term liquidity requirements, primarily due to debt service requirements. Furthermore, we will require additional liquidity to meet the expenses and capital expenditures that FFG expects to incur to transition to a stand-alone business. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately €200 million in transition-related expenses and one time expenditures, including 94 ----- approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs which we expect to incur as FFG transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform, and approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as new head offices are equipped globally. The substantial majority of the IT expenses are expected to be incurred through December 31, 2019. To meet these additional liquidity needs going forward, we expect our sources of liquidity will consist mainly of the following: - cash generated from our operating activities; - borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities; - issuances of debt securities; and - borrowings under other loan facilities. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity needs, working capital requirements, separationrelated expenditures and debt service obligations for the next twelve months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund all of our other projected liquidity needs. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which could be due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole; - increased commodity costs which we cannot pass onto customers; - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings which bear interest at a variable rate, including our Senior Term Facilities and our Revolving Credit Facility; - changes in trade terms or market conditions which might imperil our ability to maintain a net negative working capital position consistent with past practice; and - higher capital expenditure, such as due to higher than expected expenses incurred in connection with our product innovation and growth strategies. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinancing all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the terms of any future debt.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

This largely is a structural feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and finished product markets in which FFG operates, and while there are some risks to FFG’s ability to maintain its working capital cycle on precisely these terms going forward (such as those associated with its reduced scale following the separation from Unilever, and the potential ending of certain supplier financing arrangements previously sponsored by Unilever), this cycle is not expected to shift fundamentally upon the separation from Unilever. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever— _Changes to FFG’s payment terms with customers or suppliers may adversely affect its working capital position and operating cash flows.” This cycle is also a result of FFG’s operational efficiency with_ respect to its inventory management, in which management believes there is scope for improvement upon the separation from Unilever. FFG’s working capital is comprised of inventory, trade payables and trade receivables. Movements in FFG’s working capital historically have been driven by changes in sales volumes which impact levels of receivables. These movements are calculated based on Unilever’s allocations of movements in trade payables and trade receivables to FFG, and these results may be different from those FFG would have presented had it been a stand-alone business during the periods presented. Over the periods presented, FFG has maintained relatively stable days outstanding on receivables as well as inventory days while trade payable days outstanding have increased. The change in working capital in the year ended December 31, 2016 was an inflow of €12.1 million, compared to an inflow of €54.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher inflow in 2015 was driven by higher levels of trade payables. The change in working capital in the year ended December 31, 2017 was an inflow of €28.0 million, compared to an inflow of €12.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2016.

Precise volumes and prices of products supplied are not typically locked into these contracts in advance. With respect to its supply chain, FFG enters into cash-settled hedging arrangements with counterparties in the commodity markets to hedge pricing risks. FFG also enters into physical forwards and spot or near-spot supply contracts with a range of reputable, high-quality suppliers of edible oils and other essential inputs. FFG has a small number of long-term supply contracts with raw materials suppliers, typically in situations where a long-term contract helps such supplier mitigate startup risks or ramp-up / ramp-down costs, thus improving the pricing terms available to us.

It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future. Contingent liabilities are disclosed at the risk adjusted best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the liability as at the balance sheet date. Where a risk weighting is not available, the maximum exposure is reported. In connections with the Transactions, Unilever gave us an indemnity in respect of certain historic claims, which management expects will mitigate the cost of potential contingent liabilities. During 2016, one of Unilever’s subsidiaries in Israel became the subject of an application for certification of a class action claim based on allegations of unfair pricing in the margarine market. The claim, which has not been certified by the court, would, if so certified, be for approximately €33 million. Unilever intends to robustly defend this claim and believe that the likelihood that the plaintiff will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. Therefore the matter has not been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Additionally, in March 2018, a Unilever subsidiary in Greece received a Statement of Objections from the Hellenic Competition Commission for alleged violations of competition law in the margarine sector from 1996 until today. Unilever is still assessing the implications from this complex case and is unable to assess the level of any potential fine. Should the allegations be upheld, the maximum fine which could be levied under Greek law is 10% of turnover, which would be approximately €40 million. Unilever intends to defend these allegations robustly, although there is no guarantee of success, and therefore the matter has not been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Finally, in 2015 a class action lawsuit was filed against one of Unilever’s subsidiaries in California based on allegations of deceptive labelling and marketing of the “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!” brand. The case had been stayed since 2015 pending rulings in another appellate matter, but the stay was lifted in 2017 and class certification discovery is now ongoing. A decision on class certification is expected in 2019. Unilever intends to robustly defend this claim and has not reserved any amounts in connection with this litigation.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Indebtedness in respect of our Senior Term Facilities is presented based on its principal amount rather than the carrying value it would have on our balance sheet. The euro equivalent presented here takes into account the U.S. dollar and pound sterling forward currency arrangements which we have concluded in order to ensure the availability of the required amount of euros on the Completion Date, under which we would be able to convert the proceeds of the U.S. dollar tranche to euros at a rate no worse than $1.2712 per €1.00 and the proceeds of the £445 million portion of the pound sterling tranche to euros at a rate no worse than £0.9072 per €1.00; foreign currency amounts presented in this footnote as euro equivalents (namely, the Polish złoty tranche and the €300 million (equivalent) portion of the pound sterling tranche) are committed in euros as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and will be converted to their final local currency amounts when drawn. For a description of the terms of the Senior Term Facilities, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior _Credit Facilities Agreement—Senior Term Facilities.”_ 2) On or about the Completion Date, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility temporarily to make a working capital payment to Unilever. In connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever (i) receivables associated with sales of FFG’s products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) payables associated with raw 98 ----- materials received by FFG prior to the Completion Date. We have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing the average net negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and finished products conveyed with the business on the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily our net negative working capital position. This negative net working capital position fluctuates over time as volumes and pricing in FFG’s markets evolve. Accordingly, while the amount of the payment to Unilever cannot be known with precision as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we estimate that the aggregate amount we will pay to Unilever on account of the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position will be in the range of €350 million to €450 million and that this amount will be paid on or about the time the Acquisition is consummated. This is subject to change prior to the Completion Date. Given the expected temporary and one-time nature of the drawing, driven by the mechanics of FFG’s separation from Unilever, this drawing is not reflected in this table. We expect our net working capital position to return to a net negative position and largely normalize within 120 days after such payment is made and we expect to repay the Revolving Credit Facility drawing as our working capital position normalizes.

FFG’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: - Commodity price risk: The key commodities used by FFG are rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, palm stearin and palm kernel oil. Management aims to minimise the impact of commodity market volatility on (gross) margin and allow time to take corrective pricing action. Commodity hedging is undertaken based on 100% of the volume exposure around the pricing horizon, although hedging can be undertaken up to 52 weeks with approval and within limits. - Currency risk: FFG’s reporting currency is the euro. Its turnover is generally denominated in the functional currencies of the markets in which FFG sells its products; the most significant of these are the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. FFG’s operating costs (apart from commodity inputs) are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the jurisdictions in which its operations (including manufacturing plants and 100 ----- distribution hubs) are located, which in most cases correlate to the markets and currencies in which its sales are made. However, FFG is exposed to movements in the underlying currency of transacted commodity prices that are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. A layered hedging approach of up to 12 months is used to hedge this foreign currency transaction exposure. FFG does not hedge against translation risks that arise from the translation of local currency income statement or balance sheet results into euros. Following the Transactions, we will also be exposed to currency risk related to indebtedness denominated in various currencies, principally the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. We are managing this risk by implementing the natural hedge of incurring different tranches of our indebtedness under our Senior Term Facilities in the various principal currencies in which FFG’s turnover is denominated. - Interest rate risk: Our exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. Historically, since we did not have long-term borrowings with floating interest rates, we did not use derivative instruments to hedge interest risk. In connection with the proceeds from the bond and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement we may enter into derivative hedging to hedge interest risk.

Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgments are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies, as well as estimates and assumptions that have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: - Operating costs and non-underlying items: - Brand and marketing investment: Brand and Marketing investment includes costs incurred for the purpose of building and maintaining brand equity and awareness. These include media, advertising production, promotional materials and engagement with consumers. These costs are charged to the income statement as incurred; - Research and development: Expenditure on research and development includes staff costs, material costs, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and other costs directly attributable to research and product development activities. These costs are charged to the income statement as incurred; - Non-underlying items: Non-underlying items include restructuring costs and other one-off items within operating profit, and other significant and unusual items within net profit but outside of operating profit, which Unilever’s spreads business collectively terms 101 ----- non-underlying items due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence. These items are significant in terms of nature and/or amount and are relevant to an understanding of the spreads business’ financial performance. Restructuring costs are charges associated with activities planned by management that significantly change either the scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted; - Taxation: - Income tax: Unilever’s spreads business is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities. These matters of judgment give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice. - Provisions: - Provisions are recognized where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable. - Commitments and contingent liabilities: - Lease payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. - Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. - Assets held under finance leases are initially recognized at the lower of fair value at the date of commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy relating to that specific asset. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. - Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits. It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future. Contingent liabilities are disclosed at the risk adjusted best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the liability as at the balance sheet date. Where a risk weighting is not available, the maximum exposure is reported. Because of the nature of combined financial statements, there are additional critical assumptions and estimates made in preparing the combined financial statements, as explained in “Presentation of Financial_ _and_ _Other_ _Information,”_ “—Explanation _of_ _Certain_ _Income_ _Statement_ _Items”_ and “—Explanation of Certain Balance Sheet Items”. 102 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

According to Euromonitor International (Source: Euromonitor International, Packaged Food 2018 edition, data extracted February 2018), the global retail sales value of the category, which encompasses B&M only since Euromonitor International does not separate mélanges into a distinct category, was €29 billion in 2016. This puts B&M above categories such as breakfast cereals (estimated at €25 billion), savory biscuits (€22 billion) and pasta (€21 billion). The category’s products have been mostly associated with spreading, baking and cooking occasions, with other markets such as leavened bread (used for spreading) and foodservice (which shifts emphasis away from home cooking and baking) influencing the dynamic of volume development. On the value side, pricing in the category is influenced by the commodity cycle for dairy (butter) and vegetable oils (margarine). FFG is the leader in the global B&M market. According to Euromonitor International, in 2016 it had a 17.7% market share (by value) in the markets in which it was present, making it the leading player in both developed and emerging markets, with 18.2% and 15.6% of these markets, respectively, on a retail sales value basis. The markets in which FFG is present are set forth in the table entitled “FFG’s Key Markets” below. FFG’s value market share was four times larger than its next largest competitor, Arla (source: Euromonitor International, 2016). FFG estimates that, by volume, it had a market share of 23.0% globally (23.6% in developed markets and 20.6% in emerging markets), with the highest volume share, based on retail margarine volume ranking, in 44 markets, representing 89% of its turnover in 2016. Aside from Arla, FFG’s key branded competitors include Land O’Lakes, Lactalis, Bunge, Ornua and Conagra. For most of its global competitors, butter and margarine is a minor part of their portfolio. FFG considers private label margarine producers to be its key competitors in the markets in which it is present. According to Euromonitor International (Source: Euromonitor International, Packaged Food 2018 edition, data extracted February 2018), the market share (in total retail sales value) of private label margarine producers in the markets where we are present was 18.9% in 2016. 103 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

FFG believes that the key contributing factor was the decreasing number of occasions for baking, cooking and spreading. According to Euromonitor International, in FFG’s key markets (being the U.S.A., Germany, U.K. and Netherlands), leavened bread retail volume consumption decreased at a rate of 1% per annum during 2013 to 2016, thereby decreasing the number of spreading occasions. The decline in bread consumption has been amplified by a move from carbohydrate-based to protein-based diets. Consumers have also been switching to alternative spreads, such as chocolate spreads, mayonnaise and vegetable-based dips. According to data from Euromonitor International and GlobalData Plc., the consumption of alternative spreads has grown at a rate of 1% per annum from 2013 to 2016 across the U.S.A., Germany, U.K. and the Netherlands. Channel-wise, retail consumption has been slowing due to an overall shift towards foodservice and a corresponding decrease in cooking and baking occasions. According to Euromonitor International (Source: Euromonitor International, Retailing 2017 edition, Consumer Foodservice 2017 edition, data extracted June 2017), from 2012 to 2016, the average market value of foodservice spend (across the U.S.A., Germany, U.K. and Netherlands) grew at 3.8% per annum, faster than grocery retail sales, which grew 2.6% per annum during the same period.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

(2.2%) (1.9%) (4.2%) (3.1%) _Source: Company estimates based on Management Survey, Nielsen, Euromonitor International_ The trend in margarine consumption has also been exacerbated by the fact that butter has been perceived as more natural and functional, and has performed better than margarine in taste tests, due to its higher fat content. Until early January 2016, the declining butter price (in part driven by the removal of production quotas in the EU and the ban on milk and dairy imports in Russia, a significant dairy importer) had decreased butter’s price differential against margarine. These factors, together with emergence of spreadable butters (such as mélanges), has led to a decrease in the volume share of margarine within the butter and margarine market from 60.2% in 2013 to 55.7% in 2016, according to our estimates. This price trend, however, has since reversed due to a severe cut in dairy supply, driving up prices for butter in Europe. 104 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

For instance, in East Asia lactose intolerance is a common factor limiting the use of 106 ----- butter. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, in some East Asian Communities, up to 90% of adults are lactose-intolerant. Beyond that, FFG believes that in many African and Asian markets, margarine’s nutritional and health benefits (especially vitamin and Omega 3 and 6 content) have been a key consideration for consumers. According to the UNICEF/WHO/World Bank 2017 report “Levels and trends in Child Malnutrition”, malnutrition remains a key challenge for many children in emerging markets, creating substantial demand for affordable nutritious foods. Overall, FFG believes that the perception of margarine has been significantly more positive in emerging markets compared to developed markets, as evidenced by continued volume growth. According to the Management survey conducted in June 2017, in FFG’s key emerging markets, such as Indonesia and Mexico, its margarine products have experienced better or a very narrow gap in perception in relation to butter products. We believe that emerging markets offer ample headroom for growth, given significantly lower consumption rates, even where penetration is on par with developed markets. In our view, the driving factors of this growth are the continued increase in population, growth in leavened bread consumption (and concomitant increase in spreading occasions), growth in affluence, widening distribution capability and the adoption of localized approaches to foster margarine use cases (to be promoted, to a large extent, by FFG itself given its key position within the margarine category). Margarine, in particular, is well-positioned to exploit high price elasticity in relation to butter and a more positive consumer perception.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

In the Netherlands, where margarine consumption is among the highest in Europe, FFG is a clear leader in the wider B&M space, outpacing the entire private label segment. Aside from private label players, its key competitors in developed markets include Conagra and Pinnacle in the U.S.A.; Bunge, Arla and Friesland Campina in Germany; Dairy Crest and Arla in the U.K.; and Friesland Campina in the Netherlands. While margarine market shares have been generally stable or growing, in the wider butter and margarine space, FFG has seen a loss of market share to butter players over recent years for the reasons discussed above. In FFG’s key emerging markets, it commands an even greater market share in B&M categories when compared to developed markets. FFG’s branded product competition includes primarily local players, such as Indofood in Indonesia and Sigma Alimentos in Mexico, as well as sometimes including “copycat” brand manufacturers, as seen in some African countries. FFG’s market shares in the margarine category have generally been stable, though local competition has been intensifying in recent years. 107 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

DCAs are a fast growing sub-segment of the creams market, driven by increased consumer focus on dietary requirements. FFG believes that the top key product characteristics in creams are performance and functionality (i.e. ease-of-use of the package, product variety, whipping functionality, “binding and shifting” properties). Functionality is then followed by taste, price and brand. 108 ----- _Key FFG Markets Overview_ Creams accounted for 4% (€125.0 million) of FFG’s 2016 retail turnover. FFG’s largest creams markets in 2016 were Germany, the U.K. and Netherlands, with retail turnover of €41.3 million, €34.3 million and €10.6 million, respectively. FFG’s market shares in creams are significantly smaller than those in B&M, given less focus on this segment historically. We believe that FFG has significant scope to increase its market share as part of its current strategy, as well as the potential to roll out its offering to other markets. FFG believes that its DCA products offer significant performance benefits over competitors: creams do not curdle, are more stable to whipping, can be allergen free and have a longer shelf life. However, FFG recognizes that some competitors have more functional packaging and a wider range of stock keeping units, which therefore offers us a potential for even further improvement. _Germany_ The total sales value of the German creams market amounted to €815 million in 2016, after slight declines in the past (1.0% per annum from 2011 to 2016) driven by a decreasing number of cooking and baking occasions. According to Nielsen, the largest sub-segment of the German creams market in 2016 was whipping cream, which accounted for approximately 42% of the market, followed by ambient whipping cream and sour cream, accounting for 17% and 18%, respectively. In 2016, FFG had a market share of 4.2% of the total creams market in Germany (per FFG’s estimates), with approximately 73% of the cooking cream segment, and less than 5% market share in the whipping cream, crème fraiche, sour cream and other segments (source: Nielsen). While FFG does not currently offer ambient whipping cream and vegan creams, we believe there is significant upside to be gained through entering the ambient creams market and increasing FFG’s share in whipping creams. FFG is most active in the German creams market through its Rama Cremefine brand, which is positioned as an alternative to dairy creams and competes at a similar price point, but with addedvalue flavorings and functional benefits. _U.K._ According to Company’s estimates based on Euromonitor International, the creams market in the U.K. accounted for €0.3 billion in total sales value in 2016. The market is estimated to have grown by 3.6% per annum from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to slow to 0.1% from 2016-2022. FFG estimates that it accounted for 11% of the market in 2016, including with its Elmlea brand, positioned as a lower cost DCA. _Netherlands_ According to Company’s estimates based on Euromonitor International, the Dutch creams market accounted for €0.1 billion in total sales value in 2016. The market is estimated to have grown by approximately 1.6% per annum from 2011 to 2016, with the market expected to decline at 0.1% per annum until 2022. FFG believes that it accounted for no more than 11% of the market in 2016 with its Blue Band and Becel brands. Blue Band creams occupy a similar positioning to Rama Cremefine as a DCA, while Becel currently offers a range of non-core coffee creams.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.25,Distribution,18.25.1,,"FFG’s route to market is structured differently depending on the geography and channel. In line with the total retail market structure, almost all sales in the retail channel in developed markets are via modern retail supermarket chains. Apart from a few exceptions, distribution is completed by the retailer, with FFG only responsible for delivering the products to their distribution centers. In emerging markets, FFG tends to work with modern retailers directly, while traditional trade outlets are reached largely via different intermediaries, including cash and carries, wholesalers (who carry out distribution themselves), and other distribution partners. The overall global market of foodservice outlets is large, and includes approximately 20 million outlets globally based on a management exercise in 2014. This is comprised of various channels, including 111 ----- social (23%), restaurants (50%), cafes, pubs and bars (18%) and hotels and other (the remaining 9%). 72% of foodservice sales occur in independent outlets and 28% in chains. Within the chains, a large proportion of the outlets are franchises. Given that the majority of global outlets are independent, wholesalers and distributors play an important role in route-to-market and influencing end consumers. According to a management exercise conducted in 2014, direct sales to outlet chains only represented 13% of FFG’s foodservice turnover during that year, while the rest of its sales were effected through wholesalers.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

For example, the company estimates margarine volumes in the social and commercial channel decreased at 2% per annum during 2013 to 2016 in the U.S.A., U.K., Germany and the Netherlands, compared to a decrease of 7% per annum in the retail channel during the same period. Out-of-home dining spend grew by approximately 3% per annum from 2013 to 2016 according to Euromonitor International. The foodservice segment has less exposure to consumer factors. Foodservice products are typically used for cooking and baking, and therefore declining bread consumption has little impact on volumes. The trend towards natural products has less effect in back-of-house uses where functionality and reliability benefits are more important (for example, margarine makes spongier cakes and performs better than butter within quiches). The taste impact on final dishes is often limited, meaning less substitution towards butter. The company believes that social and commercial foodservice spend will continue to grow and is expected to outperform retail as a channel by 1% from 2016 to 2020 within the U.S.A., U.K., Germany and the Netherlands, with lower exposure to consumer factors providing a further 5% uplift for margarine volumes. Overall, the company expects B&M in foodservice (including industrial and artisanal volumes) will continue to grow at 1.7% per annum from 2016 to 2022, and creams in foodservice are expected to grow at 1.1% per annum during the same period, based on market data from Euromonitor International, GlobalData Plc. and wholesale sales data. The foodservice market consists of three sub-segments: social and commercial, artisanal and industrial. The social and commercial sub-segment accounts for 34% of total estimated foodservice market volumes for B&M and includes servicing cafes, restaurants, canteens, hotels. The industrial sub-segment includes industrial baking and deep frying, as well as sandwich manufacturing. Management have only sized the industrial baking portion of this, which makes up 49% of the estimated market. There is therefore a further opportunity beyond the sized market, for example in deep frying which is currently dominated by oil products but can be served by margarine. The remaining 16% of the estimated foodservice market is in the artisanal sub-segment, which serves small-scale bakeries. FFG currently only operates in the social and commercial sub-segment, with upside potential for penetrating into other sub-segments of the foodservice market. FFG believes that key consumer criteria in the social sub-segment are low price (due to the need to offer affordable dishes) and ease of use (particularly for inexperienced and lower-skilled chefs). In the commercial sub-segment, key product characteristics are quality, taste and price, as well as functionality (ease and efficiency of use) and reliability. 110 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Within this channel, FFG’s products are sold in 50 countries, with Indonesia, the U.K. and Switzerland being the largest markets (representing €35 million, €31 million and €21 million in turnover, respectively). The overall foodservice market across FFG’s product categories is highly fragmented, and it competes against multiple regional and national players. FFG believes that the only other global player in branded margarine is Bunge, but also believes that Vandemoortele is a major competitor, with approximately 30% market share in margarine in the Netherlands and approximately 20% in Germany. However, Vandemoortele is only active within Europe, with its primary focus on the artisanal sub-segment. Major regional players in branded margarine tend to have significant foodservice divisions. For instance, over 20% of ConAgra’s revenue is derived from foodservice. Based on chef and foodservice sales team interviews, FFG’s foodservice customers rate FFG particularly highly when compared to alternatives on dimensions of functionality and reliability, as well as underlying brand strength. FFG has historically positioned its products at a premium to those of its competitors. FFG believes that its combination of well-known brands and value-added services provided to foodservice operators (including organized staff training and product instruction, sharing recipes, etc.) justifies such positioning and pricing levels. Based on management data, FFG holds significant market shares in several key markets, in the channels in which it operates (44% in Indonesia, 45% in the U.K. and 50% in Germany). Historically, Unilever considered foodservice to be dilutive to margins, and therefore had limited focus on the channel. This has manifested in a number of ways, including limited outlet selection (e.g. fewer bakers), lower brand and marketing investment, lack of focus of sales teams and limited research and development investments. Therefore, management believes there is significant potential to grow within FFG’s existing markets, as well as to expand into new markets.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The FFG business was one of the earliest large-scale producers of margarine and many of its current brands, including Blue Band in the Netherlands and Rama in Germany enjoy heritage spanning almost a century. FFG’s Becel margarine was introduced in response to some of the first studies showing the impact of polyunsaturated fats on lowering cholesterol levels. The FFG business continued to develop technology to reduce the levels of saturated fats and improve the nutritional profile of its products throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the 2000s, the FFG business was one of the first major food producers to eliminate all trans fatty acids from its products.

Each lead country contains at least one manufacturing site and has additional back office support capabilities to service the needs of the other countries in the business unit, including with respect to human resources and IT. Lead countries will also take greater responsibility for customer development and marketing strategy within the business units. In addition to the lead country, business units will be made up of direct sales countries, which will be led by a country manager.

Across its core developed markets, FFG has very strong market positioning, with a share of the margarine segment greater than 50% in the U.S.A (59%), Germany (63%), the U.K. (57%) and the Netherlands (74%) in the year ended December 31, 2016, based on retail sales value. With a history of manufacturing and distributing category-leading products for nearly 150 years, FFG has an established global position with demonstrable brand recognition and customer loyalty. FFG has seven brands with a turnover of at least €175 million. These brands are Becel (2017 turnover: €327 million), Rama (2017 turnover: €321 million), Blue Band (2017 turnover: €254 million), Country Crock (2017 turnover: €242 million), Flora (2017 turnover: €208 million), I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! (2017 turnover: €197 million) and ProActiv (2017 turnover: €175 million). FFG’s portfolio benefits from strong brand equity, enjoying an average aided brand awareness of approximately 89% (in 2016), according to Millward Brown, making them some of the most recognizable packaged food brands in their respective markets. FFG’s brand range targets specific and distinct sub-categories within the B&M segment, such as family nutrition, heart health, cholesterol lowering, taste, cooking & baking, and value. The comprehensive range offered means that FFG caters for specific consumption across all main use occasions (spreading, cooking and baking), formats (wrappers, tubs and liquids) and storing conditions (chilled, ambient and tropical ambient products). 114 ----- The table below illustrates FFG’s largest brands by share of 2017 turnover:",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) hereby agrees (and is irrevocably authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Party) that it shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent) promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any Security Document) as is requested by the Parent in order to complete, implement or facilitate a Permitted Transaction. In the event that the Parent makes any request pursuant to and in reliance on the preceding sentence, the Security Agent shall be permitted to request a confirmation from the Parent that the relevant transaction, matter or other step is a Permitted Transaction and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents. If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of the Senior Liabilities then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Finance Documents and such application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any right of any member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document. The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request and at the cost of the Parent): (i) release the security; and (ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities, undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents, on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent). 177 ----- _Distressed Disposals_ Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is (a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being effected by enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s) or (c) being disposed of to a third party subsequent to a distress event. If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor): (i) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable; (ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release: (A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities; (B) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets; and (C) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor representatives; (iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to release: (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities; (B) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets; and (C) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company, on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor representatives; (iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company: (A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of: all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors; (v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with 178 ----- the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to: (A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and (B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be transferred. The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of constituted charged property), as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the relevant security interest and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred. In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price). Where Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities transferred to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities. Subject to the immediately following two paragraphs, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected by or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate or where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction). If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities will be released or disposed of, or any security securing the Second Lien Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either: (a) each Second Lien Agent has approved the release; or (b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor are sold: (i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and (ii) all claims of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any) all of whose shares 179 ----- (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates) and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that if each of the Senior Facility Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee and any Senior Creditor Representative (acting reasonably and in good faith): (A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not released and discharged; and (B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and (iii) such sale or disposal is made: (A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate; or (B) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction). If prior to the first date on which the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted Parent Financing Debt has occurred, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or any security over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be released and/or the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either: - the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative has approved the release; or - where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of the Senior Parent Debt Issuer are sold: (A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); (B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security interests under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good faith): (I) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released or discharged; and (II) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and (C) such sale or disposal is made: (I) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to participate; or 180 ----- (II) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Subject to 193 ----- the Agreed Security Principles, it is intended that, within 120 days of the Completion Date, the Notes will also be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the following additional guarantors (each entity that grants such a guarantee, an “Additional Guarantor,” and the Initial Guarantors and the Additional Guarantors together, the “Guarantors”). Each guarantee granted under the Indenture by a Guarantor is referred to herein as a “Guarantee.” The Initial Guarantors will be Sigma Midco B.V, Sigma Bidco B.V., Sigma US LLC and Sigma US Corp. The Additional Guarantors are anticipated to be each Restricted Subsidiary located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany or The Netherlands which is above a materiality threshold included in the Senior Facilities Agreement (based on 5% of the EBITDA of the consolidated group). See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing _Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.”_ The Guarantors will grant the Guarantees and will also grant a senior guarantee of the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional _Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each_ Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that guarantees the Senior Facilities Agreement shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. Therefore the Notes will indirectly benefit from the minimum guarantor provisions set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, as amended or restated from time to time. See “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.”_ The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, regulatory requirements or restrictions, financial assistance laws, corporate benefit laws, liquidity protection rules, fraudulent preference, “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the _Collateral—Each Guarantee and the security interests will be subject to significant limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries and effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes.”_ Under the Indenture, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon: - a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of ownership interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case, otherwise permitted by the Indenture; - the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; - defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and _Discharge;”_ - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Facilities Agreement; - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (defined below); - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;” - with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants— _Merger and Consolidation—Guarantors” and the Indenture; or_ 194 ----- - with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Company or a Guarantor. Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of certain documents from the Company or the relevant Guarantor, will execute any documents delivered to it by the Company in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Company, the Trustee nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination. Substantially all the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors, including the Holders. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Company. On a pro forma basis, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s business in the Target Guarantor markets accounted for 43% of its turnover, 46% of its Normalized EBITDA and 47% of its consolidated total assets, excluding goodwill, intangible assets, investments, deferred taxes and inter-company assets. Only certain subsidiaries organized or incorporated in the Netherlands, Germany, New York, Delaware and England will guarantee the obligations under the Notes. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under their Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Guarantees, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the Issue Date. In addition, the Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. The Guarantees will also be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including payment blockage and standstill on enforcement upon a senior default.

All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens. The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and hedging agreements and may secure additional Indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations and certain future Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and permitted to be secured on the Collateral (see “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”) will receive priority over the holders of the Notes with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Company’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The insolvency laws of _the Netherlands or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of the Guarantors may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes.”_ In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted under applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Company’s obligation under the Notes and a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See 196 ----- “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Guarantee and _security interests in the Collateral will be subject to significant limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Company, the Guarantors and any other Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes, the payment of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.”_ The Trustee for the Notes on the Issue Date will have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements_ entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness.

In the case of redemption as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of the Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of a Successor Company or the predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any 203 ----- notice of redemption of any Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been complied with or satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Company or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Company is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or in which it has a permanent establishment, or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor makes any payment on the Notes or any Guarantees, and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.

The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Trustee and each Paying Agent may rely on the fact that any officers’ certificate contemplated by this paragraph has not been furnished as evidence of the fact that no withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes is required. Wherever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. 205 ----- The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other property or similar taxes, charges or levies, that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in connection with a transfer or exchange of the Notes), excluding any such Taxes, charges or levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, and the Company agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders.

Unless the Company has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior to the purchase date) (the “Change of _Control Payment”);_ (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Company, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Company will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Company in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Company; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Company. 206 ----- If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes) or $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Dollar Notes). If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Company will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Company to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” expressly permits a third party to obtain control of the Company in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes validly tender and do not withdraw Notes of such series in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes have validly tendered and not withdrawn Notes of such series in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of such series, as applicable, Notes of such series owned by an affiliate of the Company or by funds controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of Change of Control Offer. The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which any Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a repurchase of any Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would require the repayment of such debt. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of 207 ----- their right to require the Company to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Company. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not have the _ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro _rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu_ Indebtedness.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of (i) the Euro Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) the Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the Company will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Company, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note, (i) in the case of Euro Notes, will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of Dollar Notes, will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Company to the Holder thereof.

Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to the Trustee against any losses, liabilities, fees or expenses which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against any losses, liabilities, fees or expenses; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover; and 232 ----- (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and written notice of such occurrence is received by a trust officer of the Trustee from the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors or trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

This summary deals only with Notes held as capital assets (within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) by U.S. holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes of the applicable series is sold for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler). As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors. This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: - a dealer in securities or currencies; - a financial institution; - a regulated investment company; - a real estate investment trust; - a tax-exempt organization; - an insurance company; - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle; - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities; - a person liable for alternative minimum tax; - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity); - a person whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or - a United States expatriate. This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a 284 ----- retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that are different from those discussed below.

Interest income on a Note will generally be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will generally be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable in euros, and interest on the Dollars Notes will be payable in U.S. dollars. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest received on the Euro Notes, determined by translating the amount of foreign currency received (if any) at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of the foreign currency so received). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the Euro Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the Euro Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Euro Note (including, upon the sale of a Euro Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the amount of foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment. 285 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be_ your cost for that Note. If you purchased a Note with foreign currency, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount of foreign currency paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros or U.S. dollars (as may be applicable), then your amount realized generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement or disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in euros or U.S. dollars (in the case of Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, respectively) on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the Note (with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, or the Guarantors is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or 290 ----- result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to have given the acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.” The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. 291 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

As such, they are subject to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which entered into force on June 26, 2015, and applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017. It has replaced Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 663/2014 of June 5, 2014 (the “Old EU Insolvency Regulation”). Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which has jurisdiction to open “main insolvency proceedings” in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any company or legal person has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its “centre of main interests.” The point at which a company’s “centre of main interest” is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The rebuttable presumption that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and if a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. The EU Insolvency Regulation has thereby basically implemented the existing case law of the European Court of Justice regarding the assessment of the place of the company’s centre of main interests into the text of the law. It has also, however, increased the requirements for a shift of the centre of main interest shortly prior to the filing for insolvency. In the event of a shift in the centre of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means). Where the centre of main interests of a company is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would 292 ----- be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized and given effect to (subject to some exceptions) in all the other Member States (other than Denmark), although “secondary proceedings” may be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark), in the circumstances described below. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open secondary proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. The courts of a Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” (before the opening of main insolvency proceedings) or “secondary proceedings” (after the opening of main insolvency proceedings) only in the event that a debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State (not being the Member State in which such debtor has its centre of main interest). The effects of “territorial proceedings” or “secondary proceedings” shall be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the Member State where such proceedings are opened. The determination of whether a company has an “establishment” and where it is situated is also a question of fact and is not a static concept. As such, an establishment could be created and may change from time to time. According to Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, an “establishment” means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. A “place of operations” is likely to be construed as a place from which economic activities are conducted on the market using human resources which requires a minimum level of organisation so that a purely occasional place of operations is unlikely to be classified as an “establishment”, rather a certain level of stability of such operations is necessary. In its judgment dated October 20, 2011 (“Interedil”), rendered under the Old EU Insolvency Regulation, the European Court of Justice confirmed that the creation of an “establishment” within the meaning of the Old EU Insolvency Regulation requires the existence of a structure which is designated for the performance of business activities with a minimum level of organisation and a certain degree of stability. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries or a Guarantor experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of, and the security granted by, the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries and/or any Guarantor. The insolvency and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or (subject to the framework provided for under the EU Insolvency Regulation) conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum to decide on the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union. The United Kingdom vote was to leave the European Union. The terms on which the United Kingdom will exit the European Union are not certain and therefore it is not possible to know what impact any exit by the United Kingdom of the European Union will have on the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation to any insolvency proceedings (including, without limitation, the commencement of such insolvency proceedings and the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom courts to open such insolvency proceedings) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor may be subject.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

This is particularly relevant for the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors, which have their corporate seats (statutaire zetel) in The Netherlands, and are therefore each presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have their “centre of main interests” in The Netherlands. 293 ----- Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities: the first, suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set forth below. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, in which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to exercise remedies against the debtor without court approval, in suspension of payments and bankruptcy proceedings under Dutch law, secured creditors (and in case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) may enforce their rights against assets of the company to satisfy their claims as if there were no insolvency proceedings. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. Consequently, your potential recovery could be reduced in Dutch insolvency proceedings. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months, may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Also, in this case, the secured creditor will have to wait until the distribution plan becomes final for payment. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although it may be subject to clawback in the event of a fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off. Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension of payments is granted and terminated by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. In a suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a simple majority of the creditors being present or represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the Dutch courts. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes. Claims against a company subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, that the value of the claim is determined and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the insolvency proceedings. The valuation of claims that would not otherwise have been payable at the time of the proceedings may be based on a net present value analysis. Unless secured by a pledge or a mortgage, interest accruing after the date on which insolvency proceedings are opened cannot be verified. Where interest is accruing after the date of opening of the proceedings, it can be admitted pro _memoria._ The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in the Dutch insolvency proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the receiver in bankruptcy, the administrator in suspension of payment 294 ----- proceedings, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure) in bankruptcy, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These situations could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes. _Renvooi procedures could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed compared to_ holders of undisputed claims. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination will generally be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings, with the actual effect largely depending on the way such subordination is construed.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Other general_ defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided on grounds of abuse of circumstances (misbruik van omstandigheden), deceit (bedrog), intimidation (bedreiging) or mistake (dwaling), the right to set off (verrekening) and the right to suspend performance (opschortingsrecht) or dissolve (ontbinding) a contract if the other party is in default in respect of its obligations. The validity, binding effect and enforceability of a guarantee may also be successfully contested by a Dutch company (or its receiver in bankruptcy or administrator in a suspension of payments) on the basis of an ultra vires claim. Such a claim will be successful if (i) the granting of a guarantee is ultra _vires (i.e. exceeds the scope the entity’s objects or is not in the entity’s corporate interest) and (ii) the_ counterparty of such Dutch company under the relevant guarantee knew or should have known (without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether the granting of such guarantee is ultra vires, the Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but all relevant circumstances including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee was granted. If and to the extent that it is determined that there is an imbalance, to the disadvantage of the company, between the value of the 295 ----- commercial benefit and the amount for which the company is held liable, then irrespective of the wording of the objects clause in its articles of association the company (and any bankruptcy receiver or administrator in suspension of payments) may contest the validity or enforceability of the act and it is possible that such contestation will be honored by the Dutch courts. Benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee, the continuity of such company would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee. It remains possible that even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it appears that the granting of the guarantee cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s objects. The foregoing applies mutatis mutandis to the acceptance of joint and several liability for, or providing or agreeing to provide security for, obligations of a third party, whether or not affiliated, and any other legal act having similar effect. In connection with the removal of the prohibition on financial assistance for Dutch private companies with limited liability as per October 1, 2012, it was mentioned in Dutch Parliament that the granting of security, providing of a guarantee or accepting of liability with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra vires act. At present, there is no Dutch case law on this subject. A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or who are entitled to an amount in shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or such lesser amount as is provided by the articles of association of such company.

Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully challenged by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the German Guarantors or any other German provider of collateral based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the holders of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code. In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, you may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the collateral. If payments have already been made under the Notes or collateral, the insolvency administrator may require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be challenged pursuant to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases: - any legal act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be challenged if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when due, and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively (zwingend) suggested such illiquidity or filing); - any legal act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be challenged if the transaction was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; if the transaction was effected in the second and third month prior to the filing, it can be challenged if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was illiquid or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the debtor; - any legal transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the debtor can be challenged if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the time of the legal transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge thereof or of the debtor being illiquid; 300 ----- - if a legal act whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt is regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be challenged unless it was effected earlier than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any legal act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after such filing can be challenged if the debtor acted with the intent to disadvantage its creditors and the beneficiary of the transaction had knowledge of such intent at the time of the transaction, with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors—such period of time is four years in the event that the relevant legal act provided security or satisfaction of the relevant creditor; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘affiliated party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any legal act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be challenged (i) in the event it provided security, if the transaction was effected within the last ten years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter or (ii) in the event it provided satisfaction, if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or - any legal act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party can be challenged if the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)). In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a subsidiary subject to the German insolvency laws) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the legal act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage the insolvency creditors if such person was aware of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged the debtor’s creditors. Under German law, a creditor who provided additional or extended existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator challenging transactions pursuant to the German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also avoid any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right pursuant to the German Act on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal 301 ----- insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the hardening periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. If any Guarantee is challenged or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantee and would have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining Guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. Moreover, please note that pursuant to the amendments (“Gesetz _zur_ _Verbesserung_ _der _Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz vom 29. März 2017”) of the German Insolvency Code that came into force on 5 April 2017, among other_ things, the provisions for avoidance claims in connection with willful intent, for cash transactions (Bargeschäfte) and the interest rates on avoidance claims have been amended. Finally, the insolvency estate serves to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims are satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and in accordance with the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a loan replacing equity capital or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.5,Germany Insolvency,256.5.2,"Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral, the Guarantees and the Security Interests","The security interests of the Security Agent may also be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of ownership interests and pledges may be subject to certain specific requirements, and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may be unable to obtain any such consent. The same applies in the context of any consent required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, the guarantees and security interests may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement or may be limited by applicable law or may be subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity or enforceability. Under German mandatory law, the granting and enforcement of security and/or guarantees which secure indebtedness of a direct or indirect shareholder or sister company of a security grantor incorporated in Germany or of a subsidiary of any such shareholder or sister company in order to ensure the maintenance of share capital of a joint stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft), limited liability company (Gesellschaft _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung)_ or a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a limited liability company as general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) is subject to certain statutory capital maintenance limitations. As a general rule, the capital maintenance rules prohibit the direct and indirect repayment (such term to include payments pursuant to guarantees or security in favor of obligations of a direct or indirect shareholder) of registered share capital of a German limited liability company to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of its net assets (i.e. assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). As a consequence, customary provisions will be included in, among others, the Indenture (so-called “limitation language”) which, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions, limit the enforceability of the respective guarantees and corresponding security interests addressing these statutory limitations and liability risks pursuant to section 43 para. 3 German Limited Liability Companies Act (Gesetz _betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) or section 93 para. 3 no. 6 German Stock_ Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz). This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted by a German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. 302 ----- Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the jurisprudence of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer should, as of the date thereof, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German Guarantor, the enforcement limitations agreed in the Indenture also contain certain provisions limiting an enforcement in connection with a potential liquidity shortfall of the relevant German Guarantor. This may further limit (or exclude entirely) the ability to enforce the respective Guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Guarantor. German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to evolving jurisprudence. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of German (direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuer to make payment on Guarantees or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees. Finally, there is no legal precedent whether or not the contractual provisions limiting the enforcement of the guarantee or security interests, including the adjustments of certain balance sheet items (as provided for in the Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement) or similar provisions will be held by a German court to be in compliance with the statutory capital maintenance rules. With respect to accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheit) expressed to be governed by German law (such as pledges over shares, partnership interests, receivables or bank accounts), due to certain legal requirements governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests it is imperative that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim is the same person. Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does not itself hold the secured claim. Even more, such accessory security is dependent on the secured obligations and will automatically lapse upon payment, settlement or novation (Novation) of the secured obligations. In order to overcome these legal obstacles in relation to German law accessory security the Collateral secures a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or, as applicable, the obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or, as applicable, the relevant Guarantor under its Guarantee (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt owed to the Security Agent only rather than the obligations owed under the Notes or to the holders of the Notes directly. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt under the Intercreditor Agreement, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full amount payable on the Notes or, as applicable, the relevant Guarantee, the parallel debt construct has not yet been tested in German courts, and we cannot assure you that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of the security interest. Similar concerns would apply for any future pledgee concept included in the relvant pledge agreement. If any challenge to the validity of such security interest or the parallel debt structure were successful, holders of the Notes might not be able to recover any amounts in respect of such security interests. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. Furthermore, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral. Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security purposes must not be excessive. Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (nachträgliche 303 ----- _Übersicherung) (where the value of the relevant security interest subsequently significantly and not_ only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security interests can even be deemed void in case of an initial excessive over-collateralization (anfängliche Übersicherung). As a general rule, the value of collateral should not exceed the amount of the secured obligations by more than 50%. A security transfer or assignment violating this rule either in itself or in combination with other security interests will be deemed void if the violation exists at the time the collateral is granted. If the ratio is exceeded later as a result of partial prepayment or of progressing repayment of the secured obligations, the security grantor is entitled to a corresponding ratable release of the collateral. There is no clear authority as to how the ratio has to be applied in the context of a financing involving several companies and to what extent accessory forms of collateral (i.e., account pledges, claim pledges and share or interest pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be taken into account. While the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case-by-case basis, some legal authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization is given if the realization value of the security exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims. Furthermore, under conflict of laws rules, the enforceability of an assignment against the obligor of the assigned right will typically be governed by the law applicable to the assigned right. As long as the obligor of an assigned claim is not aware of the assignment, such third-party debtor is entitled to assume that the assignor is still the creditor (e.g. the claim will extinguish if and to the extent that the debtor pays the assignor with discharging effect). Moreover, the assignability of a claim governed by German law may be limited because of the nature of the assigned claim or as a result of an agreement between the creditor and the obligor thereof. Although pursuant to section 354a of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) a contractual agreement cannot validly preclude an assignment if the assigned claim results from a transaction entered into between two commercial parties, any payment with discharging effect on such claim to the assignor will extinguish such claim in a corresponding amount. German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors). Finally, the provision of Guarantees and execution of the Collateral will be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or security providers of the obligation to provide guarantees and/or grant security interests in assets otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could have a material adverse impact on the credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The German Guarantors and all other German providers of collateral organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. Therefore, insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Guarantors and all other German providers of collateral may be initiated in Germany if the German Guarantors or any of the other German providers of collateral, respectively, were held to have their “centre of main interests” within the territory of Germany at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed. German law would then govern those proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the “centre of main interests” of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over German Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency and administrative laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. 296 ----- Under German insolvency law, there is to date no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within FFG. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and also no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German legislature passed an act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von _Konzerninsolvenzen), which will come into force on April 21, 2018. This act mainly provides for_ coordination and cooperation in connection with insolvency proceedings of group companies. This act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), and, in addition, by the debtor on a voluntary basis in the case of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Pursuant to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder, such as the German Guarantors, finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such company and, in certain circumstances its shareholders, are obligated to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay which may be deemed to be necessary no later than three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness objectively occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations potentially exposes the management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company_ currently is able to service its payments obligations when they fall due, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. However, only the debtor, and not the creditors, is entitled (but not obligated) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings due to imminent illiquidity. The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator depend on the decision of the court and may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s property (which includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Upon appointment of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency court may also order that the debtor can only dispose over its assets with the consent of the preliminary insolvency administrator or the court may order that the power to dispose over the assets shall fully pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor. 297 ----- As an alternative to preliminary proceedings, a debtor may petition for a debtor-in-possession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—with such decision being subject to, _inter_ _alia,_ the requirement that such debtor-in-possession proceeding is not obviously futile. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and the number of its employees, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger _Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on the profile of the officeholder to be appointed or even to make_ a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). The preliminary creditors’ committee also has the power to, _inter_ _alia,_ influence orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung) and appointments for preliminary trustees (Sachwalter). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes _Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover_ at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels _Masse)._ Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court, unless a debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor-in-possession process, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any movable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g. liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment 298 ----- agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in their statutory aggregate, add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any) (unless the insolvency administrator successfully asserts higher enforcement costs or the creditors can prove lower enforcement costs), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds resulting from the disposal of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors (including the unsecured claims of the holder of the Notes) of the Issuer, the German Guarantors or any other German provider of collateral in full. In addition, it may take several years until such proceeds from the insolvency estate (if any) are distributed to unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of the debtor can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g. these can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion. Under certain conditions, the debtor may also file for protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Given the relatively recent enactment of these amendments, these provisions may not have been tested in practice and no judicial precedents are available in such respect. If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession proceeding and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) the court may grant a period of up to three months to utilize an insolvency plan for the debtor’s business. During this period, creditors’ rights to enforce security may, upon petition of the filing debtor, be suspended. In these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or not impartial). Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors, provided they qualify as liabilities of the estate itself (Masseverbindlichkeiten). Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrators opt for performance. 299 ----- Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement upon the filing for or opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte _oder Lösungsklauseln) are generally invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency_ administrator (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also apply to agreements that are not governed by German law.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Accordingly, an English court may conclude that the UK Guarantors have their “centre of main interests”, within the meaning of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, in England and, therefore, that insolvency proceedings in England constituting “main insolvency proceedings” under Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in respect of a UK Guarantor. In the event that a UK Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales (“UK Insolvency Proceedings”) may be initiated in a number of ways, including by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application to court for entry into administration, (ii) the company, its directors, or certain creditors (discussed below) appointing administrators out of court, or (iii) a creditor filing a petition to wind-up the company or the company resolving to wind itself up (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes (as described below). 304 ----- Under the Insolvency Act 1986 as amended (the “UK Insolvency Act”), a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (i.e. it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (i.e. it is provided to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or, among other matters, if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order).

Where there are floating charges, liquidation expenses (discussed further below), preferential creditors, and unsecured creditors to the extent of the “ring-fenced” fund (also discussed further below) may (to the extent the other unsecured assets of the UK Guarantor are insufficient to discharge them) be paid out of the proceeds of realization of assets subject to those floating charges in priority to payments to creditors secured by virtue of those floating charges. Thereafter, any debts owing to holders of the floating charges would be paid to the extent they are secured by that charge. The categories of preferential debts include certain amounts payable in respect of occupational pension schemes relating to contributions due but unpaid and employee remuneration up to a specified amount. A certain part of the net proceeds of the realization of the assets covered by a floating charge (up to a maximum of £600,000) would be “ring-fenced” and made available pro rata to unsecured creditors.

A company may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the application of, among others, the company itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the company also has the right to appoint an administrator. In addition, he has the right to intervene in an application made for administration proceeding by another person by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver. An administrator may only be appointed (either by a court or via the out-of court process) if there is sufficient evidence (which varies depending on the method of appointment) including that (a) the 305 ----- company proposed to be the subject of the administration is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of the statutory objectives of administration. Administration proceedings are supposed to achieve one of three objectives that must be considered successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than if the company went into immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to secured or preferential creditors. Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order (in the case of a court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (in the case of an out of court appointment) is made. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a full statutory moratorium applies, pursuant to which no creditor can take any action against that company, including, among other things, commencing a legal process against the company, winding up the company or enforcing security or repossessing goods in the company’s possession under a hire purchase or similar agreement, without the permission of the court or (in the case of a full moratorium) the consent of the administrator. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. Subject to the above points, were a UK Guarantor to enter administration, whilst any principal debt or guarantee obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action could be taken in respect of any failure to pay.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

In particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims. Where a corporate rescue is not possible, administration can be used as a proceeding in which to make distributions to creditors like a liquidation in which case claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval (and the conversion of the administration from a rescue proceeding to a liquidating administration) will generally be required before he can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be set for receipt and processing of claims before interim dividends are paid. As with liquidation, as described above, where an administration moves into the liquidation phase, an administrator will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of a floating charge security (if any) for the benefit of unsecured creditors up to a maximum of £600,000 (and after making full provision for preferential creditors and administration expenses out of those floating charge realizations).",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes to purchasers at the price to investors indicated on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may from time to time vary the offering price and other selling terms without notice. To the extent that any of the Initial Purchasers are not U.S.-registered broker dealers, they will only offer and sell Notes in the United States through U.S.-registered broker dealers or affiliates, as appropriate. In addition, the Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes outside the U.S. through certain of their affiliates. The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments which the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain expenses of the offering of the Notes. The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that have a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes) during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial Purchasers. No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes and the Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes or the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.

See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_ The Stabilization Manager may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Stabilization Manager. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Stabilization Manager of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering of the Notes. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes while the offering of the Notes is in progress. These activities by the Stabilization Manager, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes, and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold except (i) to QIBs in offers and sales that occur within the United States, in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A; and (ii) in offers and sales that occur outside the United States, in reliance on Regulation S, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state or territory of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any of the Notes (including the Guarantees) as part of its allocation at any time other than to QIBs in the United States in accordance with Rule 144A or outside of the United States in accordance with Regulation S. Transfer of the Notes (including the Guarantees) will be restricted and each purchaser of the Notes (including the Guarantees) in the United States will be required to make certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements, as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it: - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and - any Notes will only be offered in the Netherlands to qualified investors (as defined in the Prospectus Directive), unless such offer is made in accordance with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht). 311 ----- Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker-dealers registered under the Exchange Act. The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which is ten business days following the date of this Offering Memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven successive business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle ten business days following the date of pricing of the Notes, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Issuer and its affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and have provided commitments under the bridge facility that the Issuer has entered into as borrower to provide financing for the Acquisition in the event the Offering is not consummated, and such entities may act as counterparties in the hedging arrangements the Issuer expects to enter into in connection with the Transactions, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Funds advised by KKR that indirectly own an equity interest in the Issuer are affiliates of KKR Capital Markets Limited, which is acting as an Initial Purchaser in connection with the offering of the Notes. KKR Capital Markets Limited may therefore be deemed to be our affiliate and have a conflict of interest with us. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 312 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts. The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally acceptable ground, and (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

However, under current rules as presently applied by German courts, a final and conclusive judgment by a U.S. court for a definite sum of money, will be recognized and thereby given binding effect within the territory of Germany, unless the German court finds that, inter alia, the recognition of the U.S. judgment leads to a result manifestly irreconcilable with material principles of German law or that proper legal procedures have not been observed. Specifically, the recognition and enforcement of the U.S. judgment by a German court is to be denied if one or more of the following circumstances exist: - U.S. courts would not have had jurisdiction over the case based on the principles on jurisdictional competences under German law; or 323 ----- - the defendant did not appear in the proceedings and invokes such lack of appearance, and the document introducing the proceedings was not duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; or - the judgment conflicts with (i) any prior judgment rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment rendered by another foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; or (iii) the proceedings leading to such foreign judgment are irreconcilable with previously pending proceedings in a German court; or - the recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court would be in conflict with German public policy, including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); or - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is not guaranteed. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities, such as the holders of the Notes, may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium, as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally. It should be noted that German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. As far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may compel the extensive production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses prior to trial. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. If the party in whose favor a final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment inconsistent with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
657_5,Offerings 2018.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.3,England and Wales,145.3.1,,"The United States and the United Kingdom do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the United Kingdom are both parties to the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards). Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly enforceable in England and Wales and is subject to the common law rules of enforcement. In order to enforce any such judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In this type of action, an English court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court and/or enforce a judgment, provided that: - the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction (under English rules of private international law) to give the judgment or the judgment is not final or conclusive; - the original judgment is final and conclusive on the merits of the claim and is for a definite sum of money (and is not payable in respect of a tax, fine or penalty); - the enforcement of such judgment would not contravene public policy, a statute in England or the European Convention on Human Rights; 324 ----- - the original judgment is not for multiple damages; - the original judgment is not inconsistent with a prior judgment on the same subject matter and between the same parties; - the English proceedings were commenced within the relevant limitation period; - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question were not the subject of a judgment of an English court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in England; - the original judgment has been not obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice were breached; - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was not contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit), for example by way of arbitration or proceedings in a different court; - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was not contrary to an agreement that any dispute would be settled by reference to a different governing law than applied by the U.S. court; - no order has been made that remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 applying that section to U.S. courts including the relevant U.S. court; and - no relevant power has been exercised by the United Kingdom Government pursuant to section 5(4) of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980. If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will create an obligation which can be enforced as a debt in fresh legal proceedings. It may be necessary to serve the proceedings out of the jurisdiction, and parties must consider whether it is necessary to obtain the permission of the court to do so. It may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in the manner described above. It is, however, uncertain whether an English court would impose liability on FFG in an action predicated upon U.S. federal securities law brought in England and Wales. 325 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

(b) In 2015 aspects of the Spreads Business were restructured into a newly created Baking, Cooking and Spreads (‘BCS’) group of legal entities. The restructuring involved the transfer at fair value of Spreads related trade, assets and liabilities amounting to a total of € 2,612.1 million. In some countries BCS entities drew down loans from Unilever Finance International AG amounting to a total of € 1,289.9 million to satisfy the purchase of Spreads net assets. In other countries the transfers of Spreads net assets to local BCS entities did not involve settlements in cash and were effected through other restructuring mechanisms as allowed under local regulations (e.g. demerger; share transfer or contribution; assets distributions). This restructuring had no impact on the BCS assets and liabilities reflected in these combined carve-out financial statements as they are reported at historical cost, except for the recognition of deferred tax balances arising from changes in certain underlying tax bases as discussed in note 6A. As at 31 December 2015, the related party loans with Unilever Finance International AG are recognised as financial liabilities (refer to note 19) and the cash remitted on restructuring to other legal entities within Unilever is disclosed as a movement in net parent (deficit)/ investment. (c) As Unilever uses a centralised approach to cash management and financing its operations, transactions between Unilever and the Spreads Business are accounted for through net parent (deficit) / investment. Accordingly none of the cash, cash equivalents, debt or related interest income and expense at the corporate level have been assigned to the Spreads Business, with the exception of cash, debt and related interest held by BCS legal entities. The Other transactions with F-7 ----- Unilever and non-controlling interests reflect the fact that the Spreads Business does not retain cash generated from operating activities and represents the cash outflow associated with repatriating such cash to Unilever, net of any movements in working capital, financing and investing activities. (d) On 1 July 2017 USCC AG transferred 100% of the profit rights relating to BCS to BCS Europe BV for consideration of € 523 million. This acquisition was funded by a € 523 million loan from Unilever Finance International AG. This loan transaction is shown as a cash inflow from additional related party loans with Unilever. The acquisition is shown as a cash outflow within other transactions with Unilever and owners of non-controlling interests. On 15 Nov 2017, UNUS Holdings BV injected € 523 million of capital into BCS Europe BV (via a number of Spreads intermediary holding companies) which was used to settle the loan with Unilever Finance International AG. No cash transferred as part of this transaction. F-8 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

An opening combined balance sheet as at 1 January 2015 has also been presented. These combined carve-out financial statements have been prepared in accordance with this basis of preparation, which is consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and as issued by the IASB, except as set out below: - IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as issued by the IASB do not provide for the preparation of combined carve-out financial statements and accordingly in preparing these combined carve-out F-10 ----- financial statements certain accounting conventions commonly used for the preparation of historical financial information for inclusion in investment circulars as described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standard applicable to public reporting engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board have been applied. Further details on the application of these accounting conventions can be found below. These combined carve-out financial statements: - Have been prepared by combining and carving-out the assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to the Spreads Business. Those amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the Unilever entities running Spreads activities, which also include recharges by Unilever of indirect central costs and general corporate expenses. The underlying financial records of Unilever are maintained in accordance with EU and IASB IFRS; - Include a cash flow statement showing movements arising from operating, investing and financing activities irrespective of Unilever’s centralised approach to cash management and financing; and - Disclose the cumulative investment of Unilever in the Spreads Business as net parent (deficit) / investment. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to the Spreads Business include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the Spreads Business, together with an allocation of the items that are not. The following estimates, judgements and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out financial statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. Balance sheet items: - Property, plant and equipment includes: - land and buildings related to factories and sites shared between the Spreads Business and other parts of Unilever only where those land and buildings (or share of those land and buildings) are transferring to KKR as part of the Transaction; - plant and machinery at the above sites where directly attributable to Spreads or, where shared, in proportion to its estimated use by the Spreads Business based on production cost ratios; and - plant and machinery at other sites that are not transferring to KKR where directly attributable to Spreads. - Where trade receivables held by Unilever relate to spreads and non-spreads products, Spreads trade receivables have been estimated in each country for the top 20 Spreads customers by applying the ratio of spreads sales over total sales to total receivables for each of those customers. The remaining balance has been estimated by applying the same ratio after excluding sales from those top 20 customers. - Where trade payables held by Unilever relate to spreads and non-spreads purchases, Spreads trade payables have been estimated using the proportion of the Spreads Business cost of sales and administrative expenses compared to total Unilever cost of sales and administrative expenses in each country. - Commodity and foreign exchange derivatives are held by Unilever and have been estimated as follows: - Commodity derivatives: in proportion to the commodities used by the Spreads Business; and - Foreign exchange derivatives: using the proportion of Spreads Business usage compared to total Unilever usage. - As Unilever uses a centralised approach to cash management and financing its operations, transactions between Unilever and the Spreads Business are accounted for through net parent (deficit) / investment. Accordingly, none of the cash, cash equivalents, debt or related interest income and expense at the corporate level have been assigned to the Spreads Business, with the exception of cash, debt and related interest held by BCS legal entities. F-11 ----- - Current tax balances in BCS legal entities form part of the Spreads Business’ current liabilities. Tax amounts allocated from the Unilever Group to Spreads activities operated outside of BCS legal entities (see income statement items below) have been reflected in the combined balance sheet as changes in net parent (deficit) / investment. - Intercompany receivables from, and payables to, other parts of Unilever that are supported by loan agreements have been presented as financial assets / liabilities; other balances have been presented as part of trade receivables / payables. Income statement items: - Operating costs reflect amortisation and depreciation charges relating to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment included in the combined carve-out balance sheet (see balance sheet items above), and an allocation of amortisation and depreciation charges for those software and buildings utilised by the Spreads Business but not included in the combined carve-out balance sheet (separately disclosed as “allocated” amortisation or depreciation in note 3). Allocated amortisation and depreciation have been estimated by reference to the proportion of Spreads revenue compared to total Unilever revenue. - Indirect central costs (primarily related to the sales force, general marketing and merchandising) and general corporate expenses (primarily related to finance, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, and audit) incurred by Unilever are systematically recharged to Spreads business units as management charges in accordance with Unilever’s historical internal methodology. These management charges are recharged by Unilever on the basis of direct usage when identifiable or based on as a proportion of revenue, adjusted on a line-by-line basis to reflect specific local circumstances, when not. These recharged costs and expenses: - are deemed to have been settled by the Spreads Business to Unilever in the period in which these costs were accrued; and - are influenced by the management and recharge arrangements that existed within the Unilever Group and are not necessarily representative of the future level of costs for the Spreads Business as it will exist upon completion of the Transaction. - The tax charge is a combination of the tax charges recorded in BCS legal entities and an allocation of the tax charges recorded in Unilever that are associated with Spreads operations not recorded within BCS legal entities. The allocation has been made using an effective tax rate that is appropriate to circumstances in each individual country. The tax charges recorded in the combined carve-out income statement may not be representative of the charges that may arise in the future. These combined carve-out financial statements apply consistently, unless otherwise stated, the accounting policies and the material estimates and judgements made that are disclosed in the accounting policies and in the critical accounting estimates and judgements sections below.

PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS For defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income statement. Ongoing operating cost in the income statement is the cost of one additional year of pension benefits promised to employees for defined benefit plans or contributions paid for defined contribution plans. In addition, there are also costs and/or credits arising from one-off events such as past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments. These one-off events are fully recognised as they occur in operating cost. The amount charged or credited to finance costs is broadly calculated by applying the liability interest rate to the defined benefit deficit or surplus at the year end. Any differences between the expected interest on assets and the actual return achieved by the pension fund, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in financial and demographic assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the combined carve-out statement of comprehensive income at the end of the year. Charges to the income statement which are shown in these accounts are split between (i) defined benefit pension and other benefit plans which will transfer (recorded on the combined carve-out balance sheet), and (ii) defined contribution, and defined benefit and other benefit plans which will not transfer (not recorded on the combined carve-out balance sheet). The finance cost shown in the income statement is only for the plans that will transfer. For defined benefit plans which will transfer with the Spreads Business as part of the Transaction, balance sheet surplus or deficit comprises the total of the market value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit liabilities. Liabilities relating to Unilever employees that are expected to transfer with the Spreads Business are calculated using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market. For defined benefit plans which will not transfer with the Spreads Business as part of the Transaction, no assets or liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet. The income statement charge includes dedicated pension charges for dedicated Spreads employees and an estimation based on revenue for other employees. Corporate pension charges have been allocated to the Spreads business. All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Spreads Business. For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the Spreads Business’ contributions payable in accordance with the plan rules in each country. The Spreads Business’ obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans. F-18 -----",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

MCIP share awards and GSIP share awards until 2015 are the same for all Unilever managers, GSIP share awards from 2016 are different for managers employed by BCS legal entities and other Unilever managers. The increased charge in 2017 is due to improved performance of the Spreads Business. The MCIP allows certain Unilever managers to invest up to 60% (up to 100% from 2017) of their annual bonus in shares in Unilever and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related shares. The awards vest after three years (four years from 2017) between 0% and 200% of grant level, depending on the satisfaction of performance metrics. The performance metrics are underlying sales growth, operating cash flow and core operating margin improvement (underlying operating margin improvement from 2017) for Unilever. There is an additional target based on relative total Unilever shareholder return (TSR) for senior executives. Under GSIP, certain Unilever managers receive annual awards of NV and PLC shares.

For this reason the rate may vary from year to year according to the mix of profit and related tax rates. The Spreads Business tax rate has been reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote economic development and investment. The tax rate has been increased by business expenses which are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense, and by charges for uncertain tax positions. ‘Other’ in 2015 primarily represents the impact of the creation of deferred tax assets arising from changes in the underlying tax bases of intellectual property and other intangible assets transferred at fair value on restructuring of the Spreads Business discussed in footnote (b) of the cash flow statement. F-22 ----- The Swiss/Dutch transfer relates to the creation of a new deferred tax asset arising on the transfer of the European supply chain business from Switzerland to the Netherlands on 1 July 2017. This involved the transfer of profit rights resulting in an intangible asset of € 523 million in BCS Europe BV. The intangible was created as a result of an intragroup transaction and gives rise to a tax base in the Dutch tax return. A deferred tax asset of € 131 million (€ 523 million at the Dutch tax rate of 25%) was recognised in the balance sheet on 1 July 2017. The balance as at 31 December 2017 is € 124 million. Refer to note (d) in the combined carve-out cash flow statement. Impact of US tax reform – On 22 December, HR1, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was signed into law in the United States. This resulted in a tax benefit of € 19.2 million, primarily due to a re-measurement of deferred tax asset and liabilities at the new tax rate of 21%. The Spreads Business’ future tax charge and effective tax rate will be affected by several factors, including changes in tax laws and their interpretation and still to be determined tax reform proposals in the EU and Switzerland, as well as the impact of acquisitions, disposals and the future legal structure of the Spreads Business. 6B. DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Spreads Business. Certain temporary differences are not provided for as follows: - the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and - differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the year end. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in net parent (deficit) / investment. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. The Spreads Business is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities. These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in future years. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice. € million** € million € million Tax charge in income statement** **2017** 2016 2015",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK Spreads Business’ size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use of financial instruments: - Commodity price risk The key commodities used by the Spreads Business are rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, palm stearin and palm kernel oil. Management aims to minimise the impact of commodity market volatility on (gross) margin and allow time to take corrective pricing action (‘pricing horizons’). Commodity hedging is undertaken based on 100% of the volume exposure around the pricing horizon, although hedging can be undertaken up to 52 weeks with approval and within limits. - Currency risk The Spreads Business is exposed to movements in the underlying currency of transacted commodity prices that are mainly denominated in USD. A layered hedging approach up to 12 months is used to hedge the foreign currency transaction exposure. Because of the Spreads Business’ global reach, it is also subject to the risk that changes in foreign currency rate impact the Spreads Business’ sales and purchases. F-35 ----- The above risks may affect the Spreads Business’ income and expenses, or the value of its financial instruments. The Spreads Business’ objective in managing market risk is to maintain it within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. Generally, the Spreads Business applies hedge accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk. The Spreads Business’ exposure to, and management by Unilever of, these risks is explained below. It often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 14C.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

No hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being recognised in the income statement. Unilever treasury department provides central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange management services for the Unilever Group’s operations, including those of the Spreads Business. The department is governed by standards and processes of the Unilever Group which are approved by the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE). In addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive independent reporting covers all major areas of activity. Performance of Unilever treasury department is monitored closely by senior management and reviews are undertaken periodically by corporate audit. Unilever treasury department’s activities in relation to the Spreads Business, are designed to: - protect the Spreads Business’ financial results and position from the financial risks mentioned below; - maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns (see note 14B); and - provide adequate and sufficient funding to the Spreads Business. Unilever treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments. The use of any new instrument must be approved by the Unilever Chief Financial Officer. The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted. The Spreads Business’ capital requirements have been centrally managed by Unilever, who has provided funding so as to safeguard the Spreads Business’ ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to Unilever. The Spreads Business is not subject to financial covenants in any of its significant financing agreements. The Spreads Business does not have its own credit rating. Unilever Group’s long-term credit rating is A+/A1 (February 2018) and short-term credit rating is A1/P1 (February 2018).

F-32 ----- The Spreads Business is exposed to the following financial risks that arise from its use of financial instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections: - liquidity risk (see note 14A); - market risk (see note 14B); and - credit risk (see note 15B). 14A. MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Spreads Business will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities. In conjunction with Unilever Treasury the Spreads Business’ approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses. The Spreads Business is reliant on Unilever Treasury to meet its obligations associated with its financial liabilities in both normal and stressed conditions. The financial liabilities of the Spreads Business at the balance sheet date are mainly loans payable to Unilever (note 14B) and trade payables (note 12) which are mostly short term in nature. The financial assets of the Spreads Business at the balance sheet date are mainly trade receivables (note 11) from reputable customers which are short term in nature. The Spreads Business has maintained a positive cash balance throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017. This was the result of cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from loans provided by the Unilever Group.

Unilever treasury uses commodity forward contracts to hedge against this risk in the Spreads Business. All commodity forward contracts hedge future purchases of raw materials and the contracts are settled either in cash or by physical delivery. Commodity derivatives are generally designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge accounting relations. All commodity forward contracts are done in line with approvals from the Global Commodity Executive which is chaired by the Chief Supply Chain Officer (CSCO) of the Unilever Group. Unilever treasury manages currency exposures in the Spreads Business within prescribed limits, mainly through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Operating companies manage foreign exchange exposures within prescribed limits. Local compliance is monitored centrally. The aim of the approach to management of currency risk is to leave the Spreads Business with no material residual risk. This aim has been achieved in all years presented.

CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Spreads Business if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Spreads Business’ trade receivables are short term in nature and largely comprise amounts receivable from reputable customers. Additional information in relation to credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 11. These risks are generally managed by local Unilever controllers. Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a total Unilever basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. To reduce this risk, Unilever has concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and past experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by Unilever’s treasury department. Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilever’s principal counter-parties. In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across transactions with that counter-party. Further details in relation to the Spreads Business’ exposure to credit risk are shown in note 11.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and a reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits. It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the future.

Unilever and the Spreads Business intends to robustly defend this claim and believe that the likelihood that it will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. We believe our position is strong and so the matter has not been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. There have been no changes to this assessment in 2017. On 12 March Unilever Elais Hellas S.A, a Unilever subsidiary in Greece, received a Statement of Objections from the Hellenic Competition Commission for alleged violations of competition law in the margarines sector from 1996 until today. Unilever and the Spreads business are still assessing the implications arising from what is a very complex case. We intend to defend these allegations robustly, though there are no guarantees of success and therefore the matter has not been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Due to the complex nature of the case, which is still under investigation, we are currently unable to assess the level of any potential fine. Should the allegations be upheld, the maximum fine which could be levied under Greek law is 10% of turnover, which for Unilever Elais Hellas S.A. would be approximately €40 million.",N/A,as_expected,2018,399
