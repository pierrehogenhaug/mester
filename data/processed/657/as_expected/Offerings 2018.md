SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND

LOCAL SECURITIES LAWS.

THE FOLLOWING PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM MAY NOT BE FORWARDED OR
DISTRIBUTED TO ANY OTHER PERSON AND MAY NOT BE REPRODUCED IN ANY MANNER
WHATSOEVER. ANY FORWARDING, DISTRIBUTION OR REPRODUCTION OF THIS DOCUMENT
IN WHOLE OR IN PART IS UNAUTHORIZED. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS DIRECTIVE MAY

_Confirmation of your representation: In order to be eligible to view the preliminary offering_
memorandum or make an investment decision with respect to the securities, you must be either (1) a
QIB or (2) outside the United States purchasing securities in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S, provided that investors in a Member State of the European Economic Area must not be a
retail investor. For the purposes of this provision the expression “retail investor” means a person who is
one (or more) of the following: (a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (b) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC
(as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II. The preliminary offering memorandum is being sent at your request. By
accessing the preliminary offering memorandum or accepting an e-mail with the preliminary offering
memorandum attached, you shall be deemed to have represented to the Issuer and the initial
purchasers named as such in the attached preliminary offering memorandum (the “Initial Purchasers”)
that:

(1) you consent to delivery of such preliminary offering memorandum by electronic transmission; and

(2) either:

(a) you and any customers you represent are QIBs; or

(b) the e-mail address that you gave the Issuer and to which the e-mail has been delivered is not
located, and will not be deemed to be located, in the United States, its territories and
possessions (including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake
Island and the Northern Mariana Islands), any State of the United States or the District of
Columbia.

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be relying
on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A.


-----

The notes described in this preliminary offering memorandum (the “Notes”) are not intended to be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in MiFID II; or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPS Regulation. This preliminary offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under
Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”) from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of notes. This preliminary offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Directive. No prospectus is required in accordance with the Prospectus
Directive for this issue of Notes.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the EEA
will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is not a retail investor. For the
purposes of this provision the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the
following: (a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (b) a customer within
the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates and others will rely upon the trust and accuracy of the foregoing representation,
acknowledgement and agreement.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

You are reminded that the preliminary offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis
that you are a person into whose possession the preliminary offering memorandum may be lawfully
delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located, and you may not, nor
are you authorized to, deliver the preliminary offering memorandum to any other person. You may not
transmit the attached preliminary offering memorandum (or any copy of it or part thereof) or disclose,
whether orally or in writing, any of its contents to any other person except with the explicit consent of
the Initial Purchasers. If you receive this document by e-mail, you should not reply by e-mail to this
announcement. Any reply e-mail communications, including those you generate by using the “Reply”
function on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive this document by e-mail,
your use of this e-mail is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that
it is free from viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an
offer or solicitation in any place where such offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a
jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers
or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering
shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such
jurisdiction.

Under no circumstances shall the preliminary offering memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which
such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The preliminary offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United
Kingdom and is for distribution only to persons who (i) fall within the definition of investment
professionals (as defined in Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial


-----

Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) are persons falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (such as certain high net worth companies and unincorporated associations) of
the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity within the meaning of section 21 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) in connection with the issue or sale of any
securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons
together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The preliminary offering memorandum is directed
only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant
persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the preliminary offering memorandum relates
is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the
issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to the Issuer.

that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of
electronic transmission, and consequently neither the Initial Purchasers, nor any person who controls
the Initial Purchasers, nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents accepts any liability or
responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the preliminary offering memorandum
distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version available to you on request from the
Initial Purchasers.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION. DATED APRIL 17, 2018**
**Preliminary Offering Memorandum** **Strictly Confidential**
**Not for general distribution in the United States**

**Sigma Holdco B.V.**
**€1,050,000,000 (equivalent)**
**$** **% Senior Notes due 2026**
**€** **% Senior Notes due 2026**
Sigma Holdco B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands
(the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) €1,050,000,000 (equivalent) aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes, comprising of $ % Senior Notes
due 2026 (the “Dollar Notes”) and € % Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Euro Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes”). The proceeds
from the Offering will be used as part of the financing for the proposed acquisition of Flora Food Group (as defined herein).
The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on each and, commencing, 2018.
The Notes will mature on, 2026. Prior to, 2021, the Issuer may redeem at its option all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date and the
applicable “make-whole” premium as described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). At any time on or after, 2021, the
Issuer may redeem at its option all or part of the Notes by paying the applicable redemption price as set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Prior to
, 2021, the Issuer may also redeem at its option up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes with the net proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price specified in this Offering Memorandum, provided that at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of
such series remains outstanding after the redemption. Prior to, 2021, the Issuer may, during each twelve-month period commencing on the Issue
Date, redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the relevant series of Notes upon the occurrence of certain
changes in applicable tax law at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any. Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may also be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes
at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not
be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.
Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into a euro-denominated
segregated bank account and a dollar-denominated segregated bank account, in each case controlled by the Issuer, as applicable (the “Deposit Accounts”) to
hold such amounts pending the consummation of the Acquisition (as defined herein). On or about the Issue Date, the Issuer will assign as security its rights,
title and interest in the credit balance in each of the Deposit Accounts to Deutsche Trustee Company Limited (the “Trustee”). The release of the funds credited
to the Deposit Accounts and the consummation of the Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In the event that, (i) the completion
date of the Acquisition (the “Completion Date”) does not take place on or prior to December 3, 2018 (the “Longstop Date”), (ii) in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Longstop Date, (iii) the Offer Letter (as defined herein) or, if executed, the Acquisition
Agreement (as defined herein), terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date, or (iv) certain other events occur, the Issuer will redeem the Notes at a
price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to (but not
including) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date). See “Description of the Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”
The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness. The
Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (the “Guarantees”) initially by Sigma Midco B.V. (“Midco”), Sigma US LLC (“U.S. Midco”), Sigma
Bidco B.V. (“Bidco”) and Sigma US Corp. (“U.S. Bidco,” and, together with Midco, U.S. Midco and Bidco, the “Initial Guarantors”) and, assuming the completion
date of the Acquisition (the “Completion Date”) occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date, by certain additional subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the
Senior Credit Facilities (as defined herein) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Completion Date but in any case no later than 120 days from the
Completion Date (the “Target Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantee by each of the Guarantors will be
(i) subordinated in right and priority of payment to certain existing and future senior indebtedness of the Group (including the Guarantors’ obligations under or
in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (as defined herein) and certain hedging obligations (if any)); (ii) senior in right of payment to any existing
and future obligations of such Guarantor that are expressly subordinated to such Guarantee of the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated in right of payment to
any existing and future secured indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including the senior
secured guarantees given by such Guarantors in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations; and (iv) structurally
subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness, including obligations to trade creditors of subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors. In
addition, the Guarantees will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations.
On or about the Issue Date, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the security granted by the Issuer in favor of the Security
Agent over (a) all of the issued Capital Stock in Midco held by the Issuer and (b) any present and future receivables under any material structural intercompany
loan provided by the Issuer to Midco (which will include from on or about the Completion Date, any receivables owed to the Issuer by Midco under the Proceeds
Loan) (together, the “Collateral”) will extend to secure the Notes on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Notes and all other indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes will receive
proceeds from the Collateral only after creditors of certain existing and future senior indebtedness of the Group (including the lenders under the Senior Credit
Facilities and counterparties to certain priority hedging obligations) have been repaid in full. See “Summary—The Offering—Security.” The security interests and
Guarantees will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations. The Collateral and the Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances.
The Notes will be issued in the form of global notes in registered form. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” The Dollar Notes will be issued in denominations
of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and the Euro Notes will be issued in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof. The Dollar Notes are expected to be delivered to investors in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), and the Euro
Notes are expected to be delivered to investors in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A.
(“Clearstream”), in each case, on or about, 2018 (the “Issue Date”).
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing
of the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and admission to trade on the Exchange. There is no assurance that the
Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be maintained.
**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 34.**

**Act”), or the laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes and Guarantees may not be offered or sold within the United States, except to “qualified**

Notes) or a nominee of DTC (with respect to the Dollar Notes). Beneficial interests in the global notes
will be shown on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global notes will be effected only through,
records maintained by Euroclear and/or Clearstream or DTC and their participants, as applicable. After
the initial issuance of the global notes, Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the
global notes only as set forth in the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold,
except as permitted under the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable state securities laws, pursuant to
registration or an exemption therefrom. As a prospective investor, you should be aware that you may
be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. Please refer to
the sections in this Offering Memorandum entitled “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to Investors.” By
possessing this Offering Memorandum or purchasing any Note, you will be deemed to have
represented and agreed to all of the provisions contained in that section of this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer reserves the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. The Issuer is making the Offering
subject to the terms described in this Offering Memorandum and the purchase agreement relating to
the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers also
reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes and the Guarantees in whole or in part for
any reason or no reason and to allot to any prospective purchaser less than the full amount of the
Notes sought by it. The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers also reserve the right to sell less than all the
Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers and certain of their respective
related entities may also acquire or may have already acquired, for their own accounts, a portion of the
Notes.

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of, and permission to deal in, the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange and the Issuer will submit this Offering Memorandum to the Authority in
connection with the listing application.

In the course of any review by the relevant competent authority, the Issuer may be requested to make
changes to the financial and other information included in this Offering Memorandum in producing
listing particulars for such listing. Comments by a competent authority may require significant
modification or reformulation of information contained in this Offering Memorandum or may require the
inclusion of additional information. The appropriate competent authority may also require the Issuer to

iii


-----

update the information in this Offering Memorandum to reflect changes in its business, financial
condition or results of operations and prospects. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be
listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or
that such listing will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this
listing. Any investor or potential investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) should not base
any investment decision relating to the Notes on the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum after publication of the listing particulars and should refer instead to those listing
particulars.

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE/PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY**
**TARGET MARKET**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Memorandum under the section entitled “Notice
_to Investors.”_

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be ten business days (as such
term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”)) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred
to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the
next seven successive business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement code at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such
trades should consult their own advisors. See “Plan of Distribution.”

that sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the registration requirements of
Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.

Neither the SEC, any U.S. state securities commission nor any non-U.S. securities authority has

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Mediation
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of

No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPS Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of
Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under Directive
2003/71/EC (as amended, the “Prospectus Directive”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Directive. No prospectus is required in accordance with the Prospectus Directive for this issue of
Notes.

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the Offering located within a member state of the EEA
will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is it is not a retail investor. For
the purposes of this provision the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of
the following: (a) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (b) a customer
within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. The Issuer, the Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates and others will rely upon the trust and accuracy of the foregoing representation,
acknowledgement and agreement.

“continue,” “ongoing,” “future,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “guidance,” “target,” “seek,” “could” or
“should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology or by
discussions of strategies, plans, objectives, targets, goals, future events or intentions. These
forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts; they include statements
about the Issuer’s beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. They appear in a
number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements that concern, among
other things:

 - strategies, outlook and growth prospects;

available to the Issuer’s management. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as at the date
they are made, and the Issuer undertakes no obligation to update any of them in light of new
information or future events. Although the Issuer believes that the expectations reflected in such
forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove
to be correct.

Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and
uncertainties. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a
number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements. FFG’s actual results may differ materially as a result of
various factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:

 - our separation from Unilever;

 - historical results failing to predict future results as a separate stand-alone company;

 - assumptions used to calculate pro forma Normalized EBITDA;

 - decrease in purchasing power following our separation from Unilever;

 - decrease in selling power following our separation from Unilever;

 - temporary increase in working capital needs following our separation from Unilever;

 - risks associated with our information technology systems;

 - fluctuations in the cost and availability of our key raw materials;

 - an inability to pass on price increases;

 - our relationships with key customers;

 - credit risk with respect to key customers and suppliers;

 - inadequate protection of our intellectual property;

 - adverse developments with respect to the safety and quality of our products;

 - seasonal fluctuations in demand;

 - potential liabilities and costs from litigation;

 - economic and political conditions in our key markets;

 - adverse changes to the tax regimes to which we are subject and determinations of tax regulators
that result in adverse tax consequences;

The foregoing factors and others described under “Risk Factors” should not be construed as
exhaustive. Due to such uncertainties and risks, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these forward-looking statements, which speak only as at the date of this Offering Memorandum. The
Issuer urges you to read this Offering Memorandum, including the sections entitled “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and

viii


-----

“Business,” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect its future performance and
the industry in which it operates. Moreover, FFG operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing
environment. It may face new risks from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all such risks; nor
can it assess the impact of all such risks on its business or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

The Issuer undertakes no obligation, and does not intend, to release publicly the result of any revisions
to these forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of this Offering Memorandum, including changes in its business or strategy or planned capital
expenditure, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a private company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) on December 12, 2017, for the purpose of
facilitating the Acquisition and facilitating the financing of the Acquisition (as well as subsequent
financings), having its official seat (statutaire zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and its office at
Overschiestraat 61-5 hoog, 1062 XD Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Issuer is registered with the
Dutch Trade Register of the Chamber of Commerce under number the number 70282900. The Issuer
has no material assets or liabilities and has not engaged in any activities other than those related to its
incorporation and in preparation for the Transactions. Consequently, no historical financial information
relating to the Issuer is available.

**The Financial Statements**

The combined carve-out financial statements of the spreads business of Unilever PLC and Unilever
N.V. for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016 and December 31 2017 are
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum and are referred to herein as the “Financial
Statements.”

**_Unilever’s Spreads Business_**

The spreads business, on a worldwide basis, is not operated by Unilever from within separate legal
entity structures. However, during the year ended December 31, 2015, certain aspects of the spreads
business were reorganized into a newly created Baking, Cooking and Spreads group of legal entities in
certain regions of the world (most of Europe and North America). The BCS legal entities combined and
carved-out in these financial statements are listed in note 21 of the Financial Statements. Furthermore,
the supply chain companies, factories and marketing and sales organizations operated by Unilever run
both spreads and non-spreads activities.

The Financial Statements have therefore been prepared on a combined and carve-out basis from
Unilever’s consolidated financial statements for the purpose of presenting the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of the spreads business as set forth under “—Basis of Preparation”
below.

The combined carve-out Financial Statements include every territory in which Unilever operates
spreads-related business activities, except for South Africa. Unilever’s spreads business, as described
in the Financial Statements, is generally referred to herein as “FFG” or “Flora Food Group.”

**_Basis of Preparation_**

The combined carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and
under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated, and present the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of FFG for each of the periods and as of the dates indicated
therein.

The combined carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with this basis of
preparation, which is consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU
and as issued by the IASB, except as set out below:

    - IFRS as adopted by the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB do not provide for the
preparation of combined carve-out financial statements and accordingly in preparing the
combined carve-out Financial Statements certain accounting conventions commonly used for
the preparation of historical financial information for inclusion in investment circulars as
described in the Annexure to SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standards applicable to public
reporting engagements on historical financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices
Board have been applied. Further details on the application of these accounting conventions
can be found below and in the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Explanation of Certain Income Statement_
_Items” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—Explanation of Certain Balance Sheet Items.”_

x


-----

The combined carve-out Financial Statements:

    - have been prepared by combining and carving-out the assets, liabilities, income and
expenses that management have determined relate to Unilever’s spreads business. Those
amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the Unilever entities
running spreads activities, which also include allocations and recharges by Unilever of indirect
central costs and general corporate expenses. The underlying financial records of Unilever
are maintained in accordance with EU and IASB IFRS;

    - include a cash flow statement showing movement arising from operating, investing and
financing activities of the spreads business that is independent of Unilever’s centralized
approach to cash management and financing; and

    - disclose the cumulative investment of Unilever in the spreads business as net parent (deficit) /
investment.

The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that management have determined relate to Unilever’s
spreads business include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the
spreads business, together with an allocation of the items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments
and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out
Financial Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. Those are
described in more detail in the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition_ _and_ _Results_ _of_ _Operations—Explanation of_ _Certain_ _Income_ _Statement_ _Items”_ and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Explanation of Certain Balance Sheet Items.”_

The combined carve-out Financial Statements apply consistently, unless otherwise stated, the
accounting policies, the material estimates and judgments made that are disclosed therein.
A description of the carve-out allocation procedures used in the preparation of the combined carve-out
Financial Statements is set forth in the notes to the combined carve-out Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The combined carve-out Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect the financial position, results
of operations or cash flows of Unilever’s spreads business if it had been a separate entity, or the future
results of FFG as it will exist upon the completion of the separation from Unilever. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—FFG’s historical results may not be representative_
_of its future results as a separate, stand-alone company” and “Summary—Summary Historical and_
_Other Financial Information.”_

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this
Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your
own professional advisors for an understanding of the financial information contained in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Other Financial Measures**

**_Non-IFRS Financial Measures_**

We have presented certain information in this Offering Memorandum that is not required by, nor
presented in accordance with, IFRS. Please see “Summary _Historical_ _and_ _Other_ _Financial_
_Information—Other Key Financial and Operating Information—Summary Pro Forma Data of the_
_Issuer.” As used in this Offering Memorandum, this information includes:_

 - **Underlying Sales Growth: Underlying Sales Growth or USG represents turnover for the period**
on a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals.

The constant currency exchange rate is calculated using the measures described below under
“—Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures.”

 - **EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments: EBITDA before exceptional**
bonus and share-based payments represents net profit before taxation, net interest cost,
amortisation of intangible assets—direct, depreciation of property, plant and equipment—direct
and exceptional bonus and share-based payments adjustment.

xi


-----

 - **Normalized EBITDA: Normalized EBITDA represents EBITDA before exceptional bonus and**
share-based payments, adjusted for non-underlying items, Portuguese Joint Venture adjustment,
allocated amortisation of intangible assets, allocated depreciation of property, plant and
equipment, and finance costs related to pension and similar obligations.

For purposes of calculating Normalized EBITDA, “Portuguese Joint Venture adjustment” reflects
the recognition of the non-Unilever share of net profit of the joint venture and the interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization relating to that joint venture.

Management believes that Normalized EBITDA is a helpful indicator of the underlying
performance of the pre-separation business, as it adjusts EBITDA before exceptional bonus and
share-based payments principally for non-underlying items comprised of restructuring costs such
as those arising from the consolidation of multiple U.S. factories into one facility at New Century,
Kansas.

 - **_Pro forma Normalized EBITDA: pro forma Normalized EBITDA represents Normalized EBITDA_**
adjusted to reflect: (i) Carve-out adjustments from day one; (ii) Implemented 2017 savings
initiatives; (iii) Completion Date SG&A cost savings, (iv) Impact of commodity prices, (v) sharebased payments adjustment and (vi) other adjustments (see note n to footnote 4 to the table in
“Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information—Other Key Financial and
_Operating Information”)._

Management believes that pro forma Normalized EBITDA is a helpful indicator of the underlying
performance and profitability of the business as it takes into account cost savings and other
adjustments associated with the implementation of its strategic plan and separation from Unilever.

 - **Normalized EBITDA margin: Normalized EBITDA margin for any given region represents**
Normalized EBITDA (and including or excluding completion date SG&A cost savings, as the case
may be) for that region divided by turnover for that region, expressed as a percentage.

 - **_Pro forma Normalized EBITDA margin: Pro forma Normalized EBITDA margin for any given_**
region represents pro forma Normalized EBITDA for that region divided by turnover for that region
after deducting the Distributor model adjustment applicable for that region (see note i to footnote 4
to the table in “Summary—Summary Historical and Other Financial Information—Other Key
_Financial and Operating Information”), expressed as a percentage._

 - **Underlying free cash flow and Underlying free cash flow conversion ratio: Underlying free**
cash flow represents Cash flow from operating activities (i) plus a Portuguese joint venture
adjustment, (ii) plus provisions less payments, (iii) less elimination of losses on disposals, (iv) less
non-cash charge for share-based payments, (v) plus non-underlying items within operating profit,
(vi) plus other adjustments from cash flow statement, (vii) less capital expenditure,
(viii) exceptional bonus and share-based payment adjustment. Underlying free cash flow
conversion ratio is calculated by dividing Underlying free cash flow by Normalized EBITDA, and
expressing the result as a percentage.

Management believes that Underlying free cash flow and the Underlying free cash flow conversion
ratio are a helpful indicators of the fundamental cash generative ability of the business on a
steady-state basis.

 - **Constant currency exchange rate: See “—Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures.”**

Management believes that constant exchange rate measures are helpful indicators of the
underlying performance of the business.

FFG’s management believes that the foregoing non-IFRS financial measures are helpful indicators of
the underlying performance and profitability of the business. Management believes that the foregoing
non-IFRS Financial measures are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of FFG’s
operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and, because these measures are used by
management to track business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make
important business decisions. In addition, management believes that these measures are commonly
used by investors, security analysts and other interested parties in FFG’s industry as supplemental
measures of operating performance and liquidity. Although the Issuer is presenting these measures to
enhance the understanding of FFG’s historical operating performance, they should not be considered
alternatives to operating profit as an indicator of operating performance, or alternatives to cash flows
from operating activities as measures of liquidity.

xii


-----

You should not consider Underlying Sales Growth, EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based
payments, Normalized EBITDA, pro forma Normalized EBITDA, Underlying free cash flow, constant
exchange rate measures or any other non-IFRS measures presented herein as alternatives to
measures of financial performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, such as operating profit, as a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of
liquidity. Underlying Sales Growth, EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments,
Normalized EBITDA, pro forma Normalized EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under
IFRS. In addition, the Issuer’s computation of EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based
payments, Normalized EBITDA, pro forma Normalized EBITDA and other non-IFRS financial measures
may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures or ratios used by other companies.

EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments, Normalized EBITDA, pro forma
Normalized EBITDA and Underlying free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should
not consider any of them in isolation. Some of these limitations include the following: (i) they do not
reflect capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
(ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) they do not
reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments
on debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being
depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and do not reflect any cash
requirements that would be required for such replacements.

Our presentation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA has additional limitations as an analytical tool. For
example, pro forma Normalized EBITDA does not reflect expenses and capital expenditures that FFG
expects to incur to transition to a stand-alone business, which we currently estimate will be
approximately €200 million in transition-related expenses and one time expenditures, including
approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs that we expect FFG to incur as
it transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform, and
approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as certain manufacturing and
management functions are separated from Unilever and relocated (before any offsetting gains from
land sales are considered). The substantial majority of these expenses are expected to be incurred
over an extended period, up to an including the year ending December 31, 2019.

Such measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have not been audited or prepared in
accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of financial
information in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting
requirements of the SEC which would apply if the offering of the Notes were being registered with the
SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of the
financial information included herein.

**Constant Currency Exchange Rate Measures**

We are a geographically diversified business with operations around the world and accordingly we
undertake transactions in various currencies. Many of our subsidiaries report their financial results in
currencies other than the euro, the reporting currency of our consolidated financial statements. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Business and Industry—FFG is exposed to foreign exchange
_rate risks and such rates may adversely affect its results of operations.” To enhance the comparability_
of our historical financial results between the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, in
certain instances in this Offering Memorandum such results are presented using constant currency
exchange rates. Measures calculated using constant currency exchange rates are unaudited, not
presented in accordance with IFRS, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of FFG’s results or
any financial measure under IFRS. The exchange rates used for the calculation of constant exchange
rate measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have been derived from average rates in effect
over the year ended December 31, 2016 for all of FFG’s relevant currencies. The principal exchange
rates are the following:

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Unless otherwise indicated, statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding the market
environment, market developments, growth rates, market trends and the competitive situation in the
markets and segments in which we operate are based on data, statistical information, sector reports
and third-party studies as well as on our own estimates.

Unless otherwise stated, industry data in this Offering Memorandum from Euromonitor International,
Nielsen, Millward Brown, Kantar Worldpanel, BMI Research (a Fitch Group Company) and GlobalData
Plc. (collectively the “Industry Data Providers” and each individually an “Industry Data Provider”)
was sourced at various points in time, from April 2017 to September 2017, and, in each instance,
reflects the data available at such point in time and does not reflect further updates after it was
sourced.

To the extent that information was taken from third parties, such information has been accurately
reproduced by us in this Offering Memorandum and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from
the information published by these third parties, no facts have been omitted which would render the
reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, market studies and analyses are frequently
based on information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their
methodology is by nature forward-looking and speculative. In particular, no responsibility or liability can
be accepted by any Industry Data Provider or any of its affiliates, nor any of its directors nor employees
for any errors or omissions in any data from the Industry Data Providers included in this Offering
Memorandum nor for any loss arising from reliance placed on such data. When information in this
Offering Memorandum is attributed to multiple external sources, including one or more Industry Data
Providers, such information is based on FFG’s analysis thereof.

We have not verified the figures, market data and other information used by third parties in our studies,
publications and financial information, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We
therefore assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and
third-party sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of data on which our
estimates are based.

This Offering Memorandum also contains estimations of market data and information derived from
such data that cannot be obtained from publications by market research institutes or from other
independent sources. Such information is partly based on our own market observations, the evaluation
of industry information (such as from conferences and sector events) or internal assessments. We
believe that our estimates of market data and the information we have derived from such data helps
investors to better understand the industry we operate in and our position within it. Our own estimates
have not been checked or verified externally. We nevertheless believe that our own market
observations are reliable. We give no warranty for the accuracy of our own estimates and the
information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from future
studies conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources.

year ended December 31, 2017. This is complemented by its line of dairy cream alternatives, which
represented 6% of turnover for the same period, Liquids products (including liquid margarine,
vegetable cooking oils and olive oil), which represented 7% of turnover for the same period, and other
products which represented 4% of turnover for the same period.

FFG is a market leader in North America and Western Europe and has a strong presence across
emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia with number one positions in 44
of its 69 markets. In each of these countries, FFG sells its products predominantly to retail outlets,
including to many of the world’s largest retailers and their chains of supermarkets, hypermarkets,
convenience stores and e-commerce platforms, as well as to wholesalers. FFG also supplies the
foodservice channel, including restaurants, hotels, workplace and educational canteens and healthcare
facilities.

In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, FFG had turnover of €3,294.9 million,
€3,031.7 million and €2,904.9 million, respectively, net profit of €453.6 million, €422.5 million and
€565.1 million, respectively, and Normalized EBITDA of €723.0 million, €686.3 million and
€674.0 million, respectively. Pro Forma Normalized EBITDA was €819.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

**Strengths**

We believe that FFG benefits from the following key strengths:

**_Number one player globally with a leading portfolio of iconic brands_**

FFG has a strong portfolio of diversified, iconic brands that are well represented across both developed
and emerging markets. In the year ended December 31, 2016, FFG had an approximately 32% share
of the global margarine market and, within the global B&M category, was more than four times larger
than the number two player. Across its core developed markets, FFG has very strong market
positioning, with a share of the margarine segment greater than 50% in the U.S.A (59%), Germany
(63%), the U.K. (57%) and the Netherlands (74%) in the year ended December 31, 2016, based on
retail sales value. With a history of manufacturing and distributing category-leading products for nearly
150 years, FFG has an established global position with demonstrable brand recognition and customer
loyalty.

FFG has seven brands with a turnover of at least €175 million. These brands are Becel (2017 turnover:
€327 million), Rama (2017 turnover: €321 million), Blue Band (2017 turnover: €254 million), Country

Crock (2017 turnover: €242 million), Flora (2017 turnover: €208 million), I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!
(2017 turnover: €197 million) and ProActiv (2017 turnover: €175 million). FFG’s portfolio benefits from
strong brand equity, enjoying an average aided brand awareness of approximately 89% (in 2016),
according to Millward Brown, making them some of the most recognizable packaged food brands in
their respective markets.

FFG’s brand range targets specific and distinct sub-categories within the B&M segment, such as family
nutrition, heart health, cholesterol lowering, taste, cooking & baking, and value. The comprehensive
range offered means that FFG caters for specific consumption across all main use occasions
(spreading, cooking and baking), formats (wrappers, tubs and liquids) and storing conditions (chilled,
ambient and tropical ambient products).

**_Diversified across geographies with leading country shares in both developed markets and_**
**_emerging markets_**

FFG is present in 69 countries globally with a number one position in the B&M category in 44 of these
countries, based on retail margarine volume ranking. These 44 markets represented 89% of FFG’s
turnover in 2016.

FFG is number one in 10 of its largest 11 countries by turnover. In its largest markets by
turnover—U.S.A., Germany and the U.K.—FFG has an approximately 60% share in the margarine
segment and was respectively three times, nine times and twice as large as the number two branded
player in each such country in the year ended December 31, 2016, measured by retail sales value. Of
these 11 markets, only in France was FFG the number two branded player in margarine, with a market
share of 35% (one percentage point behind the number one player by market share) in the year ended
December 31, 2016, based on retail sales value.

FFG generated €2,302.0 million of turnover from its developed markets in the year ended
December 31, 2017, representing 79% of total sales. In developed markets, the business is present in
28 countries and number one in 22 of those countries, with key countries including the U.S.A.,
Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands.

FFG also benefits from significant scale in emerging markets, with €602.9 million of turnover attributed
to emerging markets in the year ended December 31, 2017, making it one of the largest emerging
markets food businesses globally. Emerging market countries represented 21% of total sales for the
year ended December 31, 2017, with the business present in 41 countries and number one in 24 of
these, with key countries including Kenya, Mexico and Indonesia. FFG maintains a strong position
across its growing emerging markets, as demonstrated by its share of the margarine segment in Kenya
(90%), Indonesia (63%) and Mexico (69%) in the year ended December 31, 2016, based on retail
sales value.

With its significant research and development capabilities supporting a comprehensive procurement,
production and distribution chain, FFG is well placed to expand into new geographies and consolidate
existing local market share. FFG is also well positioned to leverage its proprietary fast-blending
technology to enter new markets with lower upfront capital expenditure.

**_Strong and sustainable profitability and cash flow conversion_**

FFG has a demonstrated track record of strong profitability, with net profit of €422.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016 and €565.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Normalized
EBITDA margin was 22.6% in the year ended December 31, 2016 and 23.2% in the year ended
December 31, 2017. Normalized EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 23.6% in
FFG’s developed markets and 21.9% in its emerging markets, reflecting the strength of FFG’s truly
global business. Pro Forma Normalized EBITDA was €819.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2017.

FFG benefits from strong cash generation and generated a net cash flow from operating activities of
€558.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 and €548.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017, with an underlying free cash flow conversion ratio of 94.2% in the year ended
December 31, 2016 and 99.8% in the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares favorably with
peers and is supported by the following:

    - Variable Cost Structure. Approximately 75% of FFG’s cost base is variable, allowing for a
sustainable gross margin. FFG has clear, consistent and well-established supply chain and
hedging policies with respect to its major commodity inputs and foreign exchange exposures,
which has allowed it to maintain strong levels of profitability after direct costs in changing cost
environments.

    - High profitability with separation upside. FFG has demonstrably high and sustained
profitability, with an Normalized EBITDA margin of greater than 20% in each of the financial
years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, largely attributable to FFG’s flexible cost

-----

structure and recent track record of operational cost savings. We believe there is significant
scope for further improvement, as described below under “—Strategy—Realize significant
_cost savings opportunity.”_

    - Well-invested manufacturing base and supply chain. FFG has a comprehensive
manufacturing network with a well-invested supply chain and significant spare capacity,
including in its emerging markets. This allows for increased sales volumes without
incremental capital expenditure resulting in strong cash generation.

    - Efficient working capital position. FFG’s cash flow conversion is additionally supported by a
favorable working capital position. A normalized negative working capital position is the result
of effectively managed inventory, structurally low receivable days due to attractive payment
terms on customer rebates, and attractive standard payment terms for FFG’s key raw
materials (primarily edible oils). With beneficial relationships with its core suppliers, FFG is
able to leverage payment terms of up to 120 days to mitigate the risk that cash is
underutilized within the business. This is compared with average inventory days of 25 and
average receivable days from customers of 20, in each case for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

**_A well-invested global manufacturing network with significant spare capacity_**

FFG’s approach to maintaining leading facilities and its strong historic cash flow generation has
enabled it to invest significantly in its global operations. FFG’s ten developed market and seven
emerging market facilities are fully invested, and have significant excess capacity, with unconstrained
utilization of 49% on average in the year ended December 31, 2016. This well-invested asset base
allowed for a low level of capital expenditure of 1.0% of turnover in the year ending December 31,
2017. Raw materials represented 45% of total supply chain costs and production costs represented
30% of total supply chain costs in the year ending December 31, 2017. In addition, in recent years,
FFG has invested significant capital in two new facilities. FFG invested over €200 million in 2014 and
2015 into its U.S. supply chain infrastructure, in particular the development of the New Century plant in
Kansas in the U.S.A., one of the biggest margarine facilities in the world. A new facility was also
constructed in Nigeria during 2016 and 2017, enabling access to high-growth West African markets.
Through these investments, FFG has also ensured it has the latest manufacturing innovations at its
disposal, including utilization of its proprietary cool blending and fast blending technologies (as detailed
further below).

**_Efficient supply chain infrastructure_**

FFG’s market leading products benefit from its sophisticated procurement, production and distribution
functions. FFG’s procurement process focuses on a simple portfolio of materials (primarily various oils
and blends) that it is able to source at competitive prices by leveraging its scale and flexibility. In the
year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 68% of FFG’s raw material costs were attributable to
six materials and approximately 45% of material value was procured through suppliers for which FFG
represented more than 75% of total Unilever spend.

FFG employs an asset-light distribution strategy, with most warehouses and all transport outsourced to
third parties. This allows forward-looking and market-driven inventory management with an average of
25 inventory days in the year ended December 31, 2017. Distribution costs accounted for 10% of
FFG’s total supply chain costs in the year ending December 31, 2017. In addition, there is expected to
be limited loss of distribution scale following the separation from Unilever, as over 81% of current
distribution spend within the business is on infrastructure and providers dedicated to FFG’s product
range, given the lack of other chilled food categories within Unilever.

**_Leading product knowledge and capability and proprietory processes_**

FFG has a leading research and development platform which has benefitted from consistent
investment throughout the cycle. Its strong capabilities allow FFG to turn technological breakthroughs
into commercial successes in a short turnaround period. FFG continually enhances consumer
experience by developing flavors in-house, leveraging in-depth know-how of melting behavior and


4


-----

flavor release and by mapping flavor preferences in key segments and geographies. In collaboration
with governments and opinion formers, FFG has developed category leading products with nutritious
and stable characteristics, such as the only spreads product containing Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty
acids that is stable in ambient tropical conditions (such as those in Africa and Southeast Asia) and
products containing cholesterol-lowering ingredients. FFG has also partnered with local governments
in its emerging markets to launch public healthy eating campaigns, capitalizing on the perception of
margarine as a healthy and aspirational product in the region.

FFG also has a strong track record in process innovation. FFG has realized considerable cost benefits
from recipe formulation and raw material optimization, underpinning its cost leadership. In particular, it
has the ability to manage fluctuations in raw material costs while maintaining the optimal designed
performance and a rapid and pro-active development process allowing quick roll out across all
business units. FFG has been at the forefront of developing proprietary technologies and holds over
75 patents globally. In particular, FFG has developed several proprietary manufacturing processes,
including cool blending, which has given FFG a means of producing low fat margarine without
compromising taste and with clean-label capability, and fast blending, which provides lower production
costs and fast capacity expansion for emerging markets by using smaller scale and easily
transportable modular units.

FFG has developed a more agile research and development process, enabling turnaround of new
products from initial concept to product in three to six months. With digital modelling techniques, FFG
is able to predict the structure and melting properties of its spreads formulas, allowing acceleration in
innovation and superior product performance.

With a focus on plant-based innovation, FFG has relaunched several of its core brands with a
repositioning toward attractive and compelling value propositions: 100% plant-based offerings,
premium butter flavored mélanges with enhanced dairy content, adjacent products under common
branding and clean-label offerings. Notable successes have been achieved in FFG’s developed
markets in 2017 with the launch of innovative products, such as the Becel chocolate spread in the
Netherlands and the “with butter” Rama range in Germany, which has had a significant impact on retail
sales in the country. For example, the underlying sales growth or USG in the year ended
December 31, 2017 for Fruit d’Or in France, Rama in Poland, Becel in the Nordics and Becel in the
Netherlands was +4.6%, +3.1%, +2.7% and +0.7%, respectively.

**_Experienced management team, already delivering on transformational strategy_**

FFG benefits from a management team with significant experience in the consumer packaged goods
industry. The senior management team has been part of FFG’s transition from a part of Unilever to a
stand-alone business and has been heavily involved in developing and preparing for the execution of
our business transformation plans. Management believes that it leads a strong organization with
talented individuals that fosters a market-driven, entrepreneurial culture.

Key accomplishments of FFG’s management team to date include: (i) delivery of underlying sales
growth improvement in developed markets in 2017, and robust growth across FFG’s emerging markets
through strategy execution and a significant increase in the number and impact of on-trend
innovations; (ii) strong, consistent profitability and cash generation across 2015-2017 through
managing FFG’s flexible cost structure and achieving significant cost savings; (iii) increased share of
the margarine segment in key geographies; and (iv) reorganization of FFG into a more agile and
consumer-centric business. Management’s plans to take the business to its next phase of
transformational development are very much under way, with demonstrable evidence of successful
implementation of its strategy since the reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into
the BCS entities in 2015. FFG’s management team is also expected to be incentivized by a typical
private equity incentive scheme tied to the overall performance of KKR’s investment in the business.

KKR has also moved to reinforce the team in its new existence as a stand-alone company by
announcing the appointment, effective as of closing of the Acquisition, of David Haines as Executive
Chairman and Jesper Andersen as our new Chief Financial Officer. Mr Haines and Mr Andersen will
bring experience and a track record of success in managing stand-alone businesses in the consumer

sector. See “Recent Developments—Executive Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Management
_Transition.”_

**Strategy**

FFG intends to capitalize on the foregoing strengths by implementing the following clear and
compelling strategy:

**_Accelerate clearly defined initiatives to stabilize Developed Markets_**

The factors which have resulted in historical underperformance in FFG’s developed markets have been
clearly identified, relating partly to external factors that have impacted the performance of the overall
margarine category and partly to internal constraints resulting from the business’ historical ownership
by Unilever.

External factors

External factors which have contributed to developed market underperformance include:

    - a moderate reduction in consumption occasions (e.g. bread consumption) in some developed
markets;

    - consumer misconception around the healthiness of margarine relative to butter (in particular
due to legacy concerns around partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, which have not been
included in any of FFG’s products since 2012); and

    - a period of depressed European butter prices from the second half of 2014 through the first
half of 2017 due to the removal of dairy quotas in Europe and the imposition of the Russian
trade embargo on some European dairy products, resulting in a reduction in the differential
between margarine and butter prices, which has since reversed by the end of 2017.

Internal factors

As part of Unilever, FFG was constrained in its ability to develop an independent growth strategy. The
spreads category was not a core strategic priority for Unilever. As a result, until the internal
reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities and the creation of
the current dedicated management structure in 2015, the business had not been given sufficient
management focus and was run primarily to maintain margin and generate cash flows to enable
investment in other areas of Unilever’s business. These internal constraints included:

    - a limited response to changing consumer preferences toward naturalness and taste;

    - a lack of response to category shifts and insufficient investment through marketing and new
product launches; and

    - absence of a dedicated sales function and category leadership, with a limited focus on the
business as part of the ongoing dialogue with retailers despite Unilever’s significant market
shares in each of its core geographies, which resulted in lack of retailer engagement and
investment in growing the category.

Since the internal reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities
2015, FFG’s management have developed and commenced implementation of a comprehensive
strategy to stabilize the developed markets business and support a return to moderate growth. This
strategy is clearly centered on the importance of restoring the naturalness and health perception of
FFG’s key products, clearly defining the specific strategy for each brand, and improving the taste
profile of FFG products. In order to deliver these initiatives, FFG intends to make a one-time brand and
marketing investment of €175 million in total over the short to medium term.

-----

In order to “revitalize the core” of its business, FFG management believes there are a number of key
areas that can be readily addressed with increased focus and attention:

_Naturalness and Health_

Management intends to re-align the consumer perception of margarine on the grounds of relative
health benefits to butter and the product’s overall naturalness. Margarine is fundamentally a natural,
plant-based product, and this message will be at the core of FFG’s marketing campaign aiming to
educate the public on margarine’s advantages over butter.

A key component of FFG’s strategy is to communicate more clearly the natural and healthy credentials
of margarine to consumers, enabled by more effectively leveraging key influencers such as social
media personalities and environmental and animal welfare groups to capture the growing plant-based
nutrition trend and transitioning to clean labels on key product ranges. FFG plans to advance
innovation focused on improving natural credentials in its core range and to redesign packaging of
these products to increase naturalness cues, with the potential to move to paper wrap and
biodegradable or transparent packaging that align more closely with the interests of modern
consumers. Notably, five out of FFG’s six key products do not currently have a clean-label offering
(Country Crock in the U.S.A. moved to clean label in 2015). This represents a significant opportunity
for FFG to invest in ensuring that its core family focused product offering contains no artificial
ingredients, thereby enhancing consumer perceptions of naturalness.

_Brand_

Management intends to focus on developing FFG’s brand portfolio to clarify the use occasion
positioning and price architecture of its key brands. Management believes these measures will enable
more effective targeting of key consumer groups looking for specific features from their products, such
as plant-based nutrition or dairy-like taste, and clarity around use occasions, such as spreading,
cooking or baking. For example, FFG has begun to reposition the Country Crock brand in the U.S.A.
around the focused attributes of “plant-based” and naturalness through the introduction of a clean-label
product recipe, as well as marketing and packaging initiatives that have demonstrated positive traction
with consumers.

_Taste_

Under Unilever ownership, a strong focus on heart health imposed by internal corporate guidelines led
to significant reductions in fat content, which impacted overall taste and “mouth-feel”. Going forward,
FFG will refocus on taste through improving formulations, as well as selectively increasing fat levels in
certain products. In this way, the taste profile of FFG’s Plant-Based Spreads will be improved without
changing the overall ingredient composition and, through rollout of upgraded recipes and additional
variants, FFG intends to target specific groups of consumers looking for different flavor profiles (for
example, mélanges for butter consumers).

Management has started to implement this strategy in certain brands over the last 12-24 months with
positive initial results. The Rama brand, for example, has undergone significant repositioning and
product variation with a 100% plant-based core brand and the introduction of a distinct “with butter”
range. Relaunched in December 2016, the brand has seen an underlying sales growth increase of
5.8% by the quarter ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.

Based on these strategies for the developed markets, and with the aid of a dedicated and focused
sales force, FFG, as the largest player, expects to both drive stabilization of the margarine category
overall as well as win share from its key competitors.

**_Continue to drive and enhance strong performance in emerging markets_**

Emerging markets are a core part of FFG’s strategy, where FFG is able to leverage its strong brand
and superior technology to offer high value, healthy and nutritious products to families around the
world. In addition, FFG is the only manufacturer offering high levels of nutritious fats, including a
margarine product containing Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids that is stable in tropical ambient
conditions.

The growth in opportunity in emerging market countries is supported by the favorable macroeconomic
trends of strong population growth and rising real household incomes. There is also a notable
opportunity to drive consumption among consumers in these countries, with the average consumption
of B&M products per capita in FFG’s emerging markets being approximately one sixth of consumers in
developed markets.

Demand drivers in emerging markets are fundamentally different than in developed markets, with
breakfast and baking occasions, especially during the holiday periods, the primary consumption
occasions in the emerging markets. Bread consumption is also increasing in selected FFG emerging
markets, which typically has a positive impact on the demand for B&M products. This trend offers an
opportunity for FFG to drive further penetration and create new consumption occasions to drive
volumes. Further, price elasticity is higher in emerging markets than in developed markets, which
further incentivizes consumers to choose margarine as an alternative to butter given its lower price.
Importantly, consumer perception of margarine in emerging markets is also fundamentally different:
customers typically see margarine as an aspirational product with strong taste and health attributes. In
particular, Blue Band, the leading FFG brand across emerging markets, is seen as an aspirational
product by consumers when compared to traditional cooking oils or private label spreads products.
This gives an incentive for consumers to “trade up” to FFG products on the back of higher purchasing
power due to strengthening macroeconomic conditions. The lack of chilled infrastructure also provides
a notable advantage for margarine (over butter) as margarine can be formulated to remain stable at
tropical ambient temperatures without refrigeration.

Management’s strategy for enhancing growth in emerging markets is based on the following core
drivers:

_Drive performance through operation as a standalone organization_

Operating as a standalone entity, FFG will be able to pursue opportunities that were not previously
considered when integrated within the wider Unilever business and quickly exploit new opportunities by
deploying the resources required. Management is focused on growing FFG’s share and penetration in
key emerging markets countries, which will be facilitated through operation as a standalone business.

_Focus on key health benefits in less-developed emerging markets countries_

Management intends to capitalize on the current perception of margarine in emerging markets as a
healthy, aspirational product by leveraging local partnerships with public stakeholders. Notably, FFG


8


-----

recently launched a “Good Breakfast” program in partnership with governments in several African
countries to encourage healthy eating initiatives, which has reached millions of Africans to date.
Management believes that FFG can reproduce the same approach in other emerging markets
countries going forward to encourage healthy eating and additional use occasions for FFG’s natural
product range.

_Drive distribution_

There are a number of opportunities related to distribution strategies in emerging markets that FFG can
pursue in order to improve the effectiveness of its operations and allow for faster growth. As an
independent organization, FFG will be able to establish new relationships and enter underpenetrated
countries where management sees significant opportunities. FFG believes it will be able to drive
distribution in this way at limited incremental cost, given the current average unconstrained utilization
rate (49% in the year ended December 30, 2016) across its facilities, which will allow for significant
scope to grow volumes. FFG recently invested in a new manufacturing plant in Nigeria which provides
the potential for growth opportunities across West Africa, allowing for increased regional distribution in
countries like Nigeria and Ghana.

Finally, beyond the geographies in which FFG is currently present, there are potential opportunities in
emerging markets not included in management’s current business plan, which represent a significant
source of additional upside.

**_Realize significant cost savings opportunity_**

In addition to revenue improvement and stabilization initiatives, FFG’s strategy also has a strong focus
on delivering cost savings and unlocking margin improvement potential. KKR, management and thirdparty diligence providers have conducted a comprehensive and granular review of FFG’s operating
model. We believe that as a stand-alone business, FFG will be able to realize significant cost savings
through the implementation of its business transformation strategy based on its track record of
delivering efficiencies. Through this process, a number of cost efficiency levers have been clearly
identified relating to the five following areas: (i) procurement; (ii) manufacturing; (iii) supply chain;
(iv) brand, marketing and investment (“BMI”) and (v) SG&A optimization. The Issuer estimates that
these represent, in the aggregate, an annual run-rate cost savings of approximately €200 million,
which the Issuer believes can be achieved over the medium term with the incurrence of approximately
€45 million to €50 million of non-recurring restructuring and related costs. The five areas of cost
optimization are outlined further below:

_Procurement and design to value_

Procurement within Unilever has been largely centralized and was outside of the control of FFG
management, thereby providing significant scope to transition to best practices within the procurement
function. The key raw materials (palm, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and canola oils) are primarily
sourced from six large suppliers with purchases covering requirements for the next 12 to 24 weeks.
The current procurement policies lack focus on volume consolidation and strategic sourcing
partnerships and do not fully exploit potential discount opportunities. Management believes that FFG’s
major suppliers are keen to secure volumes due to their relatively low margins and the large costs
associated with having to scale production up or down and there is therefore a significant cost saving
opportunity for FFG through volume bundling, entering into longer-term contracts and tendering
competitively across major suppliers.

Packaging-related cost savings entail the application of design-to-value principles and best-practice
procurement principles. Through design-to-value, FFG will be able to identify product features that
consumers value most in order to optimize the cost structure while still addressing key demand drivers.
Examples include simplifying the packaging of key products (s.a. moving away from aluminum foil to
lighter materials and reducing the lid thickness), which would enable FFG to save costs without
impacting customer perception and product appeal. Separately, FFG intends to adopt best-practice
procurement principles via entering into competitive tender processes and global consolidation with
scaled suppliers in order to optimize packaging input costs.


9


-----

We believe that the largest cost efficiency opportunity of the five identified above will be in
procurement.

_Manufacturing cost optimization_

Post carve-out cost efficiencies are anticipated across the manufacturing network. On a carve-out
basis, FFG operated in Europe with an average unconstrained utilization rate of 49% in the year ended
December 31, 2016, with production costs varying significantly throughout the European manufacturing
base from €76/ton to €270/ton. Other identified areas for manufacturing-related cost savings include
(i) enhanced planning and staffing especially since multiple machines are running at low capacity,
(ii) technology upgrades and use of more energy-efficient machinery/processes, (iii) launch of
preventive maintenance programs and (iv) reduction of scrap and waste levels.

We believe that the second largest cost efficiency opportunity of the five identified above will be in
manufacturing.

_Supply chain cost optimization_

Following the Acquisition, FFG’s European distribution network will comprise 18 distribution centers.
FFG currently serves almost every European country from local warehouses with limited cross-border
or direct shipments to customers. As a result, we believe that there are significant distribution structure
overlaps/duplications in certain countries. Separately, management believes that the supply chain
costs could be further optimized via competitive tendering of transport lanes, re-designing routes based
on FFG’s streamlined distribution network and increasing the share of direct shipments to customers.

_BMI optimization_

FFG’s BMI spend for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 was 7.3% of revenue, above the
range among peers in the wider consumer sector of between 2.3% to 5.8%. Within Unilever, current
BMI spend is generally split across countries by their respective share of FFG’s total revenue, and
essentially supports the entire portfolio of brands.

The Issuer and its third-party commercial advisers have reviewed current spend practices in BMI on a
bottom-up basis and identified opportunities to optimize marketing spend practices. We intend to
reduce BMI spend as a percent of turnover through several key initiatives, including: (i) reallocation of
budget to more effective marketing channels including digital, (ii) better execution across all channels
by exploring tactical media planning levers and (iii) optimization of spend through working with more
agile, smaller agencies. In order to deliver these initiatives, we intend to make an incremental one-time
brand and marketing investment of up to €175 million in total, over the short to medium term.

_SG&A optimization_

KKR has performed a top down benchmarking exercise of SG&A overhead costs (which excludes
BMI), which accounted for 10.9% of our revenue in 2017, and a bottom-up review of organizational
design. As part of the Acquisition, FFG will set up central standalone operations for Finance, IT,
Marketing, HR, Procurement and Legal functions. This exercise would entail hiring in excess of 500
staff across key support functions. Levers to optimize the cost structure include (i) right-sizing G&A
support organization to peer efficiency benchmark level, (ii) strengthening of Customer Development
during transition and optimizing to peer efficiency level and (iii) streamlining of research and
development portfolio and local organization, including focusing on key cross-country innovation and
adding skills such as value packaging engineering.

**_Exploit positive trends in Foodservice_**

While FFG is a key player in the global retail channel with an approximately 32% share of the global
margarine & spreads category, FFG has a limited presence in the foodservice channel, as pursuing
this route-to-market channel was not previously a key focus under Unilever ownership. Operating as a
standalone business, FFG is well positioned to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities in

the global foodservice channel. Foodservice has grown faster than retail due to two main reasons. The
first is the shift towards out-of-house eating within developed markets; “eating out” grew at a compound
annual growth rate of 3% per annum between 2014 and 2016. The second is the structurally lower
exposure to changing consumer factors – consumer perceptions regarding the “naturalness” of
margarine have less of an impact on the purchasing decisions made by foodservice operators. As
typical use cases for margarine in foodservice relate to cooking and baking, where the presence of
margarine in the final product is not apparent, factors such as declining use occasions for spreading
due to declining bread consumption, misinformed perception of margarine’s health benefits and taste
issues have not impacted the foodservice channel, which has shown its resilience. There is significant
potential for FFG to increase its presence within the foodservice channel, using its retail platform to
fast-track its expansion into this segment.

FFG currently participates only in the social and commercial channel within the foodservice channel
(e.g. hotels, restaurants and institutional canteens) which is primarily a branded sub-category that
accounted for approximately 34% of the non-retail B&M category globally in 2016. The unbranded
artisanal and industrial channels, which together represented approximately 65% of the total non-retail
category globally in 2016, provide a significant and under-explored opportunity. Management believes
there is a significant opportunity to expand penetration of the foodservice channel through FFG’s
existing business infrastructure. The capacity available across FFG’s current manufacturing and supply
chain network will enable FFG to complement its retail footprint with an expanded foodservice offering,
particularly by concentrating on direct sales to the largest end users and by pursuing relationships with
selected wholesalers that have a foodservice focus. The demonstrable functional and cost benefits of
FFG’s products, including DCA’s longer shelf life and value compared with dairy products, and ability to
withstand high temperatures and acidity levels without splitting, as well as FFG’s ability to produce
allergen-free products and the products’ favorable cost comparison to butter, position the business
strongly to take advantage of this growing channel.

**_Leverage iconic brand portfolio, expertise and market position to expand into growing adjacent_**
**_categories_**

Diet and health issues are at the forefront of the global packaged foods industry. In recent years,
consumers have become increasingly conscious of what they eat, conditions such as gluten and dairy
intolerance have become more widely recognized and more people are following “flexitarian”,
vegetarian and vegan diets. There is an increasingly strong awareness of the benefits of plant-based
diets, which FFG is well placed to exploit.

Leveraging its product expertise, research and development capability and manufacturing capacity to
further expand into plant-based products and adjacent categories is a key component of FFG’s
strategy. FFG plans to build on the “free-from” diet and health trend by extending its strongest brands
into dairy-free milk and yogurt alternatives. Further expansion into alternative and sweet spread
adjacencies (including chocolate spreads), as well as plant-based dips, to appeal to higher income and
health-conscious millennial demographics, also forms a central part of FFG’s strategy and is supported
by underlying consumer consciousness of the benefits of a plant-based diet. FFG also intends to
accelerate the DCA offering, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, emphasizing the advantages
of these products over traditional dairy cream, including longer shelf life, lower cost of production,
resistance to curdling, greater stability in whipping, the potential to be allergen free, as well as other
health benefits. In addition to the expansion of FFG’s current ranges, there are opportunities in high fat
variants, ambient products and vegan products.

Target countries for adjacencies are large, growing and profitable with an easy-to-penetrate
competitive landscape and positive consumer and retailer trends. A good example is non-dairy milk,
which has been growing at around 11% per annum between 2014 and 2017 and is expected to
continue growing at a strong pace due to underlying positive demand dynamics (consumers
increasingly viewing non-dairy as a more “mainstream” proposition). Chilled dips and other adjacent
categories have demonstrated similar strong growth potential. Due to its research and development
capabilities, FFG is well positioned to take advantage of consumer appetite for alternative products in
the packaged food and non-dairy space.


11


-----

To tap into the adjacencies segments, FFG will both leverage its existing brand portfolio and develop
new brands. For example, Flora Pro Activ is already seen as a functional health-focused brand, which
offers significant brand expansion opportunities—the brand is already present in the Netherlands in the
non-dairy yogurt adjacent category, hence this provides a platform for growth. Other brands such as
Brummel and Brown are active in products based on dairy yogurt, hence expanding into non-dairy
yogurts, creams and drinks would also be achievable.

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

FFG reported on a preliminary basis that its turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was
€691.2 million (this includes turnover in Portugal of €11.6 million), which is 6.0% or €44.3 million lower
than FFG’s turnover of €735.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This was primarily
driven by foreign exchange effects. Adjusted for constant currency, USG year on year performance
was -0.3% which shows the continuing positive momentum of the business. Developed Markets USG
of -0.7% was partially offset by Emerging Markets USG of +1.3%. Normalized EBITDA was
€165.3 million, which was €3.0 million, or 1.8%, lower than FFG’s Normalized EBITDA of
€168.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Savings in Branding and Marketing
Investment and other overhead costs contributed to increase FFG’s Normalized EBITDA Margin for the
three months ended March 31, 2018 by 102 basis points to 23.9% from 22.9% for the three months
ended March 31, 2017.

This information is based solely on preliminary internal information used by management and is based
on assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties. Our actual consolidated financial results for
the three months ended March 31, 2018 may differ from our preliminary calculated results and remain
subject to our normal review process, including the adjustments required to present this accounting
information in accordance with IFRS. Those procedures have not been completed. Accordingly, these
results may change and those changes may be material. We caution that the foregoing information has
not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors and should not be regarded as an indication,
forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding our financial performance for the three
months ended March 31, 2018.

**_Executive Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Management Transition_**

On April 11, 2018, KKR announced that it intends to appoint David Haines as Executive Chairman of
the Global Spreads Business, subject to and effective from the successful completion of the
Acquisition.

Mr Haines was previously Chairman and CEO of Grohe Group, and subsequently CEO of Lixil Water
Technology Group. At Grohe, Mr. Haines led the complete transformation of the business over a 10
year period. He joined Grohe from Vodafone, where he served as the company’s first Global Marketing
Director, building Vodafone into a successful, top ten global brand within three years and across
multiple markets. Prior to this Mr. Haines was Deputy Division President of The Coca Cola Company in
Germany, and for 10 years a General Manager for Mars across different European markets. He began
his career in Germany at Lever Sunlicht, and holds a first class Honours degree from the University of
Greenwich in London.

We have also agreed with Jesper Andersen to take over the role of Chief Financial Officer upon
completion of the Acquisition. Mr. Andersen is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Beiersdorf AG,
the maker of Nivea and other skin care products. Prior to joining Beiersdorf, Mr. Andersen held a
number of roles including more than two decades of consumer experience at Colgate-Palmolive in a
number of roles in Europe, Asia and North America. Mr. Andersen holds a Masters Degree in
Economics and Business Administration from Aarhus school of Business in Denmark. We intend that
our current group CFO, Javier Tena, will continue with FFG in a senior finance role working with Mr.
Andersen, although this has not yet been finalized.

Separately, Nicolas Liabeuf, the Chief Executive Officer of FFG, has informed us that he intends to
step down as CEO after the completion of the Acquisition. It is anticipated that Mr Liabeuf will assist


12


-----

Mr Haines in assuming leadership of FFG, and remain engaged for a period after completion of the
Acquisition to assist in a smooth transition.

Javier Huerta, our Chief Supply Officer, has notified us of his resignation from this role, and we intend
to commence a search for a suitably qualified replacement.

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a private company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) on December 12, 2017, for the purpose of
facilitating the Acquisition and facilitating the financing of the Acquisition (as well as subsequent
financings), having its official seat (statutaire zetel) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and its office at
Overschiestraat 61-5 hoog, 1062 XD Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Issuer is registered with the
Dutch Trade Register of the Chamber of Commerce under number the number 70282900.

**The Acquisition**

On December 15, 2017, Bidco, an indirect subsidiary of the Issuer, issued a final, binding, irrevocable
and fully financed offer letter (the “Offer Letter”) to Unilever providing for the acquisition (the
“Acquisition”) of all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the entities comprising FFG and the
acquisition of certain assets (and the assumption of related liabilities) associated with FFG’s business,
for a total consideration of €6,825 million on a cash-free, debt-free basis, subject to customary
completion accounts adjustments and payments in respect of cash-balances, intra-group financing
receivables, third-party indebtedness, intra-group financing payables and working capital. The Offer
Letter cannot be withdrawn by Bidco and remains open for acceptance until the earlier of: (i) five
business days after completion of certain works council consultation processes; and (ii) June 15, 2018,
which is the estimated date for completion of these works council consultations (unless otherwise
agreed by the parties). The Offer Letter may be extended by written agreement of the parties thereto
for up to three additional months to provide extra time to complete the works council consultation
processes. Once the offer has been accepted by Unilever, the parties will then execute the Acquisition
Agreement.

The Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions. Depending on the timing of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent to closing (including regulatory approvals and works council approvals), we
expect to complete the Acquisition in the third quarter of 2018. The terms of the Acquisition Agreement
do not provide for completion of the Acquisition any earlier than July 2, 2018.

The total Acquisition consideration, including the purchase price paid for the Acquisition as well as
certain related costs, fees and expenses, will be financed on the Completion Date using:

    - the Shareholder Contribution, in an amount of €1,974 million;

    - borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities, in an aggregate principal amount of
€3,954 million (or its currency equivalent);

    - the gross proceeds of this offering of the Notes.

We have also agreed to pay Unilever in cash on or after the Completion Date an amount to settle
FFG’s working capital position, and we expect to finance this payment with temporary drawings under
the Revolving Credit Facility. We do not currently have a precise figure for this payment, but we
estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This payment arises because we have
agreed to leave behind in Unilever (i) receivables associated with sales of FFG’s products prior to the
Completion Date and (ii) payables associated with raw materials received by FFG prior to the
Completion Date, and have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing the average net
negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials
and finished products conveyed with the business on the Completion Date. These arrangements are
subject to change prior to the Completion Date. We expect our net working capital position to return to
a net negative position and largely normalize within 120 days after such payment is made (and we
expect to repay the Revolving Credit Facility drawing as our working capital position normalizes).

This Offering Memorandum contains certain forecasts and estimates, among others, relating to cost
reductions and other benefits expected to result from the separation from Unilever as well as
information with respect to costs to implement the Acquisition and separation. The estimates presented
in this Offering Memorandum are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the
information available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions
used in estimating the synergies arising from the Acquisition and separation from Unilever are
inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
presented in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

**The Transactions**

    - the making of the Shareholder Contribution;

    - the issuance by the Issuer of €1,050 million (equivalent) aggregate principal amount of Notes
offered hereby;

    - the entry into the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (and the transactions contemplated
therein) and the use of proceeds from the borrowings thereunder;

    - the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Offer Letter and the Acquisition
Agreement; and

in the credit balance in each of the Deposit Accounts to the Trustee. The release of the funds credited
to the Deposit Accounts and the consummation of the Acquisition will be subject to the satisfaction of
certain conditions. In the event that (i) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the
Longstop Date, (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated on
or prior to the Longstop Date, (iii) the Offer Letter or, if executed, the Acquisition Agreement,
terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date, or (iv) upon the occurrence of certain other
events, the Issuer will redeem the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such
Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to (but not
including) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). See “Use of
_Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description of the Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory_
_Redemption” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Offering—The proceeds of the offering of the_
_Notes will be placed in deposit account and if the Deposit Accounts release conditions are not_
_satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the_
_return you expect on the Notes. No third party escrow agent shall control the Deposit Accounts.”_

(1) Entities advised by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. indirectly hold 100% of the shareholding of the Issuer,
with management expected to invest through a management participation plan (see “Management—Director and Executive
_Officer Compensation”). The Issuer is indirectly controlled by KKR._
(2) The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other existing and
future senior debt of the Issuer. We intend to use the gross proceeds of the Offering, together with the borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facilities and the Shareholder Contribution, to (i) finance the Acquisition and (ii) pay costs, expenses and fees
in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.” Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the
Issue Date, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Deposit Accounts, which are segregated and
controlled by the Issuer to hold such amounts pending the consummation of the Acquisition. On or about the Issue Date, the
Issuer will assign as security its rights, title and interest in the credit balance in each of the Deposit Accounts to the Trustee.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Offering— If the Deposit Release Conditions are not satisfied, the Issuer will be
_required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes. No third party_
_escrow agent shall control the Deposit Accounts.”_
(3) The entities in the Restricted Group are subject to the covenants in the Indenture and the covenants in the Senior Facilities
Agreement. Immediately after the consummation of the Transactions, all of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will be restricted
subsidiaries.
(4) The Senior Credit Facilities comprise (a) the Senior Term Facilities, consisting of (i) a euro tranche in aggregate principal
amount of €2,000 million; (ii) a U.S. dollar tranche in aggregate principal amount of $875 million; (iii) a Polish złoty tranche in
aggregate principal amount of €475 million (equivalent); and (iv) a pound sterling tranche in aggregate principal amount of
£445 million; plus €300 million (equivalent), each of which we expect will be drawn on or about the consummation of the
Acquisition, and (b) the Revolving Credit Facility providing for revolving commitments of €700 million. As of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, the Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn, and the Revolving Credit Facility may only be drawn after a
drawdown of the Senior Term Facilities has occurred. On or about the Completion Date, we expect to draw an amount under
the Revolving Credit Facility for a working capital reimbursement to Unilever. We do not currently have a figure for this
payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is subject to change prior to the
Completion Date. We expect to repay this as our working capital position normalizes. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—Following the separation, we will experience a temporary_
_increase in our working capital needs” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” For a description of the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, see_
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”

-----

(5) A Proceeds Loan in respect of the proceeds of the Notes will be made by the Issuer to Midco following the release of such
proceeds from the Deposit Accounts. The proceeds of the Proceeds Loan are expected to be used to finance a portion of
the Acquisition and certain expenses relating to the Transactions, including the Offering, as set forth under “Use of
_Proceeds.” The Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan will be pledged in favor of the Security Agent and will comprise part_
of the Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Security.”
(6) The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Initial Guarantors and, assuming the Completion Date
occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, as soon
as reasonably practicable by the Target Guarantors after the Completion Date but in any case no later than 120 days from
the Completion Date. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to
certain contractual and legal limitations, including the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The Guarantees may be released under certain_
circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.” As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s
business in the Target Guarantor markets accounted for 43% of FFG’s turnover, 46% of FFG’s Normalized EBITDA and
47% of FFG’s consolidated total assets, excluding goodwill, intangible assets, investments, deferred taxes and intercompany assets. Only certain subsidiaries organized or incorporated in the Netherlands, Germany, New York, Delaware and
England will guarantee the obligations under the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed by each of the entities that will
guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, and under the terms of the Indenture will indirectly benefit from the
minimum guarantor provisions set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, as amended or restated from time to time.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.” On or about the
Issue Date, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the security granted by the Issuer in
favor of the Security Agent over (a) all of the issued Capital Stock in Midco held by the Issuer and (b) any present and future
receivables under any material structural intercompany loan provided by the Issuer to Midco (which will include on or about
the Completion Date, any receivables owed to the Issuer by Midco under the Proceeds Loan) will extend to secure the
Notes on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. The security interests over the Collateral may be
released under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” The Guarantees and
security interests will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes,
_the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees will be subordinated to our existing and future senior debt and the_
_Notes are subject to restrictions on payment and enforcement,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_
(7) As of December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes
would have had an immaterial amount of third-party financial indebtedness.
(8) As of the Issue Date, U.S. Midco will be owned by the Issuer. However, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Completion Date, we expect to make U.S. Midco a wholly owned subsidiary of Midco.

FFG’s turnover, 46% of FFG’s Normalized EBITDA and 47% of
FFG’s consolidated total assets, excluding goodwill, intangible
assets, investments, deferred taxes and inter-company assets.

The Guarantees will be subject to certain contractual and legal
limitations, and may be released without the consent of holders
of the Notes under certain circumstances. See “Description of
_the_ _Notes—Guarantees”_ _and_ _“Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_
_Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Notes will be guaranteed by each of the entities that will
guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, and under
the terms of the Indenture will indirectly benefit from the
minimum guarantor provisions set forth in the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, as amended or restated from time to time.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior
_Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.”_

As at December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the issue and
sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as
described under “Use of Proceeds,” on a consolidated basis,
the Non-Guarantors would have had less than €9 million
indebtedness outstanding.

**Ranking of the Guarantees . . . . . . .** The Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

                         - be a senior subordinated obligation of that Guarantor;

                         - be subordinated in right of payment to all of the Guarantors’
existing and future senior indebtedness, including any

indebtedness under or in respect of the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations;

                         - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and
future senior subordinated indebtedness of that Guarantor;

                         - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
obligations of that Guarantor that are expressly
subordinated to such Guarantee;

                         - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by liens
senior to the liens securing that Guarantor’s Guarantee or
secured with property or assets that do not secure that
Guarantor’s Guarantee, including indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, to the extent of the value
of the property and assets securing such indebtedness;

                         - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness, including obligations to trade creditors of
subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not Guarantors; and

                         - be subject to the guarantee limitations described herein and
under “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, including payment blockage upon a senior default
and standstills on enforcement. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The_
_Guarantees will be subordinated to our existing and future_
_senior debt and the Notes are subject to restrictions on_
_payment_ _and_ _enforcement,”_ _and_ “Description _of_ _Certain_
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the
Issue Date, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds from the
offering of the Euro Notes into the Euro Notes Deposit Account,
and the gross proceeds from the offering of the Dollar Notes
into the Dollar Notes Deposit Account, each of which shall be
segregated and controlled by the Issuer, to hold such amounts
pending the consummation of the Acquisition. On or about the
Issue Date, the Issuer will assign as security its rights, title and
interest in the credit balance in each of the Deposit Accounts to
the Trustee. See _“Risk_ _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_
_Offering—If the Deposit Release Conditions are not satisfied,_
_the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means_
_that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes. No_
_third party escrow agent shall control the Deposit Accounts.”_

On or about the Issue Date, to the extent legally possible and
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the security granted
by the Issuer in favor of the Security Agent over (a) all of the
issued Capital Stock in Midco held by the Issuer and (b) any
present and future receivables under any material structural
intercompany loan provided by the Issuer to Midco (which will
include from on or about the Completion Date, any receivables
owed to the Issuer by Midco under the Proceeds Loan) will
extend to secure the Notes on the basis and priority set out in
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The security interests over the Collateral may be released
under certain circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

**Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with
respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or
deduction for or on account of taxes unless required by law. If
the Issuer or Guarantors are required by law to withhold or
deduct amounts for or on account of tax imposed or levied by a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction with respect to a payment to the
holders of Notes, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will,
subject to certain exceptions, pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of the
Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than the
amount that they would have received in the absence of the
withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.”_

**Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** At any time prior to, 2021, the Issuer may on any one or
more occasions redeem all or a part of the Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes redeemed, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium
(described in this Offering Memorandum) and accrued and
unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any.

At any time prior to, 2021, the Issuer will be entitled at
its option, on one or more occasions, to redeem the Dollar
Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes (including
additional dollar notes, if any) with the net cash proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of
the principal amount outstanding in respect of the Dollar Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any,
so long as each such redemption occurs within 180 days after
the date of the relevant equity offering and provided that at
least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
Dollar Notes (not including any additional notes) remains
outstanding after the redemption.

At any time prior to, 2021, the Issuer will be entitled at
its option, on one or more occasions, to redeem the Euro Notes
in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes (including
additional euro notes, if any) with the net cash proceeds from
certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of
the principal amount outstanding in respect of the Euro Notes,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, if any,
so long as each such redemption occurs within 180 days after
the date of the relevant equity offering and provided that at
least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
Euro Notes (not including any additional notes) remains
outstanding after the redemption.

In addition, prior to, 2021, the Issuer may, during each
twelve month period commencing on the Issue Date, redeem
up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of
Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any
additional Notes of the applicable series) at a redemption price


21


-----

equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest.

At any time on or after, 2021, the Issuer will be entitled
at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the
redemption prices set forth under the caption “Description of
_the Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid_
interest to the redemption date, if any.

In connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then
outstanding of a series of Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw Notes of such series in such tender offer and the
Issuer purchases all of the Notes of such series validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer will
have the right, upon prior notice to the Holders of the relevant
series of Notes, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the
price paid to each other Holder of such series of Notes in such
tender offer (other than any incentive payment for early
tenders), plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, thereon, to, but not including, the redemption date.

**Optional** **Redemption** **for** **Tax**
**Reasons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the
Issuer may redeem the relevant series of the Notes in whole,
but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of
the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Deposit** **of** **Proceeds;** **Special**
**Mandatory Redemption . . . . . . . .** Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the
Issue Date, the Issuer will deposit the gross proceeds from the
offering of the Euro Notes into the Euro Notes Deposit Account,
and the gross proceeds from the offering of the Dollar Notes
into the Dollar Notes Deposit Account, each of which shall be
segregated and controlled by the Issuer, to hold such amounts
pending the consummation of the Acquisition. On or about the
Issue Date, the Issuer will assign as security its rights, title and
interest in the credit balance in each of the Deposit Accounts to
the Trustee. The release of the funds credited to the Deposit
Accounts and the consummation of the Acquisition will be
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In the event
that, (i) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to
the Longstop Date, (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Issuer,
the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to Longstop
Date, (iii) the Offer Letter or, if executed, the Acquisition
Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop
Date, or (iv) certain other events occur, the Issuer will redeem
the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
such Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to (but not including) the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein)
(subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment

date). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Offering—The
_proceeds of the offering will be placed in deposit accounts and_
_if the Deposit Release Conditions are not satisfied, the Issuer_
_will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you_
_may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes. No third_
_party escrow agent shall control the deposit accounts” and_
“Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Deposit_ _of_ _Proceeds;_ _Special_
_Mandatory Redemption.”_

Once the Issuer determines that the conditions to the release of
the proceeds from the Deposit Accounts will be satisfied
promptly following the release of the deposited funds, the
deposited funds may be released to the Issuer and utilized as
described in “Use of Proceeds” and “Description of the Notes—
_Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and the_
Deposit Account Charges will be released.

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of
control, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase the
Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. However, a
change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a
specified consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded in
connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control.”_

**Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture contains covenants that limit the ability of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

                         - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain
preferred stock;

                         - pay dividends or make other distributions or investments or
purchase or reduce or redeem the Issuer’s stock;

                         - make investments or other restricted payments;

                         - enter into agreements that restrict the Issuer’s restricted
subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

                         - impair security interests; or

                         - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or
substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s assets.

Each of these covenants is subject to significant exceptions

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following tables summarize the historical combined carve-out financial data as at the dates and for_
_the periods indicated. The financial data has been derived from the audited combined carve-out_
_Financial Statements of FFG for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. See_
_“Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”_

_The combined carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared by combining and carving-out the_
_assets, liabilities, income and expenses that management have determined relate to Unilever’s_
_spreads business. Those amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the_
_Unilever entities running spreads activities, which also include allocations and recharges by Unilever of_
_indirect central costs and general corporate expenses. The combined carve-out Financial Statements_
_include a cash flow statement showing movement arising from operating, investing and financing_
_activities irrespective of Unilever’s centralized approach to cash management and financing and_
_disclose the cumulative investment of Unilever in the spreads business as net parent (deficit) /_
_investment._

_The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to Unilever’s_
_spreads business include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the_
_spreads business, together with an allocation of the items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments_
_and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out_
_Financial Statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable._

_The Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect Unilever’s spreads business financial position,_
_results of operations or cash flows had the spreads business been a separate entity, or the future_
_results of the spreads business as it will exist upon the completion of the separation from Unilever. See_
_“Presentation of Financials and Other Information.”_

_This summary historical combined-consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the_
_sections entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information,”_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the_
_combined carve-out Financial Statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum._

(1) Underlying free cash flow, EBITDA before exceptional bonus and share-based payments, Normalized EBITDA and pro
_forma Normalized EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider any of them in isolation. Some of_
these limitations include the following: (i) they do not reflect capital expenditures, future requirements for capital
expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital
needs; (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments
on debt; and (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such
replacements. Our presentation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA has additional limitations as an analytical tool. For
example, pro forma Normalized EBITDA does not reflect expenses and capital expenditures that FFG expects to incur to
transition to a stand-alone business, which we currently estimate will be approximately €200 million in transition-related
expenses and one time expenditures, including approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs that
we expect FFG to incur as it transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform,
and approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as certain manufacturing and management functions are
separated from Unilever and relocated (before any offsetting gains from land sales are considered). The substantial majority
of these expenses are expected to be incurred over an extended period, up to an including the year ending December 31,
2019. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures.”

(a) In connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint venture entity
(Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG. Accordingly. Portuguese joint venture
adjustment (i) adds back the share of net profit of Portuguese joint venture included in FFG’s Net profit (2015:
€3.3 million, 2016: €3.3 million, 2017: €3.7 million), which item is deducted when reconciling Cash flow from operating

activities to Net profit, (ii) adds in the share of net profit of Portuguese joint venture attributed to the non-Unilever-owned
portion of that business (2015: €2.7 million, 2016: €2.7 million, 2017: €3.0 million) which will be acquired by FFG in
connection with the Transactions, and (iii) adds in the entire net finance costs, taxation, depreciation and amortization of
that business (2015: €2.0 million, 2016: €2.1 million, 2017: €2.5 million).
(b) Exceptional bonus and share-based payment adjustment arises because, in part due to the Acquisition, Unilever’s
spreads business paid incentive and share-based compensation to its employees at rates materially higher than the
rates used in other areas of Unilever’s business in the year ended December 31, 2017, which were also higher than the
rates used across Unilever’s global business in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. The adjustment amount
reflects the portion of the bonus and share-based payments attributable to the amount by which the rate used in the
spreads business exceeded the average rate used across the rest of Unilever’s businesses in the year ended
December 31, 2017.
(3) Underlying free cash conversion ratio for any period represents Underlying free cash flow for that period divided by

a) Net profit in Developed Markets was €385.6 million, €362.0 million and €483.9 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Net profit in Emerging Markets was €68.0 million, €60.5 million and €81.2 million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
b) Taxation in Developed Markets was €53.8 million, €111.3 million and €49.7 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Taxation in Emerging Markets was €37.2 million, €31.5 million and €35.0 million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
c) Net interest cost in Developed Markets was €3.1 million, €8.5 million and €8.5 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. There was no net interest cost in Emerging Markets for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
d) Due to the carve-out nature of the Financial Statements, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation
of intangible assets is divided between (i) direct depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of
intangible assets, which relates to the specific assets which are included in the balance sheet of the carved-out
business, and (ii) allocated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets, which
are allocated charges relating to shared factory buildings and shared software assets utilized by FFG but not included
on the balance sheet of the combined carve-out financial statements.

e) Exceptional bonus and share-based payment adjustment arises because, in part due to the Acquisition, Unilever’s
spreads business paid incentive and share-based compensation to its employees at rates materially higher than the
rates used in other areas of Unilever’s business in the year ended December 31, 2017, which were also higher than the
rates used across Unilever’s global business in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. The adjustment amount
reflects the portion of the bonus and share-based payments attributable to the amount by which the rate used in the
spreads business exceeded the average rate used across the rest of Unilever’s businesses in the year ended
December 31, 2017.
f) Non-underlying items are comprised of restructuring costs in each period presented. These restructuring costs
principally relate to costs directly incurred within FFG’s business, but also include an amount of €1.6 million allocated
from Unilever in 2017 (2016: €4.5 million, 2015: €9.2 million), Restructuring costs incurred in 2015 include €49.8 million
arising from the consolidation of multiple U.S. factories into one facility at New Century, Kansas. In 2015, an additional
€13.4 million was incurred in relation to Project Eagle, the set up of the separate BCS structure. In 2016, €14 million of
costs were incurred completing Project Eagle and restructuring of Global Spreads Marketing and R&D teams.
Non-underlying items in Developed Markets (both direct and allocated) were -€83.6 million, -€21.3 million and
€1.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Non-underlying items in Emerging
Markets (both direct and allocated) were -€5.6 million, -€7.3 million and -€7.7 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017
g) In connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint venture entity
(Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG. Accordingly, the Portuguese Joint Venture
adjustment adds in (i) the share of net profit of Portuguese joint venture attributed to the non-Unilever-owned portion of
that business (2015: €2.7 million, 2016: €2.7 million, 2017: €3.0 million) and (ii) the entire net finance costs, taxation,
depreciation and amortization of that business (2015: €3.7 million, 2016: €3.9 million, 2017: €4.5 million). The Portugal
joint venture adjustment relates entirely to operations in Developed Markets.
h) Finance costs related to pensions and similar obligations for Developed Markets were €nil for each of the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Finance costs for related to pensions and similar obligations for Emerging Markets
were €0.2 million, €0.1 million and €0.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

(i) Net savings on SG&A overheads reflects the difference between net costs for overheads incurred by FFG
(including the Portugal business) as part of Unilever, including allocated costs, and the expected costs of providing
these services on a stand-alone basis. These allocated costs, amounting to €293 million (Developed Markets:
€220 million (after deducting €22 million of the exceptional bonus and share-based payments attributable to
overheads), Emerging Markets: €73 million), included costs with respect to customer development, marketing
support, research and development, finance, IT, HR, general management, workplace services, legal, share-based
payments, and other overhead costs.
We estimate that FFG would have incurred approximately €215 million in SG&A overhead expenses (Developed
Markets: €177 million, Emerging Markets: €37 million) had it fully transitioned to providing such services internally
or contracted with third-party services providers and ceased using services provided by Unilever. This includes a
reduction of €64 million in overall costs, plus the shifting of approximately €14 million of internal overhead costs
(primarily in customer development and marketing support costs) to trade terms with distributors, which we expect
to occur in connection with the increased utilization of third-party distributors discussed below in note (iv). Net
allocated costs for SG&A overheads provided by Unilever in the year ended December 31, 2017, also included
non-underlying restructuring costs of €5.9 million discussed above at note f which are not included in our standalone cost base given their expected non-recurring nature. Management’s estimated annual stand-alone SG&A
overhead expenses consist of the following estimated amounts:

    - €59.3 million in customer development costs, related to sales personnel to manage customer relationships, sales
agency fees in markets where certain customer relationship functions are or will be outsourced, and sales support
costs, such as car lease expenses.

    - €30.0 million in marketing support costs, related to the global and local coordination of communications,
advertising, brand strategy and lobbying.

    - €30.2 million in research and development costs, related to the development of manufacturing techniques, the
formulation of new products which can be produced with existing manufacturing techniques, adapting and testing
products in local markets before release, and the monitoring and implementation of food standards and safety
guidelines.

    - €26.9 million in finance department costs, related to functions such as financial reporting and budgeting,
performance monitoring, tax strategy and compliance, risk management, insurance, contract management, supply
chain finance management, treasury services, cash management and working capital management.

    - €23.7 million in IT costs, related to the main business processes (apart from supply chain IT costs, which are
accounted for in supply chain costs). FFG’s current IT environment is fully shared with Unilever, which will only be
available for a limited time after the completion of the Acquisition pursuant to a TSA. FFG has developed plans to
transition to a fully independent IT environment as a stand-alone business; however, these plans are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—As FFG
_builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, it may incur substantial_
_additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.”_

    - €9.2 million in HR costs, related to central and local support of payroll and benefits systems, provision of training,
as well as other traditional HR functions.

    - €8.3 million for workplace services, related to property management, facilities management and travel services, as
well as rent, utility and other operating costs for office space.

    - €13.7 million across general management, legal and other corporate and local costs.

    - €13.3 million incentive costs for key management and directors.
After the Completion Date, FFG will not incur any allocated expenses from Unilever. FFG has engaged several
consultants and industry experts who have assisted it in the analysis of its anticipated stand-alone cost structure.
During a transition period of up to 18 months following the Completion Date, FFG will continue to receive certain
services from Unilever under the TSAs for which FFG will incur direct costs, as discussed under “Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” The TSAs also contain 6 month extension options for IT services
and shared services which FFG may exercise. The stand-alone cost structure described in this note (i) is reflected
in the pricing of such services under the TSAs. In addition, for up to three years after the consummation of the
Acquisition, FFG and Unilever will be party to certain co-packing and reverse co-packing agreements, which stand
apart from the TSAs.
(ii) Supply chain adjustment relates primarily to management’s estimate of cost savings expected to be achieved from
the replacement of overhead allocations from Unilever with bottom-up stand-alone costs, including (a) a raw
material cost adjustment to remove central charges, (b) a distribution cost adjustment, (c) savings on local labor
costs on a stand-alone basis, and (d) a production cost adjustment relating to network optimization plans and the
replacement of allocated production overheads with stand-alone costs. Supply chain adjustments allocated to

-----

Developed Markets amount to €26.4 million in the aggregate, while those allocated to Emerging Markets amount to
€7.1 million in the aggregate.
(iii) Branding and Marketing Investment adjustment primarily relates to management’s estimate of cost savings
expected to be achieved from (a) the elimination of €8 million of global marketing costs allocated by Unilever (such
as those related to group-wide campaign costs and shared marketing activities) with respect to markets which will
remain on a direct sales model and their replacement with brand and marketing investments planned on an FFG
stand-alone basis and (b) an additional €9 million of estimated expected reductions in annual brand and marketing
investment associated with the increased utilization of third-party distributors discussed below in note (iv). Branding
and Marketing Investment adjustments allocated to Developed Markets amount to €9.8 million in the aggregate,
while those allocated to Emerging Markets amount to €7.6 million in the aggregate.
The Branding and Marketing Investment adjustment does not account for the one-time exceptional branding and
marketing expenditures which FFG expects to make to re-position itself and its brands over an extended period
after completion of the Acquisition, comprising an estimated €175 million of costs spread through the years up to
December 31, 2021, which is incremental to the regular recurring branding and marketing investment of the
business. See See “Summary—Strategy—Accelerate clearly defined initiatives to stabilize Developed Markets”.
(iv) Distributor model adjustment comprises management’s estimate of the direct cost impact of an expected increase
in the use of third-party distributers as a result of FFG’s separation from Unilever; management believes that the
increase in the use of third-part distributors will have an overall neutral effect on Normalized EBITDA because of
offsetting factors identified below.
In several of our smaller markets (currently projected at 32) served through a direct sales model under Unilever, we
expect FFG to transition to the use of third-party distributors following the separation from Unilever. This transition
is expected to result in a €22 million annual increase in costs related to trade terms and concessions to third-party
distributors, who are expected to provide certain logistical, branding and marketing support. In addition, we expect
that certain markets which will remain predominantly on a direct sales model after the separation from Unilever
(such as Hungary and Austria) will nevertheless experience a limited increase in the use of third-party distributors,
creating an additional €4 million in annual costs. Across Developed Markets, the total annual costs are expected to
amount to €9.6 million, while across Emerging Markets, the total annual costs are expected to amount to
€16.6 million.
The additional services to be provided by third-party distributors are, however, expected to allow FFG to (a) reduce
branding and marketing investment in respect of those markets by €9 million annually, the impact of which is
reflected in Branding and Marketing Investment adjustment and discussed above in note (iii), as well as (b) reduce
overhead costs related to the existing internal provision of such services by €14 million annually, the impact of
which is reflected in net savings on SG&A overheads and discussed above in note (i). Accordingly, the switch to a
distributor model in these countries is expected to have an overall neutral effect on Normalized EBITDA.
(v) Depreciation and amortisiation adjustment arises because net savings on SG&A overheads, described above in
note (i), and supply chain adjustment, described above in note (ii), were each calculated with reference to allocated
Unilever operating costs which included allocated depreciation and amortisation charges. For purposes of
calculating a Normalized EBITDA metric, however, management believes that it is inappropriate to include
depreciation and amortisation cost components. Accordingly, €15.3 million of depreciation and amortisation
attributable to supply chain is backed-out, and €8.0 million of depreciation and amortisation attributable to overhead
costs is backed-out. This entire adjustment is attributed to Developed Markets.
j) Share-based payments adjustment reflects estimated cost savings from the planned elimination of share-based
incentive costs for key management and directors which are at present included in the stand-alone operating model
(described as incentive costs for key management and directors at note i) with the non-cash management incentive
plan described under the caption “Management—Director and Executive Officer Compensation.” The share-based
payments adjustment is allocated €10.5 million to Developed Markets and €2.8 million to Emerging Markets.
k) Implemented 2017 savings initiatives reflects the full year effect of several projects that were implemented in 2017,
including procurement projects across a range of inputs, such as raw materials and packaging (€26.2 million) and
savings in supply chain through diverse initiatives such as negotiations with freight carriers, network and labor
optimization, energy management and fat reduction initiatives in Europe (€1.8 million). Implemented 2017 savings
initiatives in Developed Markets amount to €23.0 million in the aggregate, while those in Emerging Markets amount to
€6.1 million in the aggregate.
l) Completion Date SG&A cost savings represent additional operating cost and efficiency opportunities in SG&A, beyond
the carve-out net savings on SG&A overheads discussed above in note i, which the Issuer believes can and will be
promptly implemented upon the consummation of the Acquisition. These mainly represent cost avoidance via rightsizing
of the support functions (including finance, IT, HR) and other general and administrative costs through increased
concentration of activities in central or regional hubs. This adjustment also accounts for the opportunity to reduce
selectively research and development costs (which management believes are higher than those of industry peers) by
moving to a more centralized organization relative to the structure currently in place under Unilever. These savings will
be achieved by hiring people only for the functions needed in the new streamlined organization.
The Completion Date SG&A cost savings form a subset of management’s longer-term plans, developed in close
consultation with KKR and leading industry consultants, to implement approximately €200 million of cost savings and
efficiencies across raw materials and procurement, manufacturing, supply chain, marketing and SG&A after
consummation of the Acquisition. The realization of some of these longer-term cost saving plans (but not the
Completion Date SG&A cost savings) is expected to require the incurrence of approximately €45 million to €50 million
of non-recurring restructuring and related costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by December 31,
2020). See “Summary—Strategy—Realize significant cost savings opportunity.” Completion Date SG&A cost savings in
Developed Markets amount to €21.5 million in the aggregate, while those in Emerging Markets amount to €5.6 million in
the aggregate.

m) Impact of commodity prices is an add-back to reflect the impact of declining prices of edible commodity oils (including
sunflower, rapeseed, palm and soybean based oils) between the first and second halves of 2017 and management’s
expectation that the prices of such commodities during the second half of 2017 are more representative for the business
on a go forward basis. The identified savings reflects the incremental Normalized EBITDA that would have been
generated during the period if the average prices of such commodities during all of 2017 were the same as the average
prices during the second half of 2017. These commodity prices trended downward during the second half of 2017, as
well as over the last three years, and management expects them to continue to trade at similar levels for the
foreseeable future. Impact of commodity prices in Developed Markets amounts to €5.5 million, while in Emerging
Markets it amounts to €1.5 million.

**Other adjustments** **(5.8)**

(i) Phasing adjustment to implemented 2017 savings initiatives reflects the fact that €1.1 million of the savings
initiatives described in note k had limited evidence of full implementation in 2017. This entire adjustment is
attributed to Emerging Markets.
(ii) Supply chain depreciation adjustment reflects an add-back of €5.9 million of depreciation costs attributable
principally to packaging molds in the U.S. which are recorded within supply chain costs. This entire adjustment is
attributed to Developed Markets.
(iii) Pensions adjustment reflects estimated additional costs of providing pension benefits to employees not included in
the stand-alone operating SG&A model discussed above at note i. The pensions adjustment is allocated
€2.8 million to Developed Markets and €0.7 million to Emerging Markets.
(iv) Additional overhead savings consists of additional savings on R&D employee and central costs which management
believes can be promptly achieved after the Completion Date which are not otherwise reflected in pro forma
Normalized EBITDA. Additional overhead savings are allocated €6.5 million to Developed Markets and €1.7 million
to Emerging Markets.
(v) Stand-alone insurance adjustment reflects estimated additional insurance expected to be incurred after the
separation from Unilever that are not included in the stand-alone operating model described above in note (i). The
stand-alone insurance adjustment is allocated €3.3 million to Developed Markets and €0.9 million to Emerging
Markets.
(vi) Dis-synergies adjustment reflects additional costs associated with the loss of scale and bargaining power that will
be caused by the separation from Unilever, including with respect to branding and marketing costs (€4.6 million)
and supply chain costs (€3.3 million) The dis-synergies adjustment is allocated €6.3 million to Developed Markets
and €1.6 million to Emerging Markets.
(vii) Wage inflation adjustment reflects the application of a blended inflation rate of 1.9% to the costs set forth in the
stand-alone operating SG&A model described above in note (i), which is applied due to the fact that the model was
developed using 2016 cost data. The wage inflation adjustment is allocated €3.4 million to Developed Markets and
€0.9 million to Emerging Markets.
(viii) Legacy credit facility cost adjustment reflects commitment fees in respect of a revolving credit facility that will no
longer exist in the business after the consummation of the Transactions. The legacy credit facility cost adjustment
is allocated €0.9 million to Developed Markets and €0.2 million to Emerging Markets.
o) Our presentation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA has additional limitations as an analytical tool. For example, pro
_forma Normalized EBITDA does not reflect expenses and capital expenditures that FFG expects to incur to transition to_
a stand-alone business, which we currently estimate will be approximately €200 million in transition-related expenses
and one time expenditures, including approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs that we
expect FFG to incur as it transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform,
and approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as certain manufacturing and management functions
are separated from Unilever and relocated (before any offsetting gains from land sales are considered). The substantial
majority of these expenses are expected to be incurred over an extended period, up to an including the year ending
December 31, 2019.
(5) Normalized EBITDA margin for any given region represents Normalized EBITDA for that region divided by turnover for that
region, expressed as a percentage.
(6) Pro forma Normalized EBITDA margin for any given region represents pro forma Normalized EBITDA for that region divided
by turnover for that region after deducting the Distributor model adjustment applicable for that region (see note i to footnote
4, above), expressed as a percentage.
(7) Pro forma cash and cash equivalents represents our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017, on an as
adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, as set forth in “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds”.

(8) Pro forma net senior secured debt represents the aggregate principal amount of our senior secured debt as of December 31,
2017, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, as set forth in “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds”
(including (i) the borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and (ii) the drawing of an amount under the Revolving Credit
Facility on or about the Completion Date in respect of Acquisition-related short-term borrowings for a working capital
payment to Unilever), less pro forma cash and cash equivalents. We do not currently have a figure for the working capital
payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is subject to change prior to the
Completion Date. For purposes of our pro forma calculations we have assumed that this payment will be €400 million.
(9) Pro forma net senior secured debt (net of Acquisition-related short-term borrowings for working capital reimbursement)
represents the aggregate principal amount of our senior secured debt as of December 31, 2017, on an as adjusted basis
after giving effect to the Transactions, as set forth in “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds” (including the borrowings under
the Senior Term Facilities, but excluding the drawing of an amount under the Revolving Credit Facility on or about the
Completion Date in respect of the working capital payment to Unilever), less pro forma cash and cash equivalents. We do
not currently have a figure for this payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is
subject to change prior to the Completion Date.
(10) Pro forma total net debt represents the aggregate principal amount of our debt as of December 31, 2017, on an as adjusted
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, as set forth in “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds” (including (i) the issuance
of the Notes offered hereby and the use of proceeds therefrom, (ii) borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and (iii) the
drawing of an amount under the Revolving Credit Facility on or about the Completion Date in respect of the working capital
payment to Unilever, but excluding shareholder loans), less pro forma cash and cash equivalents. We do not currently have
a figure for the working capital payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is subject
to change prior to the Completion Date. For purposes of our pro forma calculations we have assumed that the payment will
be €400 million.
(11) Pro forma total net debt (net of Acquisition-related short-term borrowings for working capital reimbursement) represents the
aggregate principal amount of our debt as of December 31, 2017, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, as set forth in “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds” (including (i) the issuance of the Notes offered hereby
and the use of proceeds therefrom and (ii) borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities, but excluding (x) the drawing of an
amount under the Revolving Credit Facility on or about the Completion Date in respect of the working capital payment to
Unilever and (y) shareholder loans), less pro forma cash and cash equivalents. We do not currently have a figure for the
working capital payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is subject to change prior
to the Completion Date.
(12) Pro forma interest expense is calculated using the interest expense of the financial indebtedness of FFG following the
Transactions as if the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2017. It includes (i) interest on the Notes offered hereby,
(ii) interest on borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities, (iii) ongoing commitment fees with respect to the Revolving
Credit Facility and (iv) the incremental interest expense associated with drawing of an amount under the Revolving Credit
Facility on or about the Completion Date to fund the working capital payment to Unilever. We do not currently have a figure
for this payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is subject to change prior to the
Completion Date. For purposes of our pro forma calculations we have assumed that the payment will be €400 million. Pro
_forma interest expense excludes (i) any interest expense with respect to other indebtedness of FFG which has been_
extinguished since January 1, 2017 or which is expected to be extinguished in connection with the Transactions and (ii) any
interest expense with respect to shareholder loans. Incremental interest expense on the drawing of the amount under the
Revolving Credit Facility to fund the working capital payment to Unilever, which will be subject to a variable interest rate, has
been calculated an interest rate of Euribor plus 3.00%, assuming the drawing is fully repaid within 90 days.
(13) Pro _forma_ interest expense (excluding interest on Acquisition-related short-term borrowings for working capital
reimbursement) is calculated using the interest expense of the financial indebtedness of FFG following the Transactions as if
the Transactions had occurred on January 1, 2017. It includes (i) interest on the Notes offered hereby, (ii) interest on
borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities and (iii) ongoing commitment fees with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility.
It excludes (i) any interest expense with respect to other indebtedness of FFG which has been extinguished since January 1,
2017 or which is expected to be extinguished in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any interest expense with respect to
shareholder loans and (iii) the incremental interest expense associated with drawing of an amount under the Revolving
Credit Facility on or about the Completion Date to fund the working capital payment to Unilever. We do not currently have a
figure for this payment but we estimate it to be in the range of €350 million to €450 million. This is subject to change prior to
the Completion Date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below_
_before deciding to invest in the Notes. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other_
_information in this Offering Memorandum, including the Financial Statements and accompanying notes_
_included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones_
_we or FFG face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or FFG or that we_
_or FFG currently consider immaterial could also impair FFG’s business, financial condition, results of_
_operations and our ability to make payments on the Notes._

_This_ _Offering_ _Memorandum_ _also_ _contains_ _forward-looking_ _statements_ _that_ _involve_ _risks_ _and_
_uncertainties. FFG’s actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever**

**_FFG has no history of operating as an independent company and is subject to a number of_**
**_risks in connection with its separation from Unilever._**

To date, FFG has been part of Unilever and is in the process of being separated into a stand-alone
business. FFG has no operating history as an independent company and certain essential business
functions are currently and will, pursuant to a number of TSAs, continue to be carried out centrally by
Unilever, including IT services, marketing, distribution, shared finance function, human resources,
workplace and travel services and logistics. The terms of the TSAs range from six to 18 months, with
early termination rights on a regional basis with advance written notice. The TSAs are an essential part
of the implementation of our strategy, allowing us to construct business infrastructure that is
appropriate to FFG’s needs as a stand-alone business without disrupting its operations during the
separation process. The services provided pursuant to the TSAs are bespoke and, in some cases,
interdependent, making the transition away from the TSAs to stand-alone operations particularly
complex. After the TSAs expire, we may not be able to replace these services at all, or to obtain these
services at prices or on terms as favorable as the TSAs provide. If the services covered by the TSAs
are not provided as anticipated or if we are unable to successfully implement plans to migrate from the
TSAs to stand-alone business functions, on the timescale anticipated and on the costs projected, or at
all, such developments could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and
results of operations. Any failure to recruit or retain sufficient staff when needed to deliver these standalone business functions could cause this risk to materialize. Any failure or significant disruption to the
delivery of Unilever’s services during the transitional period could impact the ability to produce and
deliver products, or prevent us from paying suppliers and employees, executing foreign currency
transactions or performing other administrative services on a timely basis, or could result in
weaknesses and deficiencies in its internal controls. Any such development could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_FFG’s historical results may not be representative of its future results as a separate,_**
**_stand-alone company._**

The Financial Statements presented in this Offering Memorandum are combined carve-out financial
statements prepared from the historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records of
Unilever. The Financial Statements may not necessarily reflect what its results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows would have been had FFG operated as a separate, stand-alone company or
reporting segment during the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum and, in particular, the
Financial Statements do not reflect the implementation of the separation blueprint or management’s
target operating model, which differs in substantial respects from the manner in which the business has
been operated under Unilever. Unilever did not account for FFG, and FFG did not operate, as a
separate, stand-alone company for the periods presented. The historical costs and expenses reflected
in FFG’s Financial Statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided
by Unilever, including legal, finance, human resources and other administrative functions. These
allocations are based on what FFG and Unilever consider to be reasonable reflections of the historical
utilization levels of these functions required in support of FFG’s business; however, we believe the
costs of these functions on a stand-alone basis will differ substantially from costs allocated historically.

34


-----

Moreover, the Financial Statements do not reflect the costs of borrowing funds as a separate entity.
The balance sheet information in the Financial Statements presented in this Offering Memorandum
was derived from Unilever’s centralized financial information. It includes items that are directly
attributable and/or separately identifiable to FFG’s business together with an allocation of relevant
balances from Unilever to FFG for those items that were not directly attributable or separately
identifiable. A number of estimates, judgements and assumptions were made for the purpose of
allocating those items that were not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable. See
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Financial Statements”. The balance sheet of the
standalone business once the separation from Unilever is complete will differ substantially from the
historic allocated balance sheet in many specific areas, including working capital, debt, equity,
intangible assets amongst others.

The Financial Statements and the other historical financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum do not necessarily indicate what FFG’s results of operations, financial condition, cash
flows or costs and expenses will be in the future. The adjustments made to arrive at the pro forma and
adjusted financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum reflect, among other things,
changes in FFG’s funding, operational model and overheads that are expected to result from its
separation from Unilever. However, there can be no assurance that these adjustments will reflect its
funding requirements and operating costs as a separate, stand-alone company. For more information
on results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, see “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information,” “Selected Historical Financial and Other Information,” “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Financial Statements and_
accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Our calculation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA is based on assumptions that may prove to be_**
**_inaccurate._**

Our calculation of pro forma Normalized EBITDA is based on several assumptions that may prove to
be inaccurate. We calculate pro forma Normalized EBITDA by adjusting FFG’s Normalized EBITDA to:

    - remove allocated supply chain and general overhead expenses that are associated with
services that we have historically received from Unilever, while adding back stand-alone costs
that we estimate would have been incurred by FFG by it providing such services internally or
by contracting with third parties, assuming FFG had already fully transitioned to a stand-alone
entity, which we estimate will require €200 million of transition-related expenses and one-time
expenditures, the substantial majority of which will be incurred by December 31, 2019;

    - reflect the full year run-rate effect of certain procurement savings, expected changes in
commodity prices and synergy initiatives recently undertaken by FFG in anticipation of its
separation;

    - reflect certain changes to FFG’s cost structure that are expected to result from the increased
use of third-party distributors after FFG’s separation from Unilever, including the transition of
32 markets from a direct distribution model to a third-party distributor model and the increased
use of third-party distributors in other markets; and

    - reflect certain branding and marketing cost savings that are expected to be implemented as
part of the separation from Unilever.

In anticipation of becoming a stand-alone entity, we have entered into negotiations with third-party
service providers. We have also engaged several consultants and industry experts to assist us in the
analysis of our anticipated cost structure. Our estimates are based on these expected contracts,
meetings and discussions, the advice of such industry experts and consultants, benchmarking against
other companies within our industry and the industry experience of our management team. The
expenses that we estimate we will incur through our internal operations and with third-party service
providers are based on several assumptions, including assumptions regarding the volumes of services
we will require from such third-party service providers, the price at which such services will be offered,
the number of employees we will require to operate as a stand-alone entity and the salaries and
benefits we will be required to pay such employees. We cannot assure you that these assumptions will
prove to be accurate. Given these uncertainties, we cannot assure you that the performance
improvements reflected in pro forma Normalized EBITDA will be reached.

Some of our estimates of volumes are based on volumes that are implied from Unilever’s historical
allocations of expenses to our business, which may not be accurate or fairly predict future costs and/or

35


-----

volumes. Where we anticipate entering into an agreement with a third-party service provider, but do not
yet have an executed contract, we based our assumptions on both the price at which we expect such
services will be provided, as well as the volumes of services that we expect we will require. We cannot
assure you that our assumptions regarding such expenses will prove to be accurate.

In calculating pro forma Normalized EBITDA, we also assumed that, after the expiration of the
transition period, we will no longer receive services from Unilever under the TSAs. Our ability to
transition from the services Unilever will provide to us during the transition period is subject to several
risks and uncertainties, including those described here, and we cannot assure you that we will not
require services from Unilever after the transition period.

**_Following the separation, we may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in our_**
**_purchasing power relative to the purchasing power possessed by FFG when it was owned by_**
**_Unilever._**

Historically, FFG has been able to take advantage of Unilever’s economies of scale and purchasing
power in purchasing edible oils and packaging materials, digital and traditional media, finished goods,
marketing and distribution services, technology and corporate services, including insurance, legal and
tax services, employee benefit support, finance and treasury functions, and audit services. Following
FFG’s separation from Unilever pursuant to the Transactions, we will be a smaller and less diversified
company than Unilever, and will not have access to financial and other resources comparable to those
of Unilever prior to the separation. In most markets, large media companies give large discounts based
on the amounts of media purchased. FFG, as part of Unilever, has benefitted from Unilever discounts
for both traditional and digital media. As a standalone entity FFG will try to negotiate favorable rates
and will consider entering media buying groups where possible, but there is no guarantee that FFG will
be successful. Even if FFG is successful, there will still likely be some increase in costs versus historic
rates.

As a separate, stand-alone company, we may be unable to obtain the foregoing goods and services at
prices and on terms as favorable as those available to FFG prior to the separation, which could have a
material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Following the separation, we may need to offer customers increased discounts, lose_**
**_distribution and potentially lose volumes resulting from a decrease in our selling power relative_**
**_to FFG’s selling power when it was owned by Unilever._**

As a smaller company with a narrower range of products, we may have a reduced ability to obtain
favorable pricing or trade terms from the retailers and distributors who purchase our products for
on-sale to end consumers. Some customers may take advantage of the fact that we are a smaller,
more narrowly focused business to induce us to offer them additional discounts or other investments.

Additionally, following the separation, we will not be able to rely on Unilever’s diversification, earnings,
assets, cash flow or credit, and will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining sufficient working
capital and servicing our own debt. There is a risk that market fluctuations and other events may
adversely impact us more significantly than if FFG were still part of Unilever.

**_Following the separation, we will experience a temporary increase in our working capital needs._**

Historically, FFG has maintained a net negative working capital position by managing its trade
payables on terms of up to 120 days, while managing its receivables on typically terms of 30 days or
less, in each case consistent with the markets for raw materials and finished products in which FFG
operates. In connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever
(i) receivables associated with sales of FFG’s products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) payables
associated with raw materials received by FFG prior to the Completion Date. We have therefore
agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing the average net negative working capital position of
FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and finished products conveyed with
the business on the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily our net
negative working capital position.

While the foregoing amounts cannot be known with precision as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum and are subject to change prior to the Completion Date, we estimate that the aggregate

36


-----

amount we will pay to Unilever on account of the the net value of FFG’s negative working capital
position will be in the range of €350 million to €450 million and that this amount will be paid on or about
the Completion Date. We expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility to make this payment.

While we expect our net working capital position to return to a net negative position and largely
normalize within 120 days after such payment is made (and we expect to repay the Revolving Credit
Facility drawing as our working capital position normalizes), there can be no guarantee that all of these
transaction will occur as and when expected and that our net working capital position will in fact
normalize on that schedule, or at all. Changes to trade terms available to us after the separation
(discussed further under the caption “—Changes to FFG’s payment terms with customers or suppliers
_may adversely affect is working capital position and operating cash flows”) as well as fluctuations in the_
underlying market prices or sales volumes for our products or the raw materials we consume, could
each delay or prevent the expected normalization of our net working capital position; moreover,
technical difficulties in valuing inventories and reconciling accounts may delay the date of the payment
in respect of the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position.

**_Changes to FFG’s payment terms with customers or suppliers may adversely affect its working_**
**_capital position and operating cash flows._**

After the separation from Unilever, FFG may experience significant pressure from suppliers to reduce
its payment terms. Many large FFG suppliers, especially raw and packaging material suppliers in the
developed world, have been able to utilize supplier financing arrangements while FFG was a part of
Unilever. As a standalone entity with a lower credit rating, it is unlikely that FFG will be able to offer
supplier financing on such attractive terms, and hence some suppliers may renew efforts to reduce
payment terms.

At the same time, FFG may experience pressure from its customers to extend the number of days
before paying its accounts receivable. Historically, FFG has benefitted from relatively short receivables
days as compared to its payable days, allowing it to operate with negative net working capital. Any
failure to continue to manage its accounts payable and accounts receivable in this manner, whether
due to changes in market practices, a reduction in scale brought about by the separation from Unilever,
the termination of any supplier finance arrangements historically sponsored by Unilever, or other
reasons, may negatively affect FFG’s working capital position and cash flows, which would have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The assets and employees that are being transferred to FFG from Unilever may not be sufficient_**
**_for us to operate as a stand-alone company, and we may experience difficulty in retaining_**
**_transferred employees, hiring new employees, acquiring additional assets or contracting_**
**_business services, and integrating these assets, services and employees into its business._**

Unilever has developed a separation blueprint which is intended to enable FFG’s business to continue
to run smoothly as it transitions to stand-alone operation. The implementation of the separation
blueprint is subject to execution risks and will require a significant amount of management’s time and
effort, diverting attention from the business and other strategic priorities.

Because FFG has not operated as a stand-alone company in the past, we may need to acquire assets,
obtain business services and hire employees in addition to those transferred by Unilever in connection
with the implementation of the separation blueprint. Moreover, as a smaller company with a different
ownership structure than Unilever, we may have difficulty retaining employees who are transferred
pursuant to the separation blueprint. We may face difficulty integrating newly acquired assets, newly
contracted services and newly hired employees into the business. In particular, FFG has a large
number of staffing vacancies relative to the positions that are expected to be required to be filled once
the TSAs terminate and the separation is fully completed. If we and FFG are unable to retain, recruit,
hire and train a sufficient number of qualified individuals to fill these vacancies, or if we or FFG are only
able to do so at higher than expected cost due to competition or any other reason, our ability to
successfully operate as a stand-alone business will be compromised.

Moreover, as a result of the separation from Unilever, we expect to shift from a direct sales model to a
third-party distributor model in 35 of FFG’s markets, while using Unilever’s distribution infrastructure
under a TSA during the interim. If we or FFG are unable to obtain satisfactory terms from such third
37


-----

party distributors, of if such third-party distributors do not perform to expectations, we may suffer a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the affected
markets.

**_We may not succeed Unilever under all joint ventures, contracts and licenses that historically_**
**_have formed part of FFG’s business._**

As part of the separation, Unilever agreed to assign its interest in a number of joint ventures, contracts
and licenses to FFG. In many cases, these assignments require the consent of the relevant
counterparty. Unilever and FFG are still in the process of seeking the consents of all relevant
counterparties. There can be no assurance that we or FFG will able to obtain these consents within a
reasonable period of time or at all. Moreover, even if consent is obtained and FFG succeeds to
Unilever under the relevant joint venture, contract or license, the relevant counterparty may terminate
the arrangement if it disagrees with the way we conduct business following the separation. If a
substantial number of these contracts, joint ventures and licenses were terminated, we may be forced
to enter into new contracts, joint ventures or licenses. Moreover, contracts to which FFG succeeds may
not be long-term in nature and may require renegotiation on a regular basis. Some of these new
counterparties may have stronger bargaining positions than when FFG’s existing contracts were
originally negotiated. As a result, we may not be able to secure replacement contracts, or may only be
able to secure replacement contracts on less favorable terms. Any of these events could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG may lose rights to key intellectual property arrangements as a result of no longer being_**
**_part of Unilever._**

As part of Unilever, FFG benefited from the use of some of Unilever’s intellectual property rights,
including cross-licensing arrangements and licenses from third parties, in order to operate its business.
While the TSAs are intended to provide transitional coverage, and while Unilever has agreed to
transfer or license to us certain intellectual property that is within its power to transfer or license which
has been used in the conduct of FFG’s business, following the separation we may no longer be a
beneficiary under a number of Unilever’s existing agreements with third-parties. As a result, we may
not have rights to use important intellectual property that FFG has previously been licensed to use and
may therefore be subject to claims that FFG is infringing intellectual property rights of third parties
through the manufacture and sale of its products and the operation of its business.

FFG has negotiated its own patent cross-license agreements and arrangements with a number of the
industry participants with which Unilever has patent cross-license agreements. However, FFG has not
completed negotiations with respect to all such agreements and arrangements and cannot assure you
that it will be able to do so successfully.

**_As FFG builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own_**
**_systems, it may incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business_**
**_interruptions._**

FFG relies on its information technology (“IT”) systems for communication among its suppliers,
manufacturing plants, distribution functions, headquarters and customers. Its performance depends on
the availability of accurate and timely data and other information from key software applications to aid
day-to-day business and decision-making processes. FFG may be adversely affected if the controls
designed to manage information technology operational risks fail to contain such risks.

Prior to FFG’s separation from Unilever, FFG was fully integrated into Unilever’s IT environment. As
part of the separation, FFG is migrating its data and business processes to its own stand-alone IT
infrastructure, including critical business functions such as accounting and reporting, manufacturing
process control, quality and compliance systems, customer service, inventory control and distribution.
We expect that the IT migration process will take a substantial amount of time before and after the
consummation of the Acquisition and require the incurrence of substantial one-time costs, which are
currently estimated at approximately €165 million, including certain manufacturing and IT costs. There
can be no assurance that this figure will not grow as the IT transition progresses.

During a transitional period after the consummation of the Acquisition, we will have access to
Unilever’s IT environment under a TSA. If this is not properly managed, we may incur temporary

38


-----

interruptions in business operations. However the biggest risk will occur when we transition from
Unilever’s existing transactional and operational systems, data centers and shared services teams to
independent systems, data centers and shared services. We may not be successful in implementing
these new systems, they may cost more to run than expected and we may incur substantially higher
costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Any unexpected operational interruptions as the
new systems are implemented, or a failure to implement the new systems and replace Unilever’s
services successfully, could disrupt the business and have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to replicate or transition certain
systems, our ability to comply with legal, accounting and regulatory requirements could be impaired.

**_FFG may not be successful in establishing a strong corporate identity._**

Historically, FFG’s consumer products have traded in their individual markets under local brand names
(such as “Flora,” “Country Crock” and “Blue Band”) which will convey with the business, these brands
have also been closely linked to the Unilever corporate identity, and all of FFG’s consumer products
display additional Unilever corporate branding on their packages. Once FFG becomes an independent
company, such products must cease using “Unilever” as a corporate identity or trade name on
packaging within 12 months. It is unknown what impact this will have on consumer preference.

In addition, Unilever’s corporate identity is widely recognized and respected by customers, suppliers,
business partners and potential employees. We will need to expend significant time, effort and
resources to establish a new corporate identity in the marketplace. We cannot guarantee that this effort
will ultimately be successful. If our efforts to establish a strong corporate identity are unsuccessful, our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

**_We have made certain assumptions relating to the Acquisition in forecasts that may prove to be_**
**_materially inaccurate._**

We have made certain assumptions relating to the forecast level of cost savings, synergies and
associated costs of the Acquisition. These assumptions are based on information available to us and
FFG, which we believe to be reasonable. However, these assumptions and forecasts may prove to be
inaccurate, and we may suffer from any of: a failure to realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition,
higher than expected transaction and integration costs, costs related to unknown liabilities, and a
deterioration of our business due to general economic and business conditions. Specifically, the
Issuer’s objective to realize approximately €200 million in annual run-rate cost savings described under
“Summary—Strategy” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum may differ materially from our
actual results and investors should not place undue reliance on this objective. We have not defined,
and do not intend to define, “short term” or “medium term”, and these should not be read as indicating
that we are targeting such cost savings for any particular fiscal year. This cost savings objective is
based on a number of assumptions which are inherently subject to significant business, operational,
economic and other risks, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, such assumptions
may change or may not materialize at all. In addition, unanticipated events may adversely affect our
actual results in future periods whether or not these assumptions otherwise prove to be correct. As a
result, our actual cost savings, if any, may vary materially from this objective. Any of the foregoing may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations following the consummation
of the Acquisition and could cause our actual results to differ from the assumptions and forecasts set
forth in this Offering Memorandum.

**_The benefits of the separation may not materialize and we may not be successful in_**
**_implementing our growth strategy._**

Due to a combination of market conditions and internal challenges, FFG’s sales have been declining
for the past few years. Our future success depends in large part on our ability to halt this decline and
implement FFG’s growth strategy, including revitalizing FFG’s core product range, increasing
penetration across price segments in the B&M market, continuing to move into growing adjacent
product categories including DCA products and plant-based dips, accelerating growth in emerging
markets, increasing distribution of products in the foodservice channel and private-label segments and
creating further cost efficiencies in its production and supply chain.

Our ability to successfully execute this growth strategy to completion depends in large part on our
ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the separation from Unilever, including the

39


-----

implementation of a de-layered and simplified operating model, dedicated and focused sales
organization, reductions in branding, marketing and overhead expenses, cost savings and efficiencies
associated with a more tailored procurement structure, relaxed nutritional parameters allowing
renewed focus on taste, functionality and supply chain efficiency, and a dedicated IT landscape.

There are significant risks associated with the implementation of the separation blueprint and there can
be no assurance that we will be able to achieve anticipated efficiencies following the separation from
Unilever. In particular, we may encounter challenges to business continuity while central functions are
separated, manufacturing sites are being separated, loss of volumes during the change in distribution
infrastructure in certain markets, and delays or overruns in the implementation of the IT landscape.

In many respects, we will be dependent on Unilever to manage these risks and operate the FFG
business on a transitional basis pursuant to the TSAs. However, there can be no assurance that the
services provided under the TSAs will meet our requirements in a timely and effective manner. It is
also possible that we may need to operate under the TSAs for longer than expected if it is not able to
implement current plans to build the relevant stand-alone business functions in a timely manner, as it
may be difficult for us to replace, or undertake on its own, the services provided under the TSAs, at
reasonable costs or at all.

A failure to implement FFG’s cost optimization and growth strategies, in whole or in part, including due
to its inability to realize the anticipated benefits from its separation from Unilever and to successfully
transition from its dependence on the TSAs with Unilever, may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We will not control FFG until the consummation of the Acquisition._**

We do not currently own FFG and we will not acquire FFG until the consummation of the Acquisition,
which is expected to take place in the third quarter of 2018, subject to antitrust clearances. We cannot
assure you that during the interim period the business of FFG will be operated in the same way that we
would operate it. Any of the risks associated with our lack of control over FFG until the consummation
of the Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of
operations.

In addition, prior to the Completion Date, FFG will not be subject to the covenants described in
“Description of the Notes.” As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to such date, FFG will not take an
action that would otherwise have been prohibited had such covenants been applicable to it.

**_We have relied on representations and warranties that Unilever has provided to us under the_**
**_Acquisition Agreement._**

In connection with the Acquisition, Unilever has given certain customary representations and
warranties under the Acquisition Agreement related to FFG’s business, as well as certain indemnities
in respect of historic claims. We have relied on these representations and warranties about FFG’s
business in connection with the Transactions. If these representations and warranties are not true and
correct in all material respects, we may suffer losses or be unable to perform to expectations.
Moreover, if we suffer losses in respect of historic claims, we may rely on Unilever to pay us
appropriate compensation under its indemnities. In either such an event, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to recover on damages or indemnity claims from Unilever relating to any such
breaches or losses in an amount sufficient to fully compensate us for our losses or underperformance.

**_Amendments made to the Acquisition Agreement may have adverse consequences for holders_**
**_of the Notes._**

The Acquisition is expected to be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition
Agreement. However, the Acquisition Agreement may be amended and the closing conditions may be
waived at any time by the parties thereto. Any amendment made to the Acquisition Agreement, or
waiver of the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition, may be adverse to the interests of the holders
of the Notes, which, in turn, may have an adverse effect on the investment return you expect to receive
on the Notes.

40


-----

**_We will incur significant transaction and separation costs as a result of the Acquisition._**

We expect to incur significant one-time transaction costs related to the Acquisition. These transaction
costs include investment banking, legal and accounting fees and expenses and other related charges.
We may also incur additional unanticipated transaction costs in connection with the Acquisition.

We also expect to incur significant one-time costs related to FFG’s separation from Unilever. These
separation-related costs are presently estimated at approximately €200 million (the substantial majority
of which is expected to be incurred by December 31, 2019) and include costs related to separating
FFG’s IT, real estate and other corporate functions from shared services provided by Unilever.
Moreover, we expect to incur additional one-time costs to implement our plans for the business after
the Acquisition is consummated. These include the incurrence of approximately €45 million to
€50 million of non-recurring restructuring and related costs (the majority of which are expected to be
incurred by December 31, 2020) in connection with the Issuer’s plans to realize approximately
€200 million in annual run-rate cost savings in the business, and an estimated €175 million of one-time
branding and marketing expenditures which FFG expects to make to re-position itself and its brands
after completion of the Acquisition, which are expected to be incurred over the short to medium term.

The costs associated with the foregoing items may turn out to be higher than the estimates set forth in
this Offering Memorandum. Any material increase in these costs could adversely affect our financial
position or results of operations.

**Risks related to the Offering**

**_Until the Consummation of the Acquisition, we will have limited assets._**

Holders of the Notes will not have any recourse to FFG or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition. Until the completion of the Acquisition, the Notes will be the
obligation solely of the Issuer and will be guaranteed solely by Midco, U.S. Midco, Bidco and Sigma US
Corp. (on an unsecured basis). Apart from its interest in the Deposit Accounts, the Issuer will have
limited assets until such time and, as a result, the sole recourse of the holders of the Notes prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition will effectively be the funds deposited in the Deposit Accounts.

**_The proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be placed in deposit accounts and if the Deposit_**
**_Accounts release conditions are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes,_**
**_which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes. No third party escrow_**
**_agent shall control the Deposit Accounts._**

Prior to the satisfaction of the Deposit Accounts release conditions, the gross proceeds of the offering
of the Notes will be held in the applicable Deposit Accounts, which shall be segregated and controlled
by the Issuer. If the Deposit Accounts release conditions, as described in “Description of the Notes—
_Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” are not satisfied by or prior to the Longstop_
Date, or in the event of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption and you may not obtain the return you expect to receive on such Notes. The Indenture will
require the Issuer to consummate the Acquisition promptly upon release of the proceeds from the
Deposit Accounts. The gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be limited and will not be
sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption price, which is equal to 100% of the initial issue
price of the applicable series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the date
of the special mandatory redemption and additional amounts, if any. To the extent not available in the
Deposit Accounts, KKR European Fund IV L.P. and KKR Americas Fund XII L.P. (the “Funds”) will be
required to fund any accrued and unpaid interest (including any negative interest payable on any of the
Deposit Accounts) and additional amounts owing to holders of the Notes pursuant to an equity
commitment of the Funds. However, there can be no assurance that the Funds will have sufficient
funds to make these payments, and the Issuer may not have access to the funds necessary to allow it
to pay the full amount of the required redemption price in the event of a special mandatory redemption.

Furthermore, the Deposit Proceeds will be deposited in segregated accounts that are controlled by the
Issuer. There will be no independent third party such as an escrow agent controlling the use and
release of the Deposit Proceeds, and therefore, despite certain requirements around how and when
the funds may be used and released, there can be no guarantee that the same protections of the funds
that are expected in a customary escrow arrangement will be realized here. See “Description of the
_Notes—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_

41


-----

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in business or financial
condition or the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (other than a change that would be materially
prejudicial to the interests of the holders of the Notes, which will require the consent of holders of a
majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes) or the financing thereof, between the closing
of this offering and the release of the proceeds from the Deposit Accounts, will have no effect on your
rights as a purchaser of the Notes.

**_The Issuer will be a holding company and is therefore financially dependent on receiving_**
**_distributions from its Subsidiaries._**

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will be a holding company and all of its operations
will be conducted through its subsidiaries. Consequently, it relies on repayments of intercompany
loans, dividends or advances from its subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are not wholly owned.
The ability of these subsidiaries to repay intercompany loans or pay dividends, and the Issuer’s ability
to receive distributions from its investments in other entities are subject to applicable laws and other
restrictions. In addition, such repayments, dividends and distributions may be subject to withholding
and other taxes which may lead to double taxation or other costs to the Issuer. These laws,
restrictions, taxes and costs could limit the repayment of intercompany loans and the payment of
dividends and distributions, which could restrict the Issuer’s ability to fund operations, and could have a
material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.

**Risks Related to FFG’s Business and Industry**

**_FFG operates in a highly competitive market and its failure to compete effectively could_**
**_adversely affect its results of operations._**

The markets for B&M products are highly competitive globally, particularly in developed markets, which
accounts for the majority of FFG’s turnover. In developed markets, the margarine sector in particular
has experienced a secular decline in recent years, which has heightened competitive pressures. FFG’s
competitors include retailers who promote private label products and well-established branded
producers that operate on both a national and an international basis across single or multiple dairy and
non-dairy categories. FFG’s competitors generally compete with it on the basis of price, actual or
perceived quality, health benefits and “naturalness” of products, brand recognition, consumer loyalty,
product variety, new product development and improvements to existing products. FFG might not
successfully compete with existing or new competitors in the markets in which it operates. In addition,
FFG intends to launch a variety of new products and expand into new price points and market
segments, and may not successfully compete with existing or new competitors in such markets. For
instance, FFG expects to introduce new products across the price spectrum, including expanding its
premium line of products. However, an increase in the market share of discounters, which are
supermarket retailers which offer a narrow range of grocery products at discounted prices and which
typically focus on non-branded products, may adversely affect sales of such premium products. FFG
also intends to accelerate and expand its private label, DCA and foodservice offerings. However,
margins in these markets tend to be lower than in branded and premium retail offerings, and there is
no guarantee that FFG will be competitive in the private label, DCA or foodservice markets or achieve
its expected return on investment from these strategies.

In addition, FFG cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors or their effect on
consumer perceptions or the success of its own advertising and promotional efforts. FFG’s competitors
have developed and launched products targeted to compete directly with its products. FFG’s retail
customers generally control the shelf space allocations within their stores and may allocate more shelf
space to generic or private label products or to FFG’s branded competitors’ products in accordance
with their respective promotional strategies. Decreases in shelf space allocated to FFG’s products,
increases in competitor promotional activity, aggressive marketing strategies by competitors or other
factors may require FFG to reduce its prices or invest greater amounts in advertising and promotion of
its products to ensure its products remain competitive.

Furthermore, some of FFG’s competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other
resources than those of FFG in certain markets. This creates competitive pressures that could cause
FFG to lose market share or require FFG to lower prices, increase advertising expenditures or increase
the use of discounting or promotional campaigns. These competitive factors may also restrict FFG’s

42


-----

ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Any inability to
continue to respond effectively to these and other competitive pressures could negatively impact FFG’s
sales volumes and margins, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Established negative trends in the B&M market and changes in consumer preferences may_**
**_have a material adverse effect on FFG’s turnover, results of operations and financial condition._**

The B&M industry has experienced sustained negative trends and is subject to changing consumer
trends, demands and preferences. Retail B&M sales volumes have declined consistently in recent
years and are expected to continue declining, driven by reduced occasions for using spreads
(principally due to reductions in the consumption of bread) and shifts towards the consumption of food
prepared outside the home, which drives B&M sales volumes into the industrial and foodservice
channels where FFG is less well established and where margins are significantly lower.

Retailers have tended to reduce the space allocated to B&M on shelves, but at a slower rate than the
market decline. However, in the future, retailers may choose to increase the pace of shelf-space
reduction in order to free up valuable space for other fast-growing categories. A change in the rate of
shelf-space reduction could drive further declines in the overall B&M market. FFG is be particularly
exposed to shelf-space reduction as it has numerous brands in most markets. Any worsening of this
trend in the B&M market could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Trends within the B&M industry change often and FFG’s failure to anticipate, identify or react to
changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced demand and price reductions, and
could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Factors that may affect consumer tastes and preferences include:

    - dietary trends and attention to different nutritional aspects of foods,

    - concerns regarding the health effects and sourcing practices relating to specific ingredients
and nutrients,

    - trends regarding the taste profile of spreads,

    - a shift in preference from non-organic to organic, from GMO to non-GMO, and from
non-natural products to natural products,

    - the availability of competing private label products offered by retailers,

    - trends toward eating and baking outside of the home,

    - concerns regarding the public health consequences associated with obesity, and

    - increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production (in
particular those related to palm oil, which is a key ingredient in the production of FFG’s PlantBased Spreads).

There has been considerable amount of negative press coverage in recent years of products made
from palm oil, due to both health and environmental concerns. This negative press has affected FFG
products in several European markets, in particular Spain, France and Italy. There is a risk that this
press coverage and the resulting negative consumer perception of products made from palm oil may
escalate and spread to other markets in Europe and the rest of the world. While FFG has some
palm-oil free products in certain markets, the vast majority our products contain palm-oil and switching
to exclusively palm-oil free or even predominantly palm-oil free products is not currently technically
feasible or cost effective.

FFG’s success will be impacted by its ability to anticipate and identify consumer trends and
preferences, and to offer products that appeal to consumer needs and preferences on a timely and
affordable basis. In doing so, FFG may also be required to leverage its research and development
capabilities, and to utilize management’s ability to launch new or improved products quickly,
successfully and on a cost-effective basis. A decrease in demand for FFG’s products due to a shift in
consumer tastes or preferences to which FFG is unable to respond in a timely and cost-effective
manner may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_In a declining B&M market, butter’s relative share of the overall market has grown in recent_**
**_years, at the expense of the Plant-Based Spreads that FFG produces._**

In recent years, the dairy industry has successfully convinced many consumers that butter products
are more “natural” and hence healthier than plant-based spreads. This perception of naturalness
combined with strong taste profiles have enabled dairy manufacturers to increase their market share
relative to FFG and other manufacturers of Plant-Based Spreads.

In 2017, FFG benefitted from record high butter pricing in Europe and this contributed in part to FFG’s
improved turnover trends in the second half of 2017. Butter prices have now pulled back from these
highs in certain markets and may continue to fall. Renewed competition from cheaper butter could
have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG’s ability to invest in the image of its brands to prevent erosion of the reputation or appeal_**
**_of one or more of its leading brands could negatively impact FFG’s sales and results of_**
**_operations._**

Nearly all of FFG’s turnover derives from sales of its branded products, and the success of its business
has resulted from the strength of its brands. FFG’s financial success is directly dependent on
consumer and customer perception of its brands, including Becel, Rama, Flora, ProActiv, Country
Crock, I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!, and Blue Band. The success of FFG’s brands may suffer if its
marketing plans, marketing spend levels or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a
brand’s image or its ability to attract consumers or if consumer or customer perceptions of FFG’s
brands or products change unfavorably. In particular, FFG’s investments in marketing activities for new
brands and projects may divert resources from its existing brands, and there can be no assurance that
such investments will be successful or that consumer or customer perceptions of its existing brands will
not suffer as a result. FFG’s results of operations could be negatively affected if the reputation of one
or more of its brands suffers damage due to real or perceived quality issues with its products, or if it is
found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations. Any circumstances which publicly damage
FFG’s customer goodwill, injures its reputation or damages its business relationships may lead to a
broader adverse effect on FFG’s business and prospects by way of loss of business, goodwill,
customers, joint venture partners and employees beyond the monetary liability arising directly from the
damaging events.

**_FFG’s future results and competitive position are dependent on the successful development of_**
**_new products and improvement of existing products, which is subject to a number of_**
**_difficulties and uncertainties._**

FFG’s future results and ability to maintain or improve its competitive position depend on its ability to
identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products successfully. A key element
of FFG’s growth strategy is to introduce new products and re-launch and extend existing product lines
in each of the markets in which it operates to counteract decreases in sales of existing products, as
well as to increase overall sales of its products. For instance, FFG intends to launch a variety of new
products and formats across the price spectrum, including a premium line of Plant-Based Spreads
products to enhance its spreadable butter and mélange offering, and to expand its offering in adjacent
categories, including sweet spreads and non-dairy milk and plant-based dips. The launch and success
of new or modified products are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance as to FFG’s
continuing ability to develop and launch successful new products or variations of existing products.
While mélanges, non-dairy milk and plant-based dips are all growing segments, other producers have
developed leading positions in those markets which FFG may find difficult to challenge. There is also
no guarantee that existing FFG brands can stretch into these new segments. The success of FFG’s
product development is affected by its ability to anticipate changing consumer trends and preferences,
to leverage its research and development capabilities, and to utilize management’s ability to launch
new or improved products quickly, successfully and on a cost-effective basis. If FFG is unsuccessful in
developing new products in an efficient and economical manner, demand for its products may
decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

44


-----

**_If FFG does not manage its supply chain effectively, its operating results may be adversely_**
**_affected._**

The inability of FFG’s manufacturing facilities, as well as any supplier of raw materials, third-party
distributor or warehouse, to deliver or perform in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause FFG’s
operating costs to increase and its profit margins to decrease. FFG will also be dependent on
co-packing arrangements with Unilever in certain jurisdictions for a period of time following separation.

FFG is dependent on third-party suppliers of raw materials and packaging for its products. FFG’s
suppliers may fail to meet timelines or contractual obligations or provide sufficient products, which may
adversely affect its business. Certain of FFG’s contracts with key suppliers, such as for the raw
materials it uses in its products, are short term and can be terminated by the supplier upon giving
advanced written notice. Failure to appropriately structure or adequately manage FFG’s agreements
with third parties may adversely affect its supply of products.

FFG is also dependent on third parties for most of its warehousing and substantially all of its
transportation requirements. Certain factors affecting distribution costs, including oil prices, are either
subject to market fluctuations or controlled by FFG’s third-party carriers. Temporary or long-term
disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts or other events
could impair FFG’s ability to supply products affordably or in a timely manner. If FFG is unable to
produce and effectively distribute sufficient quantities in response to demand for its products,
consumers may look to purchase alternative or competitive products. Moreover, if FFG is unable to
manage its supply chain efficiently, its operating costs could increase, adversely affecting its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG is subject to the risks associated with operating and maintaining its manufacturing_**
**_facilities, as well as relying on third-party manufacturing facilities._**

Once the separation process from Unilever is complete, FFG will own and operate a total of
17 production facilities, comprising ten factories in developed markets and seven factories in emerging
markets. These facilities produced approximately 88% of FFG’s total production volume in 2016. FFG
is therefore subject to the risks associated with operating, and must incur potentially significant capital
and other expenditures necessary to maintain, its manufacturing facilities, machinery and equipment.
FFG must maintain its manufacturing facilities in order to, among other things, keep up with demand
for its products, retain sufficient capacity to manufacture new products and increase its margins. If FFG
is unable to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity to keep up with demand for its products and
ensure that its sales and production teams adequately coordinate their planning and production efforts,
FFG risks losing potential product sales.

Of the 17 total production facilities, seven will transfer in their entirety to FFG as part of the separation
process, and there will be a process of physically splitting the other ten sites where FFG and Unilever
production lines exist side-by-side. Certain existing spreads-related production equipment will be
relocated from sites that will remain with Unilever to sites that will belong to FFG, in order to create a
stand-alone operating profile. FFG has also entered into certain co-packing agreements with Unilever
on a transitional basis in locations where certain manufacturing capacity cannot be fully separated. If
these arrangements are not implemented as expected or if, once implemented, they have an
unexpected impact on FFG’s manufacturing capability, its results of operations could be adversely
impacted.

Furthermore, FFG has relationships with numerous third-party manufacturing facilities, which produced
approximately 9% of FFG’s total production volume in 2016. FFG currently relies on and may continue
to rely on third-party manufacturers to produce its products in certain smaller volume or emerging
markets which it would not be able to service otherwise. FFG’s third-party manufacturers are required
to maintain the quality of its products and to comply with its product specifications and requirements for
certain certifications; however, FFG has less control over third-party manufacturing facilities when
compared to directly owned facilities. The failure of any third-party manufacturer to produce products
that conform to FFG’s standards could materially and adversely affect FFG’s reputation in the
marketplace and result in product recalls, product liability claims and economic loss. FFG also faces
risks of losing control of its intellectual property when third-party manufacturers require access to its

Any loss of the use of all or a portion of FFG’s own or contracted third-party facilities due to accidents,
fires, explosions, labor issues, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters such as floods,
tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms and earthquakes, supply interruptions, transportation interruptions,
human error, mechanical failure, terrorist acts, power outages, discharges or releases of hazardous
substances and other environmental issues, or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a
material adverse effect on FFG and its operations. For example, the consolidated New Century
manufacturing plant in Kansas, U.S.A., produces the substantial majority of all FFG products sold in
the United States. Another example is DCA production, where the vast majority of FFG’s global
volumes are produced at the Kleve factory in Germany. Any loss of the use of all or a portion of any of
such key facilities could result in substantial business losses, production delays, third-party lawsuits
and significant repair costs, as well as personal injury and/or loss of life, which could materially and
adversely affect FFG’s business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows.

Moreover, unexpected failures of FFG’s equipment and machinery could result in production delays,
turnover loss and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to its employees. In some cases, facilities
are designated for certain types of products based on the unique equipment involved and it is more
difficult, or impossible, for FFG to shift production of these products among its facilities. Any
interruption in production capability may require FFG to make large capital expenditures to remedy the
situation and could require significant lead time replacing, which could have a negative impact on its
profitability and cash flows. A loss or interruption in production at certain of FFG’s facilities could
disrupt its operations and affect a large number of customers, decreasing its turnover. The operation of
manufacturing facilities also requires FFG to hire, train and evaluate large numbers of production
employees, which involves additional labor and employment related risks and uncertainties.

FFG and its third-party manufacturers are also subject to losses associated with equipment shutdowns,
which may be caused by the loss or interruption of electrical power to manufacturing facilities due to
unusually high demand, blackouts, adverse weather, equipment failure or other catastrophic events.
Losses caused by disruptions in the supply of electrical power could materially and adversely affect
FFG’s business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and cash flows.

**_Significant disruption in FFG’s workforce, increasing labor costs or work stoppages by_**
**_unionized employees could adversely affect FFG’s business, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

FFG has in the past, and may in the future, experience labor disputes and work stoppages at one or
more of its manufacturing sites due to localized strikes or strikes in the larger retail food industry
sector. FFG has also been involved in negotiations on collective bargaining agreements. A labor
stoppage or other interruption at one of FFG’s manufacturing sites could impact its ability to supply
customers and could have a pronounced effect on its operations. Future labor disturbances or work
stoppages at any of FFG’s or its suppliers’ facilities, or an inability to negotiate or renew collective
bargaining agreements from time to time on suitable terms or at all, may have an adverse effect on
such facility’s operations and, potentially, on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

An increase in labor and employee benefit costs could adversely affect FFG’s profitability. Most of the
factors affecting labor costs are beyond FFG’s control and FFG may not be able to adjust its pricing to
reflect an increase in labor costs. A shortage of qualified employees, general inflationary pressure on
wages or an increase in national minimum wages or industry or union agreed wages in any of the
jurisdictions in which FFG operates could increase its labor costs and have a material adverse effect
on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG depends on information technology systems to operate its business. Any failure, data_**
**_security breach or technological changes could have a significant negative impact on its_**
**_business._**

FFG’s business activities rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its
various computer and communication systems, including information technology platforms. Any
inadequate system design or any failure of current Unilever-provided or future stand-alone systems
could impair its ability to receive, process and reconcile transactions, manage supply chain and
manufacturing functions, manage compliance and risk functions, and conduct other day-to-day
operations of the business. In addition, FFG’s computer and communications systems are vulnerable

46


-----

to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including attacks by computer malware, electronic
break-ins or cyber-attacks, theft or corruption of confidential data or other unanticipated problems. We
cannot assure you that any preventive measures that FFG has taken offer the appropriate level of
security or protection. The cost of implementation for emerging and future technologies could also be
significant.

In connection with the separation from Unilever, FFG will transition its information technology
landscape from one embedded within Unilever’s systems to a new, stand-alone platform. The transition
process is expected to involve material costs and expenditures and could involve or result in delays,
malfunctions or other issues as more fully set forth under the caption “—Risks Related to FFG’s
_Separation From Unilever—As FFG builds its information technology infrastructure and transitions its_
_data to its own systems, it may incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business_
_interruptions.”_

Any significant disruption of FFG’s computer or communication systems could affect its ability to
manage its information technology systems or lead to recovery costs, litigation brought by customers
or business partners, reputational damage or a diminished ability to operate the business, which in turn
could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Fluctuations and volatility in FFG’s raw material costs as well as increases in other inbound_**
**_supply chain costs could materially adversely affect FFG’s operating results._**

The primary raw materials used in the production of FFG’s products are commodities, primarily
comprising liquid vegetable oils (such as rapeseed, soybean, and sunflower oil) and tropical oils, such
as palm oil. In some markets, FFG buys blended oils. Additional primary inputs include cardboard and
plastic packaging materials and utility inputs such as water and energy. FFG obtains substantially all of
its raw materials and packaging supplies from third-party suppliers, with raw material and packaging
expenditures representing 45% and 15%, respectively, of FFG’s total supply chain costs (35% and
12%, respectively, of FFG’s total costs), in each case in the year ended December 31, 2017. The
availability and cost of raw materials and packaging used in FFG’s products are variable and can be
significantly affected by a number of factors beyond its control, such as general economic conditions,
agricultural policies, government programs, weather conditions such as frosts, drought and floods, and
plant diseases, pests and other acts of nature. For example, in 2016 peanut availability was reduced to
in part to aflatoxins in Argentinian peanut crops. Because FFG does not control the production of raw
materials or packaging materials, it is also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production of
such materials based on conditions not within its control. Such conditions include industrial actions or
strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation interruptions, natural
disasters, palm oil sustainability issues and boycotts of products or other catastrophic events. As a
result, FFG is not assured of continued supply, pricing, or exclusive access to raw materials or
packaging materials from any of its suppliers.

There can be no assurance that FFG or its manufacturers will be able to obtain alternative sources of
raw materials or packaging materials at reasonable prices, or at all, should there be shortages or other
unfavorable conditions. FFG enters into forward purchase commitments and other financial hedging
transactions to secure the costs of projected commodity inputs needed to produce its products and
insulate the business from short-term volatility. These commitments are stated at a firm price, or as a
discount or premium from a future commodity price. However, there can be no assurance that such
hedging transactions will successfully reduce FFG’s exposure to price volatility in the long term. In
addition, not all of the commodities that FFG needs for its products can be hedged. As it expands its
business into new product categories, FFG may not be able to hedge the prices of all of the
commodities which it needs for its business at reasonable prices or at all.

FFG’s manufacturing facilities also require additional supply chain inputs to process and produce
products, such as labor, electricity, general overhead and transportation. In particular, the price of
electricity and other energy resources required in the manufacture, storage and distribution of FFG’s
products may be subject to volatile market conditions. A sustained increase in these inbound supply
chain costs can also affect the cost of manufacturing products. These costs may also fluctuate
significantly over time due to factors that are beyond FFG’s control, which could have an adverse effect
on FFG’s business.

47


-----

FFG’s inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for its products or other supply chain inputs
at reasonable prices, or at all, as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise, could cause an
increase in FFG’s cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in its margin, or cause its sales and
earnings to fluctuate from period to period. Such fluctuations may result in a decrease in gross margin
and could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, results of operations and financial
conditions.

**_FFG’s inability to pass on price increases for materials or other inputs to its customers could_**
**_adversely affect its margins in developed markets._**

FFG’s ability to pass through increases in the prices of commodities and packaging materials to its
customers depends, among others, on prevailing competitive conditions and pricing methods in the
markets in which it operates, and it may not be able to pass through such price increases to its
customers. Even if FFG is able to pass through increases in prices, there is typically a time lag
between cost increases affecting its business and the implementation of product price increases, which
are ultimately within the discretion of the retailer, during which time FFG’s margin may be reduced.
A time lag in the recovery of cost inflation, driven by either commodity cost increases or changes in the
foreign exchange rate of the currency the commodity is denominated in, can also negatively impact
FFG’s margins. In addition, during negotiations to increase prices to recover commodity cost
increases, retailers may take actions which exacerbate the impact of such cost increases. FFG’s
inability to pass through price increases in commodities and packaging materials and preserve its profit
margins in the future could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG relies substantially on sales to large food retailers and in the event they give higher_**
**_priority to private label or other branded products, or if the concentration and buying power of_**
**_these large retailers increase, FFG’s business could be adversely affected._**

FFG’s customers include supermarkets and large chain food retailers in the United Kingdom,
Germany, the United States, most other developed markets and some emerging markets. Throughout
FFG’s markets, and particularly in Developed Markets (where FFG derived 79% of its turnover in the
year ended December 31, 2017), the food retail segments are highly concentrated. In the year ended
December 31, 2017, FFG’s top five customers in each of its top ten markets accounted for between
approximately 40% to 90% of turnover in each such market. In recent years, the major retailers in
many of FFG’s key markets have increased their share of the grocery market through consolidation
and formation of buying groups, and price competition between retailers has intensified. This price
competition has led the major retailers to seek lower prices from their suppliers, including FFG, and to
reject price increases. The strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position gives them significant
leverage over their suppliers in negotiating pricing, product specification and the level of supplier
participation in promotional campaigns and offers, which can reduce FFG’s margins. Further
consolidation among the major retailers or disproportionate customer growth in relation to their
competitors could increase their relative negotiating power and allow them to force a negative shift in
FFG’s trade terms. FFG’s results of operations could also be adversely affected if it is required to
reduce its prices or increase its promotional spending activity as a consequence of an increase in the
strength of the major retailers’ bargaining position, if it loses business from a major retail customer or if
its relationship with a major customer deteriorates.

Food retailers, including mainstream grocery chains which carry FFG products as well as discount
chains (such as Aldi and Lidl) which tend not to carry major brands, also offer generic or private label
products that compete directly with FFG’s products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases.
Accordingly, there is a risk that FFG’s customers may give higher priority to private label products or
the branded products of its competitors, which would adversely affect sales of FFG’s products.
Moreover, given the growth in market share of discount grocery chains, there is a risk that consumers
could increasingly shop at discount chains offering only private label products, which would adversely
affect sales of FFG’s products and put increasing pressure on FFG’s mainstream grocery chain
customers. In the event FFG tenders to supply private label products to certain retailers, it may win
back some volume but at the expense of lower turnover and margins. FFG may be unable to
adequately respond to these trends and, as a result, the volume of its sales may decrease or it may
need to lower the prices of its products, either of which could adversely affect its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_FFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its customers and suppliers._**

FFG’s business is subject to the risks of non-payment and non-performance by its customers. FFG
manages its exposure to credit risk through credit analysis and monitoring procedures, and sometimes
uses letters of credit, prepayments and guarantees. However, these procedures and policies cannot
fully eliminate customer credit risk, and to the extent FFG’s policies and procedures prove to be
inadequate, it could negatively affect FFG’s financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
some of FFG’s customers, particularly in emerging markets, may be subject to their own operating and
regulatory risks and, even if FFG’s credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, it may
experience financial losses in its dealings with such parties. FFG does not maintain credit insurance to
insure against customer credit risk. If FFG’s customers fail to fulfil their contractual obligations, FFG’s
business, financial condition and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.

FFG is also subject to credit risk with respect to its third-party suppliers. If any such suppliers become
insolvent, an appointed trustee could potentially ignore the service contracts FFG has in place with
such party, resulting in increased charges or the termination of the service contracts. FFG may not be
able to replace a service provider within a reasonable period of time, on as favorable terms or without
disruption to its operations.

**_FFG’s business depends on its ability to protect its intellectual property effectively and any_**
**_inability to protect its intellectual property could harm the value of FFG’s brands and adversely_**
**_affect its business._**

FFG’s business depends substantially on the legal protection of proprietary rights in intellectual
property that it owns or licenses. FFG also claims proprietary rights in various patented and unpatented
technologies, know-how, trade secrets (including formulas), trademarks and service marks relating to
its products and manufacturing processes. FFG’s ability to implement its business plan depends in part
on its ability to expand brand recognition using trademarks, service marks and other proprietary
intellectual property, including for its brand names and logos, and on its ability to exploit its proprietary
knowledge with respect to manufacturing processes. If existing contractual measures fail to protect
FFG’s proprietary rights, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes its intellectual property
(including by reverse-engineering FFG’s products or manufacturing processes), any advantage those
proprietary rights provide may be negated and the value of FFG’s brands may be harmed, which could
have a material adverse effect on its business and might prevent its brands from achieving or
maintaining market acceptance. Moreover, as FFG moves into new and additional distribution
channels for its products, such as foodservice and private label, and as FFG manages turnover of
employees over time, it may become increasingly difficult for FFG to fully protect its intellectual
property (including trade secrets and know-how).

Monitoring infringement of intellectual property rights is difficult and FFG cannot be certain that the
precautions it has taken will prevent the unauthorized use of its intellectual property (including trade
secrets and know-how), particularly in countries where it does not have trademarks or patents at all or
where the laws of such country may not protect its proprietary rights as adequately as the laws of the
European Union or the United States. As FFG expands its operations into new markets, it becomes
increasingly exposed to intellectual property laws which may prove to be inadequate for protecting its
rights. Accordingly, other parties, including competitors, may duplicate FFG products using its
proprietary technologies.

Pursuing legal remedies against persons infringing FFG’s owned or licensed intellectual property rights
or otherwise improperly using its proprietary information is a costly and time-consuming process that
could divert resources from the conduct of FFG’s business. When FFG or its licensor seeks to enforce
their respective intellectual property rights, defendants are permitted to challenge the validity of the
relevant intellectual property, which could have the impact of invalidating or limiting the scope of FFG’s
owned or licensed intellectual property, which may cause harm to its image, brand or competitive
position. In addition, patent infringement cases can involve hearings in which the court determines the
boundaries of the patent in dispute, which could limit the utility of FFG’s or its licensor’s patents.

FFG relies on a combination of registered trademark rights and common law rights or unfair
competition protection (which in each case may offer less protection than registered trademarks) to
protect FFG’s brands in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. There can be no assurance that

49


-----

FFG will be able to enforce these rights for current products, or register trademarks or obtain common
law or unfair competition protection in relation to its brands (such as “Flora,” “Becel,” “I Can’t Believe
It’s Not Butter!,” “Country Crock,” “Rama” or “Blue Band”) for any new product lines FFG may
introduce. As FFG expands its product lines, it may need to apply for additional trademark protection.
Any failure by FFG to maintain and extend protection of its intellectual property could adversely affect
its business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Adverse developments with respect to the safety or quality of products of the spreads industry_**
**_in general or of FFG’s products specifically, as well as evolving nutritional and health-related_**
**_concerns, may damage FFG’s reputation, increase its costs of operations and decrease_**
**_demand for its products._**

Food safety, and the public’s awareness that FFG’s products are safe and healthy, are essential to
FFG’s image and business. FFG sells food products for human consumption, which subjects it to
safety risks such as product contamination, spoilage, misbranding or product tampering. Product
contamination, including the presence of a foreign object, substance, chemical or other agent or
residue could require product withdrawals or recalls or the destruction of inventory, and could result in
negative publicity, temporary plant closures and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. FFG is
also subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread
contamination. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products in response
to public health concerns and consumers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy.

FFG may be harmed by publicity concerning any assertion that its products caused illness or injury,
and could become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness stemming from
product contamination or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of its products.
Any significant lawsuit or widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of consumer
confidence in the safety and quality of FFG’s products could damage its brand, reputation and image
and negatively affect its sales, profitability and prospects for growth. In addition, product recalls are
difficult to foresee and prepare for and, in the event FFG is required to recall one or more of its
products, such recall may result in damage to our brands’ image, loss of sales and diversion of
management’s time and attention. FFG maintains systems designed to monitor food safety risks and
requires its suppliers to do so as well. However, FFG cannot guarantee that its efforts will be
successful or that such risks will not materialize. In addition, although FFG attempts, through
contractual relationships and regular inspections, to control the risk of contamination caused by third
parties in relation to the manufacturing and distribution processes it outsources, FFG cannot guarantee
that its efforts will be successful or that contamination of its products by third parties will not
materialize.

FFG could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury or death
stemming from the consumption of a misbranded, altered, contaminated or spoiled product, which
could negatively affect FFG’s business. Awards of damages, settlement amounts and fees and
expenses resulting from such claims and the public relations implications of any such claims could
have an adverse effect on FFG’s business. The availability and price of insurance to cover claims for
damages are subject to market forces that FFG does not control, and such insurance may not cover all
the costs of such claims and would not cover damage to its reputation. Even if product liability claims
against FFG are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time consuming,
increase FFG’s insurance premiums and divert management’s time and resources towards defending
them rather than operating the business. In addition, any adverse publicity concerning such claims,
even if unfounded, could cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of FFG’s
products and damage its reputation and brand image.

Evolving nutritional and health-related concerns have led to negative publicity in the food industry
concerning the health implications of GMOs, palm oil, obesity, trans fat, diacetyl and artificial growth
hormones. In particular, the food industry has been experiencing a significant trend in which an
increasing number of consumers are requiring only non-GMO and other specialized ingredients in their
foods. Legislation could also require companies to move to non-GMO labelling or other higher cost
ingredients. This could result in changes to FFG’s labelling, advertising and/or packaging or require it
to purchase non-GMO ingredients, which would increase its costs. Sourcing non-GMO and other
specialized ingredients increases costs because such raw materials are generally less widely available
and therefore more expensive and FFG may not be able to increase its prices to reflect this increased

50


-----

cost. As additional retailers require or consider requiring all of their products to be non-GMO, additional
pressure may come to bear on manufacturers to find sources of raw materials which are non-GMO.
This may be particularly difficult in the United States, where most farmers produce genetically modified
foods, causing it to be difficult to source non-GMO ingredients and raw materials. Companies that fail
to source non-GMO and other specialized ingredients could, over time, lose market share, suffer harm
to their brand images and face decreasing sales. Consumers may increasingly require that foods meet
stricter standards than are required by applicable governmental agencies, which would further increase
the cost of manufacturing such foods and ingredients.

**_Seasonal fluctuations in product demand may affect the business_**

FFG’s sales have historically been affected by seasonal cyclicality in customer orders in various
markets. The extent and impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which FFG
operates. For example, the U.S. business typically experiences three “peaks” in sales during the year:
a spike in the fourth quarter which is driven by Christmas baking, an increase in sales in the first
quarter due to Easter, and a spike in sales during the third quarter due to “back to school” baking.
Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak in margarine use for cooking and baking during the Ramadan
festival season, which can occur in various quarters from year to year. Furthermore, across all the
countries in which we operate, the timing of product promotions drives volatility from normal
consumption. Finally, weather has some limited impact on sales, because hot weather reduces
consumer appetite for spreads products. While FFG’s sales are seasonal, many of the business’s
expenses, such as personnel costs, are incurred more evenly throughout the year, which could affect
measures of profitability in the short term and put pressure on our working capital position. Also, for
these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a reliable indication of the performance of
the business or how it may perform in the future.

**_Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect FFG’s business._**

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, FFG is subject to litigation. There is no
guarantee that FFG will be successful in defending itself in civil, criminal or regulatory actions. These
actions may relate to commercial, employment, environmental, food quality, food safety, anti-trust,
international trade, taxation, intellectual property and advertising and similar matters. For example,
FFG’s marketing could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could
result in litigation and potential liabilities or costs. In addition, FFG could incur substantial costs and
fees in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements.
The costs and other effects of potential litigation and administrative actions against FFG, and new legal
requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations.

**_FFG’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a_**
**_result of unstable political conditions, civil unrest, volatile or unfavorable economic conditions_**
**_or other developments and risks in emerging markets._**

Emerging markets are a significant part of FFG’s business strategy and the emerging markets in which
FFG operates, including Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and other nations in Latin America,
Africa, the Middle East and Asia, have experienced and may continue to experience unstable political
environments and volatile or unfavorable economic conditions.

There can be no assurance that FFG will be able to maintain or grow its sales and profitability in
emerging markets. Such inability may be caused by any one or more of the following factors:

    - unfavorable economic conditions, including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax
rates; highly inflationary currency, devaluation or fluctuation; contraction in the availability of
credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government
initiatives, including austerity or stimulus measures, to manage economic conditions and any
changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the
credit worthiness of the countries in which FFG’s products are sold or of countries that may
then impact countries in which FFG’s products are sold;

    - reduced demand for FFG’s products resulting from volatility in general global economic
conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional,
local or private label products or other lower-cost products, or to less profitable channels;

51


-----

    - unstable political or social conditions, including a lack of well-established or reliable legal
systems; or

    - acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest.

These factors may reduce demand for FFG’s products in emerging markets, including by changing
consumer preferences and reducing discretionary spending levels, as well as negatively impact FFG’s
ability to operate its business in such markets, including through restrictions on advertisements of its
products and the nationalization or government-mandated closure of FFG’s local manufacturing
facilities and assets or those of its third-party suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. In addition,
even in Emerging Markets where FFG operates profitably, foreign exchange controls, capital controls
and other limitations on the convertibility and flow of currency may restrict FFG’s ability to repatriate its
earnings from such countries, which would hamper its ability to deploy its capital most effectively.

Conditions in the emerging markets from which FFG sources certain key raw materials, including palm
oil, may also adversely affect FFG’s business, in particular if they result in restrictions on the purchase
and sale, or otherwise limit the availability, of such raw materials. In addition, FFG may become subject
to new or increased sanctions against, or other regulations restricting economic contact with, the
emerging markets in which it has a presence or otherwise sources its raw materials. FFG may also
incur increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex and evolving foreign and U.S.
laws and regulations that apply to FFG’s international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.

If FFG is unable to expand its businesses in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or
manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital FFG
expects from its investments in these markets, its business, financial condition or results of operations
could be adversely affected.

**_FFG is exposed to local business and tax risks in many different countries._**

FFG operates in numerous countries across Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, the Middle
East and Asia. As a result, FFG’s business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal, political,
social and regulatory requirements, economic conditions and unforeseeable developments in these
markets, all or any of which could result in disruption of its activities. These risks include, among
others, political instability, differing economic cycles and adverse economic conditions, unexpected
changes in regulatory environments, currency exchange rate fluctuations, inability to collect payments
or seek recourse under or comply with ambiguous or vague commercial or other laws, changes in
distribution and supply channels, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds,
and difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees. FFG’s overall success
in the markets in which it operates depends, to a considerable extent, on its ability to effectively
manage differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements, economic conditions and
unforeseeable developments. FFG cannot guarantee that it will succeed in developing and
implementing policies and strategies which will be effective in each location where it does business.

FFG must comply with complex and evolving tax regulations in the various jurisdictions in which it
operates, which subjects it to international tax compliance risks. Some tax jurisdictions in which FFG
operates have complex and subjective rules regarding income tax, value-added tax, sales or excise tax
and transfer tax. From time to time, FFG’s foreign subsidiaries are subject to tax audits and may be
required to pay additional taxes, interest or penalties should the taxing authority assert different
interpretations, or different allocations or valuations of its services which could be material and could
reduce FFG’s income and cash flow from its international subsidiaries.

**_FFG is exposed to risks associated with its growth and business development initiatives._**

FFG’s business can be affected by risks related to expansion into new international markets,
particularly emerging markets and the development of new products. FFG is also exposed to
reputational risks connected to a potential failure to manage and properly implement these growth
initiatives.

New international markets could develop more slowly than we expect at any given time. Entry into a
new market may require a local manufacturing or distribution partner, which may be difficult to obtain or

52


-----

slow down the speed of expansion. Should further expansion into international markets not be
successful or not be as successful as planned, the investments made might not result in the desired
growth in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We will also seek to expand FFG’s product offering into adjacent categories and distribution channels,
including additional DCA products and the foodservice and industrial distribution channels. There can
be no assurance that any new product line or channel which FFG might expand into will develop into a
viable offering, or that any investment made in expanding into such adjacent product categories or
distribution channels will be adequately rewarded.

Growth can carry risks relating to the adequacy of FFG’s resources and the capacity of management
and employees to properly manage all critical issues, resulting in a focus on certain initiatives to the
detriment of others and a failure to properly anticipate risks to our global supply chain. Growth risks
also include risks related to potential mergers and acquisitions, including potential liability under
acquisition agreements, product liability and environmental responsibility risks as well as reputational
and personnel related risks. The success of any merger or acquisition is also dependent on our
management’s ability to successfully integrate such companies into existing operations. Any failure to
manage risks related to potential mergers and acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on
FFG’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_The nature of the exit of the U.K. from the EU could adversely impact FFG’s business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

In the year ended December 31, 2017, 46% of FFG’s turnover was derived from the European Union
(excluding the United Kingdom) and 8% was derived from the United Kingdom. On June 23, 2016, the
U.K. electorate voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and on
March 29, 2017 the U.K. government formally initiated the withdrawal process. The terms of any
withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last until March 2019; thus, the referendum
has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the
European Union.

Since the Brexit referendum, the pound sterling has experienced increased volatility, particularly versus
the U.S. dollar and Euro, as a result of which FFG has experienced adverse impacts on consumer
demand and suppliers’ profitability in the U.K. and other markets. For example, in the first quarter of
2017, negotiations with large retail customers in a number of developed markets (including the U.K.)
were unusually prolonged due to price increases implemented by Unilever in response to the
heightened commodity price environment, which was exacerbated in the U.K. by the fall in the value of
the pound sterling after the Brexit referendum. While the situation was resolved in the second half of
2017 (albeit with some lasting impact on full year financial performance), there can be no assurance
that similar issues will not arise in future years.

In addition, Brexit has introduced general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which FFG
operates. Depending on the terms of Brexit, the United Kingdom could also lose access to the EU
single market and beneficial terms, resulting in an adverse impact on the general and economic
conditions in the United Kingdom. FFG also faces the risk that raw materials and finished products
imported into the U.K. will face tariffs after Brexit is implemented. Changes may occur in regulations
that FFG is required to comply with as well as amendments to treaties governing tax, duties and tariffs,
among other things, which could adversely impact its operations and require it to modify its financial
and supply arrangements. Additionally, political instability in the European Union as a result of Brexit
may have a material negative effect on credit markets and foreign direct investments in the EU and
U.K. This deterioration in economic conditions could result in increased unemployment rates,
increased short- and long-term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, a decline in
the strength of national and local economies, and other results that negatively impact household
incomes. Further, a number of FFG’s employees in the U.K. are not U.K. citizens and, depending on
the terms negotiated, may no longer have the right to work in the U.K. following the U.K.’s formal
withdrawal from the EU. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG is dependent upon key executives and qualified managers and it cannot assure their_**
**_retention._**

FFG’s success depends, in part, upon the continued services of key members of its management. FFG
executives’ and managers’ knowledge of the market, FFG’s business and its company represents a
key strength of its business, which cannot be easily replicated. The success of FFG’s business
strategy and its future growth also depends on its ability to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled
managerial, sales, administration, development and operating personnel.

There can be no assurance that FFG will be able to hire or retain experienced, qualified employees to
carry out FFG’s strategy, in particular following the separation from Unilever and the expiry of the
TSAs. Operating our business separately from Unilever’s broader infrastructure and its resources could
present operational and organizational challenges to our senior management team, and the separation
process from Unilever will divert management time and attention from the day-to-day requirements of
FFG’s business. The loss of one or more of its key management or operating personnel, or the failure
to attract and retain additional key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Costs or liabilities relating to compliance with applicable directives, regulations and laws could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations._**

As a producer of food products for human consumption, FFG is subject to extensive regulations in the
countries in which it operates, in particular the U.S.A. and EU, which govern production, composition,
manufacturing, storage, transport, advertising, packaging, health, quality, labelling, safety and
distribution standards. Regulations of the European Parliament and Council published in October 2011
changed rules relating to the presentation of nutritional information on packaging and other rules on
labelling. It is unclear how this will be impacted by Brexit but there may be changes and further
regulations to which FFG will be required to adhere. Local governmental authorities also set out health
and safety related conditions and restrictions. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and
regulations could subject FFG to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, product recalls or asset
seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the regulatory environment
could also lead to increased costs.

In addition, FFG’s manufacturing facilities as well as those of its suppliers and third-party
manufacturers are subject to licensing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous
governmental authorities. These governmental authorities include national and local health,
environmental, labor relations, sanitation, building, zoning, and fire and safety departments. Difficulties
in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licenses or approval could delay or prevent the
development, expansion or operation of a given production or warehouse facility. Any changes in those
regulations may require FFG to implement new quality controls and possibly invest in new equipment,
which could delay the development of new products and increase FFG’s operating costs.

All of FFG’s products must comply with strict national and international hygiene regulations. FFG’s
facilities and its suppliers’ facilities are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with
hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability
of genetically modified organisms and other raw materials. Despite the precautions FFG undertakes,
should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection or otherwise,
authorities may temporarily shut down any of FFG’s facilities and levy a fine for such non-compliance,
which could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Finally, any attempt to expand production may attract the scrutiny of European and other competition
and anti-trust regulators, and such an attempt may not succeed. In addition, FFG’s size and
prominence in the B&M market may prompt heightened scrutiny by such regulators seeking to restrain
anti-competitive market practices. Any competition or anti-trust investigation could require significant
legal expenditures and result in liabilities or adverse governmental orders. Such developments could
adversely affect FFG’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG could incur material costs to address violations of, or liabilities under, health, safety and_**
**_environmental regulations._**

FFG’s facilities and operations are subject to numerous health, safety and environmental regulations,
including local and national laws, U.S. federal and state legislation and regulations, and European
directives and regulations governing, among other things, water supply and use, water discharges, air
emissions, chemical safety, solid and hazardous waste management and disposal, clean-up of
contamination, energy use, noise pollution, and workplace health and safety. Health, safety and
environmental legislation in Europe, the United States and elsewhere have generally become more
comprehensive and restrictive and more rigid over time and enforcement has become more stringent.
Failure to comply with applicable requirements, or the terms of required permits, can result in penalties
or fines, clean-up costs, third-party property damage and personal injury claims, which could have a
material adverse effect on FFG’s brand, business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, if health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which FFG
operates or from which it sources raw materials and ingredients become more stringent in the future,
the extent and timing of investments required to maintain compliance may exceed FFG’s budget or
estimates and may limit the availability of funding for other investments.

Furthermore, under some environmental laws, FFG could be liable for costs incurred in investigating or
remediating contamination at its facilities, even if the contamination was caused by an unrelated party,
and even if the activity which caused the contamination was legal at the time it occurred. The discovery
of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new or more burdensome obligations to
investigate or remediate contamination at FFG’s properties or at third-party sites, could result in
substantial unanticipated costs which could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In certain jurisdictions, FFG is also subject to legislation designed to significantly reduce industrial
energy use, carbon dioxide emissions and the emission of ozone depleting compounds more
generally. If FFG fails to meet applicable standards for energy use reduction or is unable to decrease,
and in some cases eliminate, certain emissions within the applicable period required by relevant laws
and regulations, it could be subject to significant penalties or fines and temporary or long-term
disruptions to production at its facilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on FFG’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG is exposed to foreign exchange rate risks and such rates may adversely affect its results_**
**_of operations._**

FFG is exposed to translational and transactional foreign exchange rate risk. FFG is exposed to
translational foreign exchange risk as FFG’s reporting currency is the euro but a significant proportion
of its sales are denominated in the various currencies of the countries in which it sells its products;
65% of FFG’s turnover in the year ending December 31, 2017 was denominated in currencies other
than the euro. FFG does not currently hedge against this translational foreign exchange risk. FFG is
also exposed to transactional foreign exchange risk due to the fact that a significant portion of its raw
material purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars or are otherwise heavily influenced by U.S. dollar
fluctuations, for example the price of plastic packaging materials, even if quoted in euros or some other
currency, is influenced by crude oil prices which are set in dollars. FFG intends to reduce this risk by
hedging it’s major currency exposures; however, such hedging arrangements may not fully protect
FFG against currency fluctuations. Fluctuations and sustained strengthening of the U.S. dollar
exchange rate against FFG’s operating currencies may materially adversely affect its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_FFG may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._**

While FFG seeks to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all exposures are insurable and FFG
may experience major incidents of a nature that are not covered by its insurance. FFG’s insurance
policies cover, among other things, employee-related accidents and injuries, property damage and
liability deriving from its activities. FFG maintains an amount of insurance protection that it believes is
adequate, but there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on
acceptable terms or that FFG’s insurance coverage will be sufficient or effective under all
circumstances and against all liabilities to which it may be subject. FFG could, for example, be subject

55


-----

to substantial claims for damages upon the occurrence of several events within one calendar year. In
addition, FFG’s insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in its
claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general.

**_Due to restrictions on the deduction of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry-forwards_**
**_under Dutch law, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

The gross proceeds of this Offering, together with borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and the Shareholder Contribution, will be used by FFG to (i) finance the Acquisition and (ii) pay costs,
expenses and fees in connection with the Transactions. The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes
semi-annually in arrears. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Dutch tax law does not provide
for interest deduction restrictions with respect to third party debt taken up by the Issuer, the proceeds
of which are used to grant interest-bearing loans. Interest payments to the holders of the Notes are not
subject to Dutch dividend withholding tax.

According to the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, the Netherlands must introduce an interest
deductibility limitation rule effective from January 1, 2019. Under such rule, net interest due in excess
of 30% of the Issuer’s EBITDA is not deductible in that calendar year. Net interest due means interest
income minus interest expenses. Furthermore, the Dutch government has announced that Dutch
financial institutions, which generally realize a positive interest margin and should thus not be affected
by the new 30% EBITDA rule, may become subject to thin capitalization legislation. If the Issuer is
affected by either of the aforementioned provisions, the Issuer may no longer be able to (fully) deduct
the interest expenses due to the holders of the Notes as a result of which the Dutch corporate income
tax burden may increase. The Dutch tax rate is currently 25% (a reduced rate applies to the first
€200,000 of taxable profit).

In addition, the Dutch government has announced its intention to introduce a withholding tax on
interest payments to lenders resident in low tax countries and non-cooperative countries, as listed by
the European Commission. Such withholding tax may be introduced in 2020 or 2021.

**_Transfer pricing rules may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results_**
**_of operations._**

Certain of our subsidiaries have business relationships with other companies of FFG. Under certain
(corporate) income and trade tax law, such intra-group relationships are required to meet arm’s length
terms. If intra-group relationships are not agreed on an arm’s length basis, certain tax authorities may
in particular accept the deduction of business expenses for tax purposes only to the extent the
business expenses would have been incurred in case of an arm’s length relationship. Under certain
circumstances, intra-group performances that do not meet arm’s length terms may also be re-qualified
as deemed dividends. These consequences would negatively impact our financial condition and results
of operations.

With respect to business relationships between companies of FFG established in different jurisdictions,
certain tax authorities may request proper transfer pricing documentation from the relevant Group
company. Such transfer pricing documentation may also be requested by certain tax authorities with
respect to the allocation of profits between companies of FFG established in different jurisdictions. If no
proper transfer pricing documentation is delivered to the tax authority in a timely manner upon such
request, the tax authorities may adjust the taxable income of the relevant company. In this case, an
additional surcharge may also be applied by the tax authority.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_Creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations that we_**
**_may enter into are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any_**
**_enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes._**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be secured by liens over the Collateral on the basis
and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral, together with certain other assets not
pledged in favor of the Notes, also secures our obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement. In addition, the Collateral may secure certain hedging obligations which we may enter into.
The Indenture also permits the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in
accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and
certain hedging obligations will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral

56


-----

pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a
foreclosure on the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then-outstanding
claims under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations are greater than
the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will,
after all obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations and any
other such obligations sharing the Collateral have been discharged in full, be applied pro rata in
repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral on an equal basis with the
Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who will also serve as the
security agent for the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, certain hedging
arrangements and any additional secured debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.

In general, lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and any other permitted future senior
secured debt will have, subject to certain restrictions, the ability to provide enforcement instructions to
the Security Agent to enforce the shared Collateral. Such creditors may have interests that are different
from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be
disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement by security
interests in the Collateral, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement. The Collateral may also secure additional debt, to the extent permitted by the
terms of the Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Collateral may also be released or otherwise reduced in the future. For example, some of the shares of
Midco that comprise part of the Collateral could be sold in a transaction that is not prohibited by the
Indenture. Similarly, the principal amount of the Proceeds Loan from the Issuer to Midco, which also
comprises part of the Collateral, could be reduced through repayment or the terms of the Proceeds
Loan could be amended. Your rights to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the first-priority
debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale,
the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book
value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a
portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise,
we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market
exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, some or all of the
Collateral may be of no value if Midco is subject to insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other
creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or
after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well
as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the priority
of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral will be subject to practical problems
generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. The Security Agent may also
need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the
Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of
any third parties will be given when required to enforce the Collateral. Accordingly, the Security Agent
may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may in the
meantime significantly decrease. Furthermore, the security interests may be subject to certain

57


-----

limitations on enforcement or may be limited by applicable law or may be subject to certain defenses
that may limit its validity or enforceability. For additional information relating to limitations on
enforceability of Collateral and enforcement proceedings generally, see “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

In addition, our business requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. The continued
operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of
such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted following a change in ownership in an
enforcement scenario. Our business is subject to regulations and permit requirements and may be
adversely affected if we are unable to comply with applicable regulations or requirements. In the event
of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked, the transfer of such permits and
licenses may be prohibited or may require us or the acquired in an enforcement scenario to incur
significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental
authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such
transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are practically or commercially prevented, the foreclosure
may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the
Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of the Netherlands; the Guarantors are organized under the
laws of the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom; and the Collateral will
include a pledge over the shares of Midco, which is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands,
and over the receivable from Midco under the Proceeds Loan. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency,
administration, restructuring or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to
insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will
be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings.

The insolvency, administrative and other laws of the jurisdictions of organization of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and, in certain circumstances,
with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental
and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceedings and preference
periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether,
and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights under the Guarantees and the Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Each Guarantee and the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to significant_**
**_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses_**
**_that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes on a senior subordinated basis. Each
Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. In addition, the Issuer will secure the payment of the Notes on the basis and priority set out
in the Intercreditor Agreement by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. Under the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and
counterparties to certain hedging agreements, and any additional indebtedness secured on the same
basis, will have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an
enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the
Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indenture will provide for general limitation language to the effect that each Guarantee
and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability or indemnification under a
Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed/secured by the
relevant Guarantor/security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of the
Guarantor/security provider without rendering the relevant Guarantee/security interest voidable or
otherwise ineffective under the applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee/Security Document
would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses include those that

58


-----

relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting
the rights of creditors generally. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations” for a description of certain of these_
limitations in several relevant jurisdictions. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable,
the relevant Guarantor may have no liability, or decreased liability, under its Guarantee.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other
laws, a court could subordinate or void the Guarantees or the security interest granted under the
Security Documents and, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee or enforcement
proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient return the payment to the
relevant Guarantor/security provider, if the court found that:

 - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law;

 - the relevant Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor/security provider or, in
certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor/security
provider was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest;

 - the Guarantor/security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value
for the relevant Guarantee/security interest and the Guarantor/security provider was: (i) insolvent
or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee/security interest; (ii) undercapitalized or
became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended
to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or

 - the relevant Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects/corporate
purposes of the Guarantor/security provider or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate
benefit of the Guarantor/security provider.

**_The security interest in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly_**
**_to the holders of the Notes and the Collateral will be granted subsequent to the issuance of the_**
**_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by_**
**_local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes will not be
granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The
Indenture will provide, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, that only the Security Agent has the right
to enforce the Security Documents. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Security
Documents may be restricted under local law. As a consequence of the right to enforce the Security
Documents, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to the
applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the
Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than
the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. Under German
law, to the extent accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheit) such as, for example, pledges over
shares, partnership interests, receivables or bank accounts is concerned, the relevant accessory
security interest can only be granted to the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured. As a
consequence, of such uncertainties or restrictions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the
creation of parallel debt (“Parallel Debt”) obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the
obligations of the Issuer and Guarantors towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with
the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Dutch law and the German law security interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security
for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. As a result, the holders of the
Notes will bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.
In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been fully tested under Dutch and German law and, to
the extent that the security interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are

59


-----

successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds
from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be released automatically,
including, without limitation:

 - in the case of Collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition to any third party of
Collateral, so long as the sale or other disposition is permitted by the Indenture or the Issuer to
any restricted subsidiary consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;

 - in accordance with the “Amendment and Waiver” provisions of the Indenture;

 - upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as provided under the caption
“Description of the Notes—Defeasance;”

 - with respect to the property and assets securing the Notes, automatically if a security interest
granted in favor of the other indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the security
interest over such property and assets pursuant to the covenant described under the caption
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” is released (other than
pursuant to the payment and discharge thereof);

 - in the case of the Collateral, in connection with an IPO Pushdown in accordance with the
Indenture;

 - in the case of the Collateral, in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “Description of the Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” or in connection with a Permitted Reorganization in_
accordance with the Indenture; or

 - in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Unless consented to by the holders of the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the Guarantees or security
interests in the Collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

 - for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash;

 - concurrently with the discharge or release of the indebtedness of the disposed entities of certain
other creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, unless each
agent for the senior creditors determines that the senior creditors will recover a greater amount if
any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser of the disposed entities and not
released and discharged; and

 - pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sales process, or a fairness opinion has been
obtained from a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral may be released and retaken in
connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Issuer has
confirmed in writing to the Security Agent that it has determined that it is either not possible or not
desirable to implement any such refinancing on terms satisfactory to the Issuer by instead granting
additional collateral and/or amending the terms of the existing Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, such a
release and retaking of collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of
such collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or
representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of the Collateral.
Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of the Collateral and
thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security_
_Interest.”_

Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the release of certain
collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (nachträgliche Übersicherung) (where the
value of the relevant security interest subsequently significantly and not only temporarily exceeds the

60


-----

amount of the secured obligations), or security interest can even be deemed void in case of an initial
excessive over-collateralization (anfängliche Übersicherung). It is a factual question whether the
security granted under the Collateral exceeds this limit.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security_**
**_interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its
priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the
security interest. The security interest in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims
of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any such security interest.
The Security Agent shall be under no obligation to perfect the Collateral.

Under Dutch law, a right of pledge over receivables can be created in two manners, by means of (i) a
disclosed right of pledge which is disclosed to the debtor, or (ii) an undisclosed right of pledge. A
disclosed and undisclosed right of pledge can both be created by means of a notarial deed or private
deed non-notarial agreement. As a general rule under Dutch law, disclosed rights of pledge are
created in respect of, inter alia, account receivables, insurance receivables, intercompany receivables
and hedging receivables, while undisclosed rights of pledge are created in respect of trade receivables.
A disclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment a debtor receives a notification of such right of
pledge. An undisclosed right of pledge is perfected at the moment that (a copy of) the agreement is
submitted to the Dutch tax authorities if such agreement is executed as a private deed or perfected at
the moment of execution, if such agreement is executed as a notarial deed. For undisclosed rights of
pledge over receivables, the relevant debtor may validly discharge its obligations under the relevant
pledged receivable by paying the pledgor. As soon as the debtor is notified of the right of pledge, the
debtor is only able to validly discharge its obligations by making payments to the pledgee. For more
information, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and
_Certain Insolvency Law considerations—The Netherlands.”_

Further, pursuant to the terms of certain security documents, actions for perfection of certain security
interests may only be undertaken following certain trigger events, such as notice of the occurrence of
an event of default under the Indenture that is continuing. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law considerations—The_
_Netherlands.”_

**_The granting of security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or delayed
perfection of certain security interests following certain trigger events under the Security Documents,
such as notice of the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture which is continuing, may
create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening
period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new security interest has
been granted, perfected or recreated (as applicable). In each such case, if the security interest
granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations.”_

Similar considerations also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession
of further subsidiaries as Target Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant
assets and equity interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

With respect to Dutch law, transactions can in certain circumstances be returned to a bankruptcy
estate or a company subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among
others, situations where the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor
to the detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings,
created a new security interest or provided a guarantee that was either not stipulated at the time when
the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not

considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value
of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of payment. In the majority of
situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during three or six
months preceding the commencement of the relevant Dutch insolvency proceedings. However, in
certain situations, longer time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. For more information,
see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations—The Netherlands—Fraudulent Transfer / conveyance.”_

**_The Guarantees will be subordinated to our existing and future senior debt and the Notes are_**
**_subject to restrictions on payment and enforcement._**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantees will be senior subordinated obligations of the
Guarantors and each will:

 - be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth below under “Summary—The
_Offering—Security;”_

 - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness,
including the guarantee given by the Issuer under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement;

 - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer;

 - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Notes on an equal basis, to the extent of the value of the
property or assets securing such indebtedness, including the guarantee given by the Issuer in
favor of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, and certain hedging obligations; and

 - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Issuer
that do not guarantee the Notes.

Payment under the Guarantees will be expressly subordinated in right of payment to the payment
when due of all Senior Indebtedness (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—
_Senior Indebtedness”) of the Guarantors (including indebtedness incurred under the Senior Credit_
Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations). As a result of this subordination, holders of
Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full payment on all obligations owed to
them before any payment can be made to holders of the Notes in respect of the Guarantees.

In addition, no enforcement action with respect to the Guarantees may be taken unless (subject to
certain limited exceptions): (i) any enforcement action has been taken with respect to senior secured
debt (provided the Trustee and holders of the Notes will be limited to taking the same action); (ii) an
insolvency event has occurred in relation to the Issuer; (iii) with respect to any enforcement action on a
Guarantee, an insolvency event has occurred with respect to the relevant Guarantor; (iv) there is a
default on the Notes outstanding after a period of 179 days after the date on which the agent with
respect to senior debt delivers written notice of such default; (v) a default has occurred resulting from a
failure to pay principal on the Notes at maturity; or (vi) the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement have given their consent to the proposed action. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Upon any distribution to the creditors of a Guarantor in a liquidation, administration, bankruptcy,
moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding up of such Guarantor, the holders of senior debt
of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to its
Guarantee. As a result, holders of the Notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of senior debt
of the Guarantors, including the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement contains significant restrictions with respect to payments of the
Notes. If there is a payment default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, or if a senior
payment stop notice is issued following a non-payment event of default under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, then payments by the Guarantors and the Issuer will not be permitted to be made
in respect of the Notes unless the payment is funded directly or indirectly with amounts which have not
been received by a Guarantor or the Issuer from another FFG company. In some circumstances, for
instance where payments were received on the Notes in breach of the Intercreditor Agreement, holders
would be required to turn over such payments to the Security Agent for redistribution. In addition,
although the holders of the Notes are generally entitled to enforce their claims against the Issuer
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement nevertheless places limits on
enforcement to the extent it would prejudice the enforcement by senior creditors of their security
granted by the Issuer. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

As of December 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Acquisition, we would have
had an aggregate principal amount of outstanding financial liabilities that ranked senior to the Notes
Guarantees of €3,954 million. See “Capitalization.”

**_The rights to enforce remedies with respect to the Collateral are limited as long as any senior_**
**_debt is outstanding._**

The security interests in all of the Collateral will rank behind the first-priority security interests in the
Collateral in favor of the creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging
obligations which we may enter into. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security
agent will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, certain hedging obligations, future senior secured indebtedness and the Notes, and will
(subject to certain limited exceptions) act with respect to such Collateral only at the direction of the
relevant instructing group of creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, future senior
secured indebtedness and certain hedging obligations until the amounts outstanding under such debt
instruments and hedging agreements are paid in full and discharged. Until the expiration of a standstill
period on enforcement of such security on behalf of holders of the Notes, the creditors under the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, future senior secured indebtedness and certain hedging obligations
will have (subject to certain limited exceptions) the exclusive right to make all decisions with respect to
the exercise of remedies relating to such Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” As a result, the holders of the Notes will not be able to force_
a sale of such Collateral, or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under
the relevant Security Documents, until the expiration of the applicable standstill period for so long as
any amounts under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, future senior secured indebtedness and
certain hedging obligations remain outstanding. The creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, future senior secured indebtedness and certain hedging obligations may have interests
that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes, and they may elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of
the Notes to do so. This may affect the ability of holders of the Notes to recover under the Collateral if
the proceeds from the Collateral, after having satisfied obligations under or in respect of the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement and certain hedging obligations, are less than the aggregate amount owed
in respect of the Notes and any other indebtedness secured by second-priority security interests on
such Collateral. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

In addition, if the creditors or the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or counterparties
to certain hedging agreements cause the sale of the shares of Midco or the shares of any of our
subsidiaries through an enforcement of their first-priority security interest in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantees and the liens over the Collateral securing the Notes
and each Guarantee may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The ability of holders of the Notes to recover under the security interests in the Collateral may_**
**_be limited._**

The security interests granted by the Issuer over its ownership interests in Midco and the Proceeds
Loan made by the Issuer to Midco shall be extended to secure the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes on the basis and priority set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. Security interests on an equal
and ratable first-priority basis in such Collateral have been granted for the benefit of creditors under the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement as well as counterparties to certain hedging agreements which way
may enter into. Holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral because the creditors
under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements will
have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such security interests and any
enforcement sale with respect to such Collateral, and the Notes will need to share any remaining
proceeds from such enforcement with any other secured creditors. If the proceeds realized from the
enforcement of such security interests or such sale or sales exceed the amount owed under the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement and certain of our hedging obligations, any excess amount of such
proceeds will be paid to the Trustee on behalf of itself and the registered holder of the Notes for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes. If there are no excess proceeds, or if the amount of such excess
proceeds is less than the aggregate amount of the obligations under the Notes, the holders of the
Notes will not fully recover (if at all) under such Collateral.

63


-----

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, until the expiration of a standstill period on enforcement of
security on behalf of the holders of the Notes, the Trustee, the Security Agent and holders of the Notes
will (subject to certain limited exceptions) not be able to force a sale of the Collateral securing the
Notes or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security
Documents relating to such Collateral for so long as any amounts under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement and certain of our hedging agreements remain outstanding and, if the creditors under the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement enforce their security, they together with the counterparties to
certain hedging agreements will have priority over the holders of the Notes with respect to the
proceeds from this Collateral. See “—The rights to enforce remedies with respect to the Collateral are
_limited as long as any senior debt is outstanding.” As such, holders of the Notes may not be able to_
recover on the Collateral if the claims of the creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and
certain hedging obligations are greater than the proceeds realized from any enforcement of the
Collateral. In addition, if the creditors or the agent under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement cause
the sale of the shares of Midco or the shares of any of our subsidiaries through an enforcement of their
first-priority security interest, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Guarantees and the liens over any other assets and the Proceeds Loan securing the Notes may be
released. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement”_ and
“Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Dollar Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars and the Euro Notes will be
denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a
currency other than U.S. dollars or euros, respectively, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
U.S. dollar or euro relative to any such other currency because of economic, political and other factors
over which we have no control. Depreciation of the U.S. dollar or euro against any such other currency
could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could
result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into any such other currency.
Investments in the Notes by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result of
foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_The insolvency laws of the Netherlands or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of the_**
**_Guarantors may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude_**
**_holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative
laws of several jurisdictions and you may not be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex,
multiple bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The Notes will be issued by Sigma Holdco B.V., which
is organized under the laws of the Netherlands, and may be guaranteed by entities formed or
incorporated in the Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. In the event of a
bankruptcy or insolvency event, proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands, the United States,
Germany, the United Kingdom or in one or more other jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are
domiciled. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly and otherwise may
result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. The bankruptcy laws
of these jurisdictions may be less favorable to your interests as a creditor than the bankruptcy laws of
the U.S.A. or any other jurisdiction you may be familiar with, including in respect of priority of creditors,
the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the ability to influence proceedings and the duration thereof,
and this may limit your ability to receive payments due on the Notes. In the event that any one or more
of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of our subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. The insolvency and other laws of different jurisdictions may be materially different from,
or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability
to void preferential transfer and certain other transactions, priority of governmental and other creditors,
ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or
any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should
apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the

64


-----

Collateral in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. In addition, in actions
brought in countries outside of the United States, courts may choose to apply their own law rather than
the law of the State of New York, which governs the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees. The
application of foreign law may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the
Guarantees.

See also “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations” for additional information on the insolvency laws of the European_
Union, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and a majority of the subsidiaries of the Issuer, including the Guarantors, are organized
outside the United States, and their business is conducted primarily outside the United States.
Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws or under the Indenture, you may be unable to
effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer
and the Guarantors. In addition, because a majority of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and
their respective subsidiaries and all or a majority of the assets of their directors and executive officers
are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S.
courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil
liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Enforcement of Civil
_Liabilities.”_

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with
the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability
in such countries of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S.
judgment in such countries. In addition, the enforcement in such countries of any judgment obtained in
a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws,
will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in any of the foregoing countries
would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in
such country on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further information see “Enforcement
_of Civil Liabilities.”_

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the_**
**_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the_**
**_Indenture and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily_**
**_afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “Change of Control”, the Issuer would be required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof on the date of repurchase plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If
a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available
at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price
of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture or the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement or other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required
repurchases. A Change of Control may result in a requirement to offer to prepay loans under, an event
of default under, or acceleration of, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and other indebtedness. The
repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness,
even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash to allow it to pay
cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our
then existing financial resources.

In addition, under the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, in certain circumstances we are
required to cancel all commitments and repay all amounts borrowed under such agreement. Sufficient
funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting
a Change of Control occurs at a time when FFG is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the
purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness

65


-----

to the repurchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited
from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that FFG
would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to repurchase the Notes would
constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
_Control.”_

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be
deemed not to be a Change of Control if at the time our consolidated leverage ratio is less than certain
specified levels. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

The Change of Control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events
may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a
“Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to_
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization
or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all
or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it
may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

Upon consummation of the Transactions, including the issuance of the Notes, we will have a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As at December 31, 2017, on a
_pro forma basis for the Transactions, our pro forma total net debt would have been €5,385.7 million._
See “Summary Historical and Other Financial Information.” In addition, we are able to draw an
additional €700 million of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility subject to certain conditions.
Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations and for
holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

 - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other
debts and liabilities;

 - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our
debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, organic growth projects
and for other general corporate purposes;

 - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry
conditions;

 - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or
greater financial resources than we have;

 - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and
industry;

 - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

 - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

 - limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the
future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

66


-----

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our
debt and to fund acquisitions, working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our
future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash
from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory
factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash
flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or to fund our future acquisitions or
other working capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in
connection with future acquisitions. The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the
Indenture will permit our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain limitations. If new debt is
added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. For a discussion of our
cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our
debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business.

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Indenture and the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are
subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the
amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.
Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes or may
be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes and the Guarantees. In addition, the Indenture
and our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute debt under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the
leverage-related risks described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants which limit our operating, strategic and financial_**
**_flexibility._**

Our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and/or the Indenture will contain covenants which impose
significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to (in each case,
subject to customary exceptions and carve-outs):

 - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

 - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

 - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures or undertaking
capital expenditures;

 - prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

 - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

 - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

 - agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

 - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

 - sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis;

 - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries;

 - impair the Security Interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and

 - create or incur certain liens.

These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to
market conditions or regulatory developments or take advantage of potential business opportunities as
they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations,
pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs
or such acquisitions.

67


-----

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement or the_**
**_Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default_**
**_which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will require us to comply with various
covenants, including a springing financial covenant in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility requiring
us to maintain a specified leverage ratio and which is tested on the last date of each financial quarter
provided that the aggregate amount of outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is equal to
or greater than 40% of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at that time. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to
meet this financial ratio could be affected by deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events
beyond our control, including, without limitation, unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot
assure you that we will be able to meet this ratio. Moreover, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
includes certain events of default (including, amongst other things, events of default for breaches of
representations and warranties and an event of default for our failure to make principal payments when
due on certain other debt) that are in addition to the events of default set forth in the Indenture. Subject
to a clean-up period lasting until the date falling four months after the first utilization date
(or four months following a permitted acquisition), if an event of default occurs and is continuing under
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, this could result in, amongst other things, termination of any
available facilities, canceling any undrawn commitments and declaring all amounts borrowed, together
with accrued and unpaid interest and any other sums then payable, to be immediately due and
payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Notes, that contain cross-acceleration
or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand in the event that
acceleration occurs under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. In these circumstances, our assets
and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt and our other debt, including the Notes
then outstanding, if some or all of these instruments were accelerated, which could force us into
bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an
event.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sustain our operations,_**
**_including due to factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy_**
**_our debt obligations, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Notes or our other debt obligations, and to fund
working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to
generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient
to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debt, including the Notes, or to fund our
liquidity needs. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to
pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

 - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

 - sell assets;

 - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

 - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms,
if at all.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition
at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and
may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business
operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may restrict us from
adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and
even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable

68


-----

to us. If we are not able to refinance our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the
Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default
or cross-acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient
funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding debt on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur
additional debt. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt
service and other obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the Indenture, restrict our ability to
transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that
we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from
asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries and_**
**_effectively subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes._**

Certain of our subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. Our subsidiaries will not have any obligations
to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee
the Notes or grant Security Interests in this respect. Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors
of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to
payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available
for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

 - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and

 - the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled
to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer
or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions
from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each related Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Markets in
which our subsidiaries will not guarantee the notes generated 57% of our turnover for the year ended
December 31, 2017, and held 53% of our total assets as at December 31, 2017. Our subsidiaries
which we expect will not guarantee the Notes had an immaterial amount of third party financial
indebtedness. This amount will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees. The
Indenture, subject to certain limitations, will permit these non-Guarantors to incur additional
indebtedness, which may also be secured.

Any of the debt that our non-guarantor subsidiaries incur in the future in accordance with the Indenture
will rank structurally senior to the Notes and the related Guarantees and any debt we incur that is
secured on property or assets that do not form part of the Collateral securing the Notes will be
effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such
indebtedness.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a_**
**_comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives_
proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable
security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the International Stock Exchange Authority_**
**_Limited._**

Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted to trading thereon and to maintain such
listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become
or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to trading
thereon or it determines that it will not maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain
such listing on the Exchange, provided that it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized stock exchange, although there can
be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity
of the Notes as a result of listing on the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for
comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting
of the Notes from the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may
have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and_**
**_may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.
A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by
one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

 - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

 - your ability to sell your Notes; or

 - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for
the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is
subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract
different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the
market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on
you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there
is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange, there can be no assurances that the Notes will be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange and that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of
the listing, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission
to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange
may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary
market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act
or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the U.S. Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We have not
agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes or the Guarantees, and do not have any
intention to do so.

**_The Notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing system to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will be issued in fully registered form. The Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A
Global Notes will be deposited, on the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream (with respect to the Euro Notes) and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depositary, or a nominee of DTC (with respect to the Dollar Notes) and
registered in the name of the nominee of DTC.

Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests
through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected
only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, and their participants. Owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will not be entitled
to receive definitive notes in registered form, except under the limited circumstances described in
“Book-Entry, Delivery and Form—Definitive Registered Notes.” So long as the Notes are held in global
form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Global Notes.
DTC or its nominee, or the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or its nominee, as
applicable, will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes.

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest
and additional amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the relevant Paying Agent. The relevant
Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to DTC or the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. DTC or the common depositary, or its nominee, will in
turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to DTC
or the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, we will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the holders of BookEntry Interests. Accordingly, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC
or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and, if you are not a participant in DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, on the procedures of the participant through which you hold your interest,
to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the direct
right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from
holders of the Notes. Instead, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the
extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to
enable you to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest,
you will be restricted to acting through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures
to be implemented through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, may not be adequate to
ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**Risks Related to Ownership**

**_The interests of the Issuer’s principal shareholder may conflict with your interests._**

The interests of the Issuer’s principal shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your
interests as holders of the Notes. The Issuer is indirectly controlled by KKR. See “Principal
_Shareholders.” The Issuer’s shareholder is able to appoint its board of directors and to determine_
corporate strategy, management and policies. In addition, the Issuer’s shareholder has control over
decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that
requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such
transactions are in their own best interests. For example, the shareholder could vote to cause the
Issuer to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case,
so long as the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit.
The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Issuer’s debt service obligations and the
sale of certain assets could reduce its ability to generate turnover or, if the assets distributed or sold
are Notes Collateral, could reduce the amount of the asset sale proceeds available to repay the Notes,
each of which could adversely affect holders of the Notes.

Additionally, the Issuer’s shareholder is in the business of making investments in companies and may
from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with FFG.
The Issuer’s shareholder may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to
FFG’s business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to FFG. So long
as KKR continues to own a significant amount of the Issuer’s capital stock, even if such amount is less
than 50%, KKR will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control FFG’s decisions. The
interests of KKR may not coincide with your interests.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds of this Offering, together with borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and the Shareholder Contribution, will be used by FFG to (i) finance the Acquisition and (ii) pay costs,
expenses and fees in connection with the Transactions.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Acquisition and the other Transactions. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending
on several factors, including the Completion Date, the differences between the estimated and actual
amount of cash and working capital held (including due to recent trading), fluctuations in currency
exchange rates and the difference between estimated and actual fees and expenses.

For descriptions of our anticipated indebtedness following the offering of the Notes, see “Description of
_the Notes,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Capitalization.”_

Notes:
1) Our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for our Senior Term Facilities and our Revolving Credit Facility. The amount
here reflects term loan borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities that we expect will be drawn on or around the
Completion Date, including borrowings under: (i) a euro tranche in aggregate principal amount of €2,000 million; (ii) a U.S.
dollar tranche in aggregate principal amount of $875 million; (iii) a Polish złoty tranche in aggregate principal amount of
€475 million (equivalent); and (iv) a pound sterling tranche in aggregate principal amount of £445 million plus €300 million
(equivalent). The euro equivalent presented in the “Sources” column takes into account the U.S. dollar and pound sterling
forward currency arrangements which we have concluded in order to ensure the availability of the required amount of euros
on the Completion Date, under which we would be able to convert the proceeds of the U.S. dollar tranche to euros at a rate
no worse than $1.2712 per €1.00 and the proceeds of the £445 million portion of the pound sterling tranche to euros at a
rate no worse than £0.9072 per €1.00; foreign currency amounts presented in this footnote as euro equivalents (namely, the
Polish złoty tranche and the €300 million (equivalent) portion of the pound sterling tranche) are committed in euros as of the
date of this Offering Memorandum and will be converted to their final local currency amounts when drawn. For a description
of the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit
_Facilities Agreement.”_
On or about the Completion Date, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility temporarily to make a payment to
Unilever in respect of FFG’s net negative working capital position as further described below in note 3. This Revolving Credit
Facility drawing is not reflected in this table.
2) As part of the Transactions, KKR will indirectly contribute equity in an amount of €1,974 million to the Issuer. See “Summary
_Corporate and Financing Structure,” “Principal Shareholders” and “Capitalization.”_
3) Represents the purchase price payable to Unilever under the Acquisition Agreement on a cash-free, debt-free basis and
does not reflect the working capital payment which we expect to make to Unilever on or around the Completion Date. In
connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever (i) receivables associated with
sales of FFG’s products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) payables associated with raw materials received by FFG prior
to the Completion Date. We have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing the average net negative
working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and finished products conveyed
with the business on the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily our net negative working
capital position. We do not currently have a figure for this working capital payment but we estimate it to be in the range of
€350 million to €450 million. This is subject to change prior to the Completion Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_FFG’s Separation from Unilever—Following the separation, we will experience a temporary increase in our working capital_
_needs” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital_
_Resources.”_
4) Reflects estimated fees and expenses associated with the Offering, fees and expenses associated with the Acquisition, and
certain financing fees with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. These fees and expenses include customary
financial advisory and other transaction costs and customary professional expenses, as well as costs associated with foreign
currency hedges entered into in connection with the tranches of the Senior Term Facilities denominated in currencies other
than euro, Initial Purchasers’ fees, legal and accounting expenses and other transaction costs.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the cash and capitalization, (i) of FFG as at December 31, 2017 on an
actual combined carve-out basis; and (ii) of the Issuer on an adjusted basis to give effect to the
Transactions as described in “Use of Proceeds” as if they had occurred on December 31, 2017. The
adjusted information below is illustrative only and does not purport to be indicative of the Issuer’s
actual capitalization following completion of the Offering.

You should read the following table in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Historical
_Financial and Other Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results_ _of_ _Operations,”_ and the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. Except as set forth below, there have been no other material changes to the
capitalization of the Issuer since December 31, 2017.

Notes:
1) Our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for our Senior Term Facilities and our Revolving Credit Facility. The
“adjusted” column reflects term loan borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities that we expect will be drawn on or around
the Completion Date, including borrowings under: (i) a euro tranche in aggregate principal amount of €2,000 million; (ii) a
U.S. dollar tranche in aggregate principal amount of $875 million; (iii) a Polish złoty tranche in aggregate principal amount of
€475 million (equivalent); and (iv) a pound sterling tranche in aggregate principal amount of £445 million plus €300 million
(equivalent). Indebtedness in respect of our Senior Term Facilities is presented based on its principal amount rather than the
carrying value it would have on our balance sheet. The euro equivalent presented in the “adjusted” column takes into
account the U.S. dollar and pound sterling forward currency arrangements which we have concluded in order to ensure the
availability of the required amount of euros on the Completion Date, under which we would be able to convert the proceeds
of the U.S. dollar tranche to euros at a rate no worse than $1.2712 per €1.00 and the proceeds of the £445 million portion of
the pound sterling tranche to euros at a rate no worse than £0.9072 per €1.00; foreign currency amounts presented in this
footnote as euro equivalents (namely, the Polish złoty tranche and the €300 million (equivalent) portion of the pound sterling
tranche) are committed in euros as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and will be converted to their final local
currency amounts when drawn. For a description of the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, see “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.”_
On or about the Completion Date, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility temporarily to make a working capital
payment to Unilever. In connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever
(i) receivables associated with sales of FFG’s products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) payables associated with raw
materials received by FFG prior to the Completion Date. We have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing
the average net negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and
finished products conveyed with the business on the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily
our net negative working capital position This negative net working capital position fluctuates over time as volumes and
pricing in FFG’s markets evolve. Accordingly, while the amount of the payment to Unilever cannot be known with precision
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we estimate that the aggregate amount we will pay to Unilever on account of
the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position will be in the range of €350 million to €450 million and that this
amount will be paid on or about the time the Acquisition is consummated. This is subject to change prior to the Completion
Date. Given the expected temporary and one-time nature of the drawing, driven by the mechanics of FFG’s separation from
Unilever, this drawing is not reflected in the “adjusted” column. We expect our net working capital position to return to a net
negative position and largely normalize within 120 days after such payment is made and we expect to repay the Revolving
Credit Facility drawing as our working capital position normalizes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation
_from Unilever—Following the separation, we will experience a temporary increase in our working capital needs” and_
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
_Resources.”_
2) Unilever’s internal reorganization of the portion of its spreads business focused on the developed market regions of Europe
and North America into the BCS entities during the year ended December 31, 2015 involved the transfer at fair value of
spreads-related trade, assets and liabilities amounting to a total of €2,612.1 million. In some countries, BCS entities drew
down loans from Unilever Finance International AG amounting to a total of €1,289.9 million which provided the relevant BCS

entities the cash necessary to pay the selling Unilever group entities the purchase price of the transferred assets in such
countries. These loans will be extinguished upon consummation of the Acquisition.
3) Overdrafts reflect local bank overdraft facilities and exclude trades payables, pension and post-retirement healthcare
liabilities and tax liabilities.
4) As part of the Transactions, KKR will indirectly contribute equity in an amount of €1,974.2 million to the Issuer. See
“Summary Corporate and Financing Structure” and “Principal Shareholders.”

**SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

_The selected historical financial information provided below has been derived from the audited_
_combined carve-out financial statements of FFG for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and_
_2017._

_The combined carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared by combining and carving-out the_
_assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to FFG. Those_
_amounts have been derived from the underlying financial records of the Unilever entities running_
_Spreads activities, which also include allocations and recharges by Unilever of indirect central costs_
_and general corporate expenses. The combined carve-out Financial Statements include a cash flow_
_statement showing movement arising from operating, investing and financing activities that is_
_independent of Unilever’s centralized approach to cash management and financing and disclose the_
_cumulative investment of Unilever in FFG as net parent (deficit) / investment._

_The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to FFG include_
_all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to FFG, together with an allocation_
_of the items that are not. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the_
_purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out Financial Statements that are not directly_
_attributable and/or separately identifiable._

_The Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect FFG’s financial position, results of operations or_
_cash flows had FFG been a separate entity, or the future results of FFG as it will exist upon the_
_completion of the separation from Unilever. See “Presentation of Financials and Other Information.”_

_This summary historical combined carve-out financial data should be read in conjunction with the_
_sections entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Selected Historical Financial Information,”_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the_
_historical combined carve-out financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum._

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon,_
_and should be read in conjunction with, the Financial Statements, and the related notes thereto_
_included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. It covers periods prior to the consummation of the_
_Acquisition; accordingly, the discussion and analysis of historical periods does not reflect the significant_
_impact that the Transactions will have on us._

_This discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that reflect the current view of_
_management and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those_
_anticipated in forward-looking statements for many reasons. For the preparation of the Financial_
_Statements it was necessary to make assumptions and estimates for carve-out adjustments._
_Accordingly, the Financial Statements do not necessarily reflect the financial position and performance_
_that would have been presented if FFG had already existed as an independent company during the_
_periods presented. As a result, the Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of the future_
_developments of the business. See “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion_
_of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking_
_statements contained herein._

**Overview**

FFG is the world’s leading producer of plant-based and other blended spreads, with leading market
positions in both developed and emerging markets and products sold in over 69 countries. A historic
part of Unilever, FFG will, through the Transactions, become a stand-alone leader in its industry, four
times larger than its nearest global-branded competitor, boasting a global portfolio of iconic consumer
brands, with seven of its key brands each generating at least €175 million in turnover in the year ended
December 31, 2017. FFG has 17 manufacturing facilities located throughout the developed and
emerging markets in which it operates, as well as world-class research and development capabilities
that have put it at the forefront of the plant-based spreads industry.

FFG’s principal product line is Plant-Based Spreads, which accounted for 83% of its turnover in the
year ended December 31, 2017. This is complemented by its line of dairy cream alternatives, which
represented 6% of turnover for the same period, Liquids products (including liquid margarine,
vegetable cooking oils and olive oil), which represented 7% of turnover for the same period, and other
products which represented 4% of turnover for the same period.

FFG is a market leader in North America and Western Europe and has a strong presence across
emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia with number one positions in 44
of its 69 markets. In each of these countries, FFG sells its products predominantly to retail outlets,
including to many of the world’s largest retailers and their chains of supermarkets, hypermarkets,
convenience stores and e-commerce platforms, as well as to wholesalers. FFG also supplies the
foodservice channel, including restaurants, hotels, workplace and educational canteens and healthcare
facilities.

In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, FFG had turnover of €3,294.9 million,
€3,031.7 million and €2,904.9 million, respectively, net profit of €453.6 million, €422.5 million and
€565.1 million, respectively, and Normalized EBITDA of €723.0 million, €686.3 million and
€674.0 million, respectively. Pro Forma Normalized EBITDA was €819.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

FFG reported on a preliminary basis that its turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was
€691.2 million (this includes turnover in Portugal of €11.6 million), which is 6.0% or €44.3 million lower
than FFG’s turnover of €735.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This was primarily
driven by foreign exchange effects. Adjusted for constant currency, USG year on year performance
was -0.3% which shows the continuing positive momentum of the business. Developed Markets USG
of -0.7% was partially offset by Emerging Markets USG of +1.3%. Normalized EBITDA was

78


-----

€165.3 million, which was €3.0 million, or 1.8%, lower than FFG’s Normalized EBITDA of €168.3
million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Savings in Branding and Marketing Investment and
other overhead costs contributed to increase FFG’s Normalized EBITDA Margin for the three months
ended March 31, 2018 by 102 basis points to 23.9% from 22.9% for the three months ended March 31,
2017.

This information is based solely on preliminary internal information used by management and is based
on assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties. Our actual consolidated financial results for
the three months ended March 31, 2018 may differ from our preliminary calculated results and remain
subject to our normal review process, including the adjustments required to present this accounting
information in accordance with IFRS. Those procedures have not been completed. Accordingly, these
results may change and those changes may be material. We caution that the foregoing information has
not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors and should not be regarded as an indication,
forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding our financial performance for the three
months ended March 31, 2018.

**Factors Affecting Comparability**

**_Historical and New Cost Structures_**

FFG historically operated as part of Unilever, which provided substantial infrastructure, management
and shared services to the business. We have no history operating as a stand-alone company.
Consequently, our future results of operations will exclude costs historically allocated to FFG from
Unilever and will include costs and expenses for us to operate as a stand-alone business, and we
expect these costs and expenses to be materially different than FFG’s historical cost structure. We will
also incur a significant amount of debt in connection with the Transactions. Accordingly, the historical
combined financial statements presented in this Offering Memorandum are not indicative of our future
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The historical combined financial statements presented in this Offering Memorandum include
allocations of certain Unilever corporate expenses to the FFG business, including: information
technology resources and support; financing, accounting and auditing services; real estate and
facilities management services; human resources activities; procurement support; treasury services;
distribution and supply chain support; branding and marketing support; legal advisory services; and
research and development services. These expenses were allocated to the FFG business using
various estimates of the utilization of such services or the benefits received by FFG. Such allocations
have been made on the basis of direct usage when identifiable or as a proportion of revenue, adjusted
on a line-by-line basis to reflect specific local circumstances when not. These allocated costs are not
necessarily representative of the future level of costs in our business as it will exist after the
consummation of the Acquisition.

As a stand-alone business, we expect to receive services previously provided by Unilever from our
internal operations or third-party service providers. However, under our TSAs, we will pay Unilever for
certain services for up to 18 months after the consummation of the Acquisition as we transition to
stand-alone operations (with an additional 6 month extension option for IT services and shared
services). We do not believe that the expenses allocated to us for services historically are at a level we
expect to incur after our separation, and the pricing under our TSAs reflects our expected postseparation cost levels. Based on our estimates of the costs we expect to incur as a stand-alone entity,
we expect our stand-alone costs to be different across a number of areas. We expect costs to be lower
across areas including supply chain, branding and marketing investment, and SG&A overheads, while
we expect costs associated with the use of third-party distributors to be higher. Specifically, we expect
stand-alone supply chain costs to be approximately €37 million lower and our branding and marketing
investment to be approximately €17 million lower than the costs allocated to FFG by Unilever in the
year ended December 31, 2017, while we expect costs associated with the use of third-party
distributors to be approximately €26 million higher. Furthermore, with respect to the SG&A overheads
allocated to FFG by Unilever in the year ended December 31, 2017, we believe that net cost savings
based on the stand-alone operating model developed during separation planning with Unilever will
amount to approximately €79 million, and that it is useful, when reviewing our historical and pro forma
financial information, to:

    - remove €293 million of net allocated costs for SG&A overheads provided by Unilever in the
year ended December 31, 2017; and

79


-----

    - add approximately €215 million of estimated annual stand-alone costs for SG&A overheads,
which is what we estimate out stand-alone costs would have been during that period to
provide replacement corporate services, had we fully transitioned to a stand-alone cost
structure base on our own (or third party contractor) service provision, or, to the extent we
utilized services provided by Unilever, we paid for them at rates agreed in the TSAs (which
reflect these expected reductions in SG&A overheads).

The approximately €215 million of estimated annual stand-alone SG&A overhead expenses consist of
the following estimated amounts:

 - €59.3 million in customer development costs related to sales personnel to manage customer
relationships, sales agency fees in markets where certain customer relationship functions are or
will be outsourced, and sales support costs, such as car lease expenses.

 - €30.0 million in marketing support costs related to the global and local coordination of
communications, advertising, brand strategy, lobbying, marketing personnel and marketing
research.

 - €30.2 million in research and development costs related to the development of manufacturing
techniques, the formulation of new products which can be produced with existing manufacturing
techniques, packaging development, adapting and testing products in local market sites before
release, and the monitoring and implementation of food standards and safety guidelines.

 - €26.9 million in finance department costs related to functions such as financial reporting and
budgeting, performance monitoring, tax strategy and compliance, risk management, insurance,
contract management, supply chain finance management, treasury services, cash management
and working capital management.

 - €23.7 million in IT costs related all the main business processes (apart from supply chain IT costs,
which are accounted for in supply chain costs). FFG’s current IT environment is fully shared with
Unilever, which will only be available for a limited time after the completion of the Acquisition
pursuant to a TSA. FFG has developed plans to transition to a fully independent IT environment as
a stand-alone business; however, these plans are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—As FFG builds its
_information technology infrastructure and transitions its data to its own systems, it may incur_
_substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions.”_

 - €9.2 million in HR costs related to central and local support of payroll and benefits systems,
provision of training, HR personnel, as well as other traditional HR functions.

 - €8.3 million for workplace services related to property management, facilities management and
travel services, as well as rent, utility and other operating costs for office space.

 - €13.7 million across general management, legal and other corporate and local costs.

 - €13.3 million incentive costs for key management and directors.

FFG has engaged several consultants and industry experts to assist it in the analysis of its anticipated
stand-alone cost structure. Our estimate of these stand-alone costs is based on several assumptions
that we believe are reasonable but may prove to be inaccurate.

Beyond the stand-alone cost differences in the areas of supply chain, branding and marketing
investment, SG&A overheads and the use of third-party distributors described above, management
also believes that an additional cost savings and efficiencies in respect of SG&A overheads are
achievable promptly upon separation from Unilever, which additional savings are likely to be partly
offset by certain increases in stand-alone costs not fully captured in the stand-alone SG&A overhead
cost base described above. These additional savings and expenses are not reflected in the standalone operating model developed in cooperation with Unilever and not reflected in the cost structure of
the TSAs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—The benefits of the
_separation may not materialize and FFG may not be successful in implementing its growth strategy”._

**Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

FFG’s operating results are affected by a combination of economic, regulatory, industry-specific and
company-specific factors. The following is a description of the key factors affecting the results of FFG’s
operations in prior periods and which are expected to affect its results going forward.

80


-----

**_Changes in Policy Upon Separation from Unilever_**

Historically, FFG has operated as part of Unilever. In certain respects, Unilever group-wide policies
have limited FFG’s ability to implement a growth strategy in a number of respects.

Unilever’s financial policy prioritized gross margin preservation, which discouraged the FFG business
from pursuing relatively lower margin opportunities in the private label, hard discount retailer and
foodservice market segments, which would have provided cash generative sales opportunities that
would have increased asset utilization and helped defray fixed overheads. This focus has also resulted
in reductions in product fat levels to optimize production costs, often to the detriment of taste and
consumer preference, to ensure a stable gross margin.

Unilever’s positioning of its product portfolio also had a constraining effect on FFG’s businesses. FFG’s
principal products played an important role in Unilever’s wider nutritional agenda to reduce levels of fat
(particularly saturated fat) and salt, and as a result, taste and functionality of the spreads products
were deprioritized. Now, as a stand-alone business, FFG is working to reframe the health and
“naturalness” perception around Plant-Based Spreads, particularly in developed markets, while
improving taste and functionality. FFG is reinvesting in taste to improve its existing product offerings
and develop new ones, in particular, FFG plans to build on the “free-from” diet and health trend by
extending its strongest brands into the dairy-free milk and yogurt alternatives. Further expansion into
alternative and sweet spread adjacencies (including chocolate spreads), as well as plant-based dips, to
appeal to higher income and health-conscious millennial demographics, also forms a central part of
strategy and is supported by underlying consumer consciousness of the benefits of a plant-based diet.
Moreover, the historic lack of a sales force dedicated to the spreads business has also meant that
FFG’s product category has been deprioritized as it formed a less important part of the broader
Unilever sales team portfolio. FFG initiatives did not receive priority, given opportunities in more
attractive categories. There was also limited need for Unilever to extend FFG’s brands into adjacent
categories as Unilever is already diversified across categories.

Management believes that, historically, the speed of product development for the FFG business has
been sub-optimal, driven by extensive pre-launch testing and a focus on technical developments,
which hampered new product development to improve brand positioning. This constraint has been
lifted within FFG more recently, with increased levels and speed of lower cost product innovation now
taking place.

The separation from Unilever will also affect FFG’s operating model and expected overhead costs,
especially when compared to costs historically allocated to the business by Unilever. See “—Historical
_and New Cost Structures,” above._

**_Commodity Prices_**

The principal ingredient in FFG’s margarines and other spreads is vegetable oil, specifically liquid and
tropical oils such as rapeseed, soybean, palm and sunflower oils. In the year ended December 31,
2017, raw materials accounted for 44.6% of FFG’s cost of goods sold and 34.6% of total costs. FFG
has a sophisticated procurement function that manages the supply of these materials to FFG’s
manufacturing operations. While FFG leverages its scale in order to secure attractive pricing and
payment terms for its key commodities, it is not immune to fluctuations in price.

In particular, its commodity purchasing arrangements expose FFG to transactional foreign exchange
risk. Transactional foreign exchange risk arises principally as FFG’s operations in each country sell
their products in local currency, but a significant proportion of FFG’s raw materials are purchased in
U.S. dollars. Historically, transactional currency risk was managed through physical and contractual
hedging coordinated by the Unilever central treasury function, tied to the number of weeks it takes for
the business to pass on any cost increases to customers in each territory.

Due to raw material stocks and hedging arrangements, a change in the cost of FFG’s raw materials
takes between three and six months to flow through to the pricing offered on FFG’s products. The
market prices of FFG’s principal raw materials have fluctuated significantly during the course of 2016
and 2017. Most notably, during the second half of 2016, key raw material prices increased
considerably due to heightened demand, the impact of weather patterns (El Niño, in particular) and

81


-----

inventory levels across the industry. During the period, prices of palm oil, rapeseed oil and soybean oil
increased by 26%, 25% and 19%, respectively. In response to these increases, FFG has passed on
price increases to retailers in its emerging markets, but in more recent periods, FFG has chosen not to
pass on price increases in certain of its developed markets, including the U.K. and Germany, as a
strategic move to avoid diminishing the positive momentum from recent innovation and brand
re-launches. The decision in the U.K. was also driven by the adverse response of many of FFG’s
principal customers to Unilever’s approach to pricing in response to the devaluation of sterling following
the Brexit referendum. Price stability in Germany was kept consistent in order to maintain
competitiveness and market share. Certain of FFG’s other developed markets, including the
Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and the Czech Republic increased prices in 2017 to help offset the cost
increases. FFG will remain exposed to fluctuations in the prices of its key raw materials and its ability
to mitigate the impact of those fluctuations through the pricing of its products will need to be balanced
against competitive dynamics in its various markets.

**_Changes in Food Trends and Consumer Preferences_**

The B&M industry has experienced sustained negative trends and is subject to changing consumer
trends, demands and preferences. Retail B&M sales volumes have declined consistently in recent
years and are expected to continue declining, driven by reduced occasions for using spreads
(principally due to reductions in the consumption of leavened bread) and shifts towards the
consumption of food prepared outside the home, which drives B&M sales volumes into the industrial
and foodservice channels where FFG is less well established. Moreover, butter’s relative share of the
overall B&M market has grown in recent years at the expense of the Plant-Based Spreads that FFG
produces, due in part to the perception of enhanced naturalness and health of butter products,
consumer taste preferences and reduced butter prices in certain markets. Historically, FFG’s financial
performance has been adversely impacted by relatively wide market contractions driven by changing
consumer preferences in developed markets (such as the switch to spreadable butter and the decline
in consumption of leavened bread) and lower butter prices, which have resulted in consumers shifting
away from FFG’s core products and resulting in lower sales volumes. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to FFG’s Business and Industry—Established negative trends in the B&M market and changes_
_in consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on FFG’s turnover, results of operations_
_and financial condition.”_

In addition to affecting FFG’s turnover, lower sales volumes also reduce the rate of cost absorption,
meaning that in periods where key input costs are higher, margins are adversely impacted to a greater
degree than would otherwise be the case. However, during the periods under review, FFG’s supply
chain function has been able to mitigate the impact on margins and maintain controllable costs at
stable levels through the implementation of savings programs. Management estimates that
approximately 80% of FFG’s cost base is variable, allowing for a sustainable gross margin going
forward. FFG has consistently operated with a clear approach to fluctuations in commodity and
packaging costs in regards to procurement and foreign exchange hedging policies and, as a result, has
been able to maintain strong levels of profitability after direct costs in changing cost environments.
Moreover, FFG’s ability to effectively leverage its product development expertise to continually update
its portfolio in response to changing consumer tastes—especially with the development of innovative
premium products—is a key element of its strategy.

**_Customer Pricing_**

“Customer pricing” refer to prices that FFG charges to retailers. FFG does not set the prices that
retailers charge to end-use consumers in most developed and some emerging markets.

The prices paid by its customers for FFG’s products are a key driver of its financial results and are
affected by a number of external factors. The consumer prices of FFG’s spreads products are
influenced heavily by a substitution effect with the market price of butter. Butter price decline between
2014 and 2016 impacted the ability of spreads producers to increase price, and contributed to FFG
volume declines. However, the year ended December 31, 2017 saw increases in butter prices which
had a positive effect on the relative prices of FFG’s products, and contributed to the slowdown in FFG
volume declines in 2017, as compared to 2015 and 2016.

Pricing is also driven by the terms FFG agrees with its major retail customers. FFG usually conducts
annual negotiations with most of its large retail customers in developed markets in respect of the

82


-----

supply and pricing of its products in the first quarter of the year. These agreements, often referred to as
Joint Business Plans, usually encompass pricing, trade terms, support for new innovation, assortment,
distribution and shelf space. In some markets, the agreements also include promotional activity for the
year, although in most markets it is still possible to change promotional activity and pricing during the
year. In early 2017, these negotiations were unusually prolonged in a number of countries. The impact
of these prolonged negotiations dissipated in the second half of 2017 (albeit with some lasting impact
on full year financial performance), there can be no assurance that similar issues will not arise in future
years given the competitive dynamics of FFG’s industry. For the avoidance of doubt, in territories
where resale price maintenance is not permitted, retailers remain free at all times to set levels of retail
pricing.

Finally, as a stand-alone business, there is some risk that FFG will sustain a loss of pricing power
relative to its customers, as its stand-alone product offering will be narrower than Unilever’s
pre-separation offering. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—
_Following the separation, we may experience increased costs and decreased pricing power resulting_
_from a decrease in our purchasing and selling power relative to the purchasing power possessed by_
_FFG when it was owned by Unilever.” However, management believes that FFG’s leading position in_
its product categories and its strong iconic brands mitigate these risks.

**_Seasonality_**

FFG experiences some limited seasonality in turnover and profit before overheads. The extent and
impact of such seasonal variations varies among the countries in which FFG operates. For example,
the U.S. business typically experiences two “peaks” in sales during the year: a spike in the fourth
quarter which is driven by Christmas and Thanksgiving, and an increase in sales due to Easter, either
in the first or second quarter depending on the timing of Easter. Similarly, in Indonesia there is a peak
in margarine use for baking during the Ramadan festival season, which can occur in various quarters
from year to year. Furthermore, across all the countries in which we operate, the timing of product
promotions drives volatility from normal consumption. Finally, weather has some limited impact on
sales, especially in markets where FFG products are extensively used for cooking such as the
Netherlands, because hot weather reduces consumer appetite for cooking.

**Explanation of Certain Income Statement Items**

**_Turnover_**

Turnover comprises sales of goods after the deduction of discounts, sales taxes and returns. It does
not include sales between group companies. Discounts given by the business include rebates, price
reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade communication costs.
Turnover is recognized when the risks and rewards of the underlying products have been substantially
transferred to the customer. Depending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of
dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance. The cost of services that are provided by
customers directly to FFG, such as merchandising, listing new products and in-store advertising, is
reported under trade terms and hence deducted from turnover. Furthermore, any terms given to third
party distributors to carry out activities on behalf of FFG are reported under trade terms and therefore
also deducted from turnover. Finally, license and royalty fees for use of brands by third parties are
reported under turnover.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales includes raw and packaging material costs, all production costs including the depreciation
of fixed assets, logistics and warehousing costs including the depreciation of related fixed assets,
business waste and supply chain indirects. Supply chain indirects includes supply chain personnel that
are not reported under production, logistics or warehousing, such as demand and supply planning
personnel, quality assurance personnel and supply chain leadership. Supply Chain indirects also
includes an allocation of shared services cost (IT, Finance, HR and facilities) for services provided to
the supply chain and this includes an allocation of IT amortization related to software that has been
capitalized on the balance sheet. It has been assumed that one-off costs of setting up the new IT
platform for FFG as a standalone business will not be capitalized and therefore there is no amortization
of these assets in the to-be profit and loss of FFG.

83


-----

**_Selling and Administrative Expenses_**

Selling and administrative expenses include: (1) branding and marketing investment, (2) research and
development costs, (3) other indirect central costs and (4) general corporate expenses.

    - Branding and marketing investment comprises three principal areas: (a) advertising expenses
(including media spend on traditional and digital media spots, as well as agency fees and
production costs for traditional and digital media), (b) promotional expenses (including the
costs of promotion packs and samples, communication material and promotion agency costs)
and (c) point of sale investment (including costs of third-party merchandisers and point of sale
materials).

    - Research and development costs primarily relate to FFG’s maintenance and expansion of its
research and development facilities as well as relevant salary and materials expenses.
Research and development spend is fully expensed.

    - Indirect costs primarily relate to FFG’s sales force, merchandising activities, general
management, marketing teams and general marketing indirects.

    - General corporate and local market expenses primarily relate to the finance, legal, IT, HR,
communications and audit functions.

During the periods presented, other indirect central costs and general corporate expenses incurred by
Unilever were systematically recharged to FFG business units as management charges in accordance
with Unilever’s historical internal methodology. These management charges are recharged by Unilever
on the basis of direct usage when identifiable or are based on a proportion of revenue, adjusted on a
line-by-line basis to reflect specific local circumstances, when not. These recharged costs and
expenses:

    - are deemed to have been settled by FFG to Unilever in the period in which these costs were
accrued; and

    - are influenced by the management and recharge arrangements that existed within the
Unilever group and are not necessarily representative of the future level of costs for FFG as it
will exist upon completion of the separation from Unilever.

FFG historically operated as part of Unilever, which provided substantial infrastructure, management
and shared services to the business, including with respect to the items described above. We have no
history operating as a stand-alone company. Consequently, our future results of operations will exclude
costs historically allocated to FFG from Unilever and will include costs and expenses for us to operate
as a stand-alone business, and we expect these costs and expenses to be materially different than
FFG’s historical cost structure. Furthermore, when discussing expected stand-alone SG&A overhead
costs, management separates branding and marketing investment into a separate area of discussion.
See “—Factors Affecting Comparability—Historical and New Cost Structure.”

**_Operating Profit_**

Operating profit is calculated by subtracting Cost of sales and Selling and administrative expenses
from turnover.

**_Net Finance Costs_**

Net finance costs comprise finance costs – interest on related party loans with Unilever and finance
costs related to pensions and similar obligations. Borrowing costs are recognized based on the
effective interest method. The primary component of finance costs in the periods under review was
interest on related party loans from Unilever. We expect that our incurrence of substantial third-party
debt in connection with the Transactions will materially increase our net finance costs in future periods.

**_Taxation_**

Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in
the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in net parent
(deficit) / investment.

84


-----

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

FFG’s business is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax legislation of
these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management and the
government authorities. These matters of judgment give rise to the need to create provisions for tax
payments that may arise in future years. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take
into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments,
recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice.

For the historical periods presented, the tax charge is a combination of the tax charges recorded in the
legal entities comprising FFG’s business and an allocation of the tax charges recorded in Unilever that
are associated with FFG’s business operations not recorded within the legal entities comprising FFG’s
business. The allocation of tax charges recorded within Unilever to FFG has been made using an
effective tax rate that management believes is appropriate to the circumstances of each country.
Accordingly, the tax charges recorded in the Financial Statements may not be representative of the
charges that may arise in the future when the business is operated and taxed on a stand-alone basis.

**_Explanation of Certain Balance Sheet Items_**
The following estimates, judgments and assumptions have been made for the purposes of allocating
items to the combined carve-out Financial Statements that are not directly attributable or separately
identifiable with FFG’s business.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**
Property, plant and equipment includes:

    - land and buildings related to factories and sites shared between Unilever’s spreads business
and other parts of Unilever only where those land and buildings (or share of those land and
buildings) are transferring to the Issuer as part of the Acquisition;

    - plant and machinery at the above sites where directly attributable to spreads or, where
shared, in proportion to its estimated use by the spreads business based on production cost
ratios; and

    - plant and machinery at other sites that are not transferring to the Issuer where directly
attributable to the spreads business.

The property, plant and equipment that will actually be transferred as part of the separation from
Unilever is expected to differ from the property, plant and equipment reflected on FFG’s historical
financial statements, possibly to a material extent.

**_Trade and other receivables_**
FFG has not had separate trade receivables from Unilever in any market, and therefore an allocation of
Unilever trade receivables has been necessary. Where trade receivables held by Unilever relate to
spreads and non-spreads products, FFG trade receivables have been estimated in each of the top
19 countries for the top 20 customers of FFG products by applying the ratio of spreads sales over total
sales to total receivables for each of those customers. The balance for the remaining customers and
countries has been estimated by applying the same ratio after excluding sales from those top
20 customers.

Also includes certain receivables from other parts of Unilever that are not supported by loan
agreements and therefore not presented as financial assets / liabilities.

As set forth below under the caption “—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” trade receivables on FFG’s
balance sheet will in general not transfer with the business as part of the separation from Unilever.
Instead, we will make a payment to Unilever in respect of the net negative working capital position on
or around the Completion Date.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**
As Unilever uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing its operations,
transactions between Unilever and FFG are accounted for through net parent (deficit) / investment.
Accordingly, none of the cash, cash equivalents, debt or related interest income and expense at the
corporate level have been assigned to FFG, with the exception of cash, debt and related interest held
by BCS legal entities.

85


-----

**_Financial Liabilities_**

Intercompany receivables from, and payables to, other parts of Unilever that are supported by loan
agreements have been presented as financial assets / liabilities; other balances have been presented
as part of trade receivables / payables.

Commodity and foreign exchange derivatives are held by Unilever and have been estimated as
follows:

    - Commodity derivatives: in proportion to the commodities used by FFG.

    - Foreign exchange derivatives: using the proportion of FFG usage compared to total Unilever
cost usage.

**_Trade payables and other current liabilities_**

Where trade payables held by Unilever relate to spreads and non-spreads purchases, FFG trade
payables have been estimated using the proportion of the FFG cost of sales and administrative
expenses compared to total Unilever cost of sales and administrative expenses in each country.

Trade payables and current liabilities also includes certain payables to other parts of Unilever that are
not supported by loan agreements and therefore not presented as financial assets / liabilities.

As set forth below under the caption “—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” trade payables on FFG’s
balance sheet will in general not transfer with the business as part of the separation from Unilever.
Instead, we will make a payment to Unilever in respect of the net negative working capital position on
or around the Completion Date.

**_Current tax liabilities_**

Current tax balances in BCS legal entities form part of FFG’s current liabilities. Tax amounts allocated
from Unilever to FFG activities operated outside of BCS legal entities have been reflected in the
combined balance sheet as changes in net parent (deficit) / investment. These liabilities will not
transfer to FFG upon completion of the Acquisition.

**_Turnover_**

Turnover decreased by €126.8 million, or -4.2%, from €3,031.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2016 to €2,904.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusting for constant currency, the
underlying sales growth or USG was -2.7%. Negative sales growth was driven by volume pressure in
Developed Markets, partially offset by growth within Emerging Markets.

_Developed markets_

Developed Markets turnover decreased by €127.1 million, or -5.2% from €2,429.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016 to €2,302.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. On a constant
currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales
growth or USG was -4.2%. This was mainly driven by declines in both North America and Europe.

In North America turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by €44.8 million, or -6.7%, to
€619.4 million from €664.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and
by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -4.2%.
This was driven by overall B&M market contraction, changing consumer behavior (including a decrease in
bread consumption and further shifts to out of the home dining), a shift to butter or alternative spreads, and
price competition. All of these factors affected the U.S. business but had a larger negative impact on the
FFG business in Canada. Within North America, turnover in the U.S. in the year ended December 31, 2017
declined by €35.5 million, or -6.3%, to €531.1 million from €566.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2016.

In Europe, turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 continued to decline by €83.9 million, or -4.9%,
to €1,628.0 million from €1,711.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency
basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG
was -3.8%. Within Europe, turnover in Germany in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by
€6.7 million, or -2.0%, to €324.8 million from €331.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.
Turnover in the Netherlands in the year ended December 31, 2017 declined by €5.1 million, or -2.5%, to
€197.6 million from €202.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Turnover in the UK in the year
ended December 31, 2017 declined by €40.8 million, or -14.5%, to €240.7 million from €281.5 million in the
year ended December 31, 2016. Turnover was adversely impacted in early 2017 due to unusually
prolonged negotiations with customers, which was partially offset by price increases realized in the second
quarter, supported by brand relaunches and the recovery of butter prices from historic lows beginning in the
second quarter of the year. Czech Republic USG was back in growth with USG of +7.8% and there was a
slow-down in the rate of decline in Germany and Netherlands with USG of -2.0% and -2.5% respectively.
The U.K., however, remained a very challenging market, with a USG of -8.2%. In connection with the
Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint venture entity (Unilever
Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG and will fully consolidate its results with
FFG’s. The business in Portugal had €48.6 million in turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 and
€50.4 million in turnover in the year ended December 31, 2016.

_Emerging Markets_

Turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017 was relatively flat in Emerging Markets, growing by
€0.3 million, or +0.1%, to €602.9 million from €602.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On
a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying
sales growth or USG was +3.3%. Within Emerging Markets, turnover in Indonesia in the year ended
December 31, 2017 increased by €1.8 million, or 2.2%, to €82.3 million from €80.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016. Turnover in Mexico in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by
€11.0 million, or 12.1%, to €102.0 million from €91.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.
Margarine has been growing significantly in key Emerging Market geographies, primarily driven by
volume growth, as the region benefits from favorable macroeconomic drivers (including strong
population growth, a rising middle class and growing demand for B&M products). USG in Latin America
was +2.6% driven mainly by Mexico USG of +15.6% due to several price increases and also some
volume growth. This growth was offset partially by declines in Brazil, where USG was -10.3%, mainly
due to macroeconomic challenges. Turnover in Asia was positively affected by a recovery in sales in
Sri Lanka following the resumption of production after a fire at FFG’s production facility in that country
in 2016, mitigating lower than expected performance in Indonesia. In Africa and the Middle East,
turnover growth remains strong due to positive macroeconomic trends in Africa as well as positive
pricing conditions in Turkey and Kenya.

_Retail and Foodservice_

Global turnover through FFG’s retail channel decreased by €133.2 million, or -4.8%, from
€2,775.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €2,641.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or
disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -3.4%. This decline was primarily driven by
adverse market dynamics in the European and North American markets, partly offset by improving
market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets. Global turnover through FFG’s foodservice channel
increased by €6.5 million, or +2.5%, from €256.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to
€263.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating
the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was +4.4% driven by
price and growth in overall food services market globally.

_Product Categories_

FFG’s global turnover in the Plant-Based Spreads product category decreased by €93.9 million, or
-3.8%, from €2,492.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €2,398.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2017. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any
acquisitions or disposals, USG in the Plant-Based Spreads category was -2.3%. This decline was
primarily driven by adverse market dynamics in the European and North American markets, partly
offset by improving market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets. FFG’s global turnover in other
product categories decreased by €29.7 million, or -5.7%, from €516.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016 to €486.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 with creams growing
turnover by 1.4% while all other markets were in decline. Adjusting for constant currency, USG in other
product categories was -4.4%.

_Quarterly Evolution_

FFG’s global turnover was 5.5% lower in the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2016, 3.2% lower in the three months ended June 30, 2017 when
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, 4.2% lower in the three months ended
September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 3.9% lower
in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended
December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or
disposals, USG saw a decrease of 5.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of 3.1% in the three months ended June 30, 2017
when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of 1.8% in the three months
ended September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a
decrease of 0.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months
ended December 31, 2016. In Developed Markets, adjusting for constant currency and by eliminating
the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, USG saw a decrease of 8.8% in the three months ended
March 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of 5.1% in the
three months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, a
decrease of 2.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and a decrease of 0.8% in the three months ended December 31, 2017
when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. In Emerging Markets, adjusting for
constant currency and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, USG saw a growth of
7.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended March 31,
2016, a growth of 4.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the three months
ended June 30, 2016, a growth of 0.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2017 when
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a growth of 1.1% in the three months
ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The
improved trend in recent quarters globally has mainly been driven by volume growth in Europe, notably
in the U.K. and Germany, which is due to internal factors (including the ongoing implementation of
FFG’s new strategies and initiatives, the re-launch or repositioning of certain major brands, such as
Rama, Becel and Country Crock, and the launch of innovative new products centered around around
“free-from,” organic and plant oil products with strong wellness, taste and plant-based nutrition
perceptions) and external factors (namely, increasing butter prices which make margarine a more
attractive substitute product).

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales was €1,823.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, an €14.3 million, or 0.8%
increase from €1,837.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This was primarily driven by a
spike in commodity prices in the first half of 2017, particularly those of palm, rapeseed, soybean and
linseed oils, partially offset by procurement and packaging cost savings initiatives. In North America,
certain supply chain disruptions and start-up costs associated with the consolidation of production in
the New Century, Kansas, facility in 2016 did not reoccur in 2017, and continued improvement in
soybean oil costs and waste and logistics costs in North America has improved performance. In
connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint
venture entity (Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG and will fully
consolidate its results with FFG’s. The business in Portugal had €30.7 million in cost of sales in the
year ended December 31, 2017 and €32.7 million in cost of sales in the year ended December 31,
2016.

**_Selling and administrative expenses_**

Selling and administrative expenses were €526.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, a
€97.3 million, or -15.6% decrease from €623.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The
decrease was driven by a decrease in BMI costs from €269.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2016 to €211.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, due to a shift away from television to
digital and point-of-sale advertising, a focus on key brands, a reduction of external agency spending
and improved planning. The decrease was also driven by a reduction in overheads attributed to the
establishment of the BCS entities in Europe and reduced allocations of central costs on account of
lower turnover. In connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically
operated through a joint venture entity (Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly
owned by FFG and will fully consolidate its results with FFG’s. The business in Portugal had
€3.1 million in BMI costs in the year ended December 31, 2017 and €3.4 million in BMI costs in the
year ended December 31, 2016.

Historical selling and administrative expenses may not be indicative of future results going forward due
to the replacement of allocated overhead services provided by Unilever with stand-alone overhead
services that will be provided internally after the consummation of the Acquisition. See “—Explanation
_of Certain Income Statement Items—Selling and administrative expenses” and “—Factors Affecting_
_Comparability—Historical and New Cost Structures.”_

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit was €555.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, a €15.2 million, or 2.7%
decrease from €570.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Declining volumes exacerbated
the impact of increased commodity prices, and adverse foreign exchange effects offset by price
increases in particular in Emerging Markets and some of the positive fundamental trends in Emerging
Markets. FFG was able to pass along the effect of higher commodity prices to its customers in some of
its markets but not all of them, leading to margin squeeze in certain markets. Pricing pressure due to
the continued low consumer price of butter, particularly in North America, also adversely impacted
operating profit. This was partially offset by further rationalization of BMI spend with higher focus on
key brands and improved planning, and margins are expected to improve as a result of the cost
savings initiatives which have already been implemented as well as those which have been planned. In
connection with the Acquisition, FFG’s business in Portugal, which historically operated through a joint
venture entity (Unilever Jerónimo Martins, Limitada), will become wholly owned by FFG and will fully
consolidate its results with FFG’s. The business in Portugal had €9.1 million in operating profit in the
year ended December 31, 2017 and €8.1 million in operating profit in the year ended December 31,
2016.

**_Net finance costs_**

Net finance costs were €8.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, a €0.1 million, or 1.2%
increase from €8.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.

Net finance costs in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 are primarily associated with
related party loans from Unilever which were extended in connection the internal reorganization of

89


-----

aspects of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities which took place in late
2015, which are expected to be extinguished in connection with the separation from Unilever.
Accordingly, net finance costs recorded in the Financial Statements are not expected to be
representative of the net finance costs that will arise in the future after the Transactions are
consummated.

**_Taxation_**

Taxation income was €14.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to taxation costs
of €142.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. While underlying corporate tax charges were
largely unchanged from prior years, the 2017 result was primarily driven by an internal transfer of the
European supply chain business from Switzerland to the Netherlands which gave rise to an intangible
tax asset on FFG’s balance sheet, as well as a tax benefit arising from U.S. tax reform enacted on
December 22, 2017.

The allocation of tax charges recorded within Unilever to FFG has been made using an effective tax
rate that management believes is appropriate to the circumstances of each country. Accordingly, the
tax charges recorded in the Financial Statements may not be representative of the charges that may
arise in the future when the business is operated and taxed on a stand-alone basis.

**_Net profit_**

As a result of the foregoing factors, net profit increased by €142.6 million, or 33.8%, from
€422.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €565.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2017.

**Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and the Year Ended December 31, 2015**

**_Turnover_**

Turnover decreased by €263.2 million, or 8.0%, from €3,294.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2015 to €3,031.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by
eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -5.2%.
Negative sales growth was driven by volume pressure in Developed Markets, partially offset by growth
within Emerging Markets.

_Developed Markets_

Developed Markets turnover decreased by €237.7 million, or 8.9% from €2,666.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015 to €2,429.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant
currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales
growth or USG was -7.1%. This was driven largely by declines in both North America and Europe.

Within Developed Markets, turnover in North America declined by €46.4 million, or 6.5%, from
€710.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €664.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the
underlying sales growth or USG was -5.8%. This decline was primarily driven by adverse market
dynamics, including a change in consumer behavior and health perceptions of FFG’s products, as well
as a shift towards butter or alternative spreads, which led to increased pricing pressure.

Turnover in Europe declined by €192.9 million, or 10.1%, from €1,904.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €1,711.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant currency
basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales growth or
USG was -7.6%, primarily driven by a shrinking market, particularly in regions where there is a strong
butter market. The majority of European countries, but particularly the U.K. (USG of -9.8%) and
Germany (USG of -8.3%), have been significantly impacted by growth in spreadable butter. These
impacts have been offset, in part, by increasingly positive health perceptions of FFG’s products and
improvements in historically low butter prices, which have a substitution effect on the pricing of FFG’s
products.

_Emerging Markets_

Turnover in FFG’s emerging markets increased by €25.5 million, or 4.1%, from €628.1 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015 to €602.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. On a constant
currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or disposals, the underlying sales
growth or USG was +3.2%. The easing of recessionary pressures, particularly in Latin America,
supported increases in pricing. Strong market trends in Asia, as well as positive macroeconomic
factors in Africa and favorable pricing dynamics in Turkey also helped to drive the growth.

_Retail and Foodservice_

Global turnover through FFG’s retail channel decreased by €259.8 million, or 8.6%, from
€3,034.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €2,775.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis and by eliminating the impact of any acquisitions or
disposals, the underlying sales growth or USG was -5.8%. This decline was primarily driven by
adverse market dynamics in the European and North American markets, partly offset by improving
market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets. Global turnover through FFG’s foodservice channel
decreased slightly by €3.5 million, or 1.3%, from €260.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015
to €256.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusting for constant currency the underlying
sales growth or USG was +1.5% driven by strong growth in Emerging markets (USG of +7.8%).

_Product Categories_

FFG’s global turnover in the B&M product category decreased by €236.0 million, or 8.6%, from
€2,751.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €2,515.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016. This decline was primarily driven by adverse market dynamics in the European
and North American markets, partly offset by improving market conditions in FFG’s emerging markets
and negative exchange rates. FFG’s global turnover in other product categories decreased by
€27.2 million from €543.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €516.0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016 primarily driven by market decline in developed markets.

_Quarterly Evolution_
FFG’s global turnover was 7.7% lower in the three months ended March 31, 2016 when compared to
the three months ended March 31, 2015, 9.7% lower in the three months ended June 30, 2016 when
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, 8.6% lower in the three months ended
September 30, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 6.1% lower
in the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended
December 31, 2016.

**_Cost of sales_**
Cost of sales was €1,837.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a €134.6 million, or 6.8%,
decrease from €1,971.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. While the decrease was
primarily driven by the reduction in volumes of product produced and sold, it was further decreased
beyond the rate of underlying volume declines by the completion of a significant rationalization
program at FFG’s North American production facilities which eliminated supply chain inefficiencies that
affected results in the year ended December 31, 2015.

**_Selling and administrative expenses_**
Selling and administrative expenses were €623.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a
€154.6 million, 19.9%, decrease from €778.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The
decrease was driven by cost saving initiatives and a decrease in expense allocations from Unilever
following the formation of BCS, and to a lesser extent by a reduction in BMI spend from €314.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €269.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015
following the reduction of global marketing charges in the year ended December 31, 2016. The internal
reorganization of aspects of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities which took
place in mid-2015 led to greater autonomy and efficiency in overhead costs, and reductions in centrally
allocated services from Unilever. Most savings from the reorganization were realized in 2016.
Research and development costs remained stable during this period, increasing slightly from
€51.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €52.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2016.

Historical selling and administrative expenses may not be indicative of future results going forward due
to the replacement of allocated overhead services provided by Unilever with stand-alone overhead
services that will be provided internally after the consummation of the Acquisition. See “—Explanation
_of Certain Income Statement Items—Selling and administrative expenses” and “—Factors Affecting_
_Comparability—Historical and New Cost Structures.”_

**_Operating profit_**
Operating profit increased by €26.0 million, or 4.8%, from €544.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2015 to €570.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. Despite the decline in
sales, operating profit was positively impacted by decreases in both cost of sales and selling and
administrative expenses as discussed above. FFG’s Developed Markets operations saw a decrease in
volumes as well as increases in commodity prices, which were only partially offset by a decrease in
BMI spend. There was also increased price pressure from retailers resulting from competition for shelf
space. In Emerging Markets, declines in volumes and increased supply chain costs in the region were
more than offset by price increases.

**_Net finance costs_**
Net finance costs increased by €5.3 million from €3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 to
€8.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in balances on related
party loans from Unilever which were extended in connection with the internal reorganization of
aspects of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities which took place in late
2015, leading to higher full year interest costs in 2016.

**_Taxation_**
Taxation increased by €51.8 million, or 56.9%, from €91.0 million in the year ended December 31,
2015 to €142.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. While underlying corporate tax charges
were largely unchanged, the 2015 tax figure was primarily driven by the creation of deferred tax assets
on FFG’s balance sheet arising from changes in the underlying tax bases of intellectual property and
other intangible assets transferred at fair value during the restructuring of a portion of Unilever’s
spreads business into the BCS entities, which reduced the taxation charge recorded in that year. The
creation of deferred tax assets did not recur in 2016.

92


-----

The allocation of tax charges recorded within Unilever to FFG has been made using an effective tax
rate that management believes is appropriate to the circumstances of each country. Accordingly, the
tax charges recorded in the Financial Statements may not be representative of the charges that may
arise in the future when the business is operated and taxed on a stand-alone basis.

**_Net profit_**

As a result of the foregoing factors, net profit decreased by €31.1 million, or 6.9%, from €453.6 million
in the year ended December 31, 2015 to €422.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.

**Analysis of Certain Consolidated Balance Sheet Items**

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value. Cost comprises
direct costs and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. FFG’s
inventories are comprised of raw materials, consumables and finished goods and goods for resale. In
2015, 2016 and 2017, average inventory days were 26, 26 and 25, respectively, a figure management
plans to reduce by one day as part of the implementation of its business plan to further increase
efficiency and improve its working capital position.

**_Trade and other current receivables_**

FFG’s trade receivables principally comprise payments due from customers for the supply of FFG’s
products. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited as FFG’s customer
base is large and diverse on a global basis, with no customer representing more than 10% of FFG’s
turnover in 2017. Average receivable days in 2015, 2016 and 2017 were 20, 21 and 20, respectively.

FFG’s trade receivables figures are based on allocations from Unilever. Where trade receivables held
by Unilever relate to spreads and non-spreads products, FFG trade receivables have been estimated
in each of the top 19 countries for the top 20 customers of spreads products by applying the ratio of
spreads sales over total sales to total receivables for each of those customers. The remaining balance
has been estimated by applying the same ratio after excluding sales from those top 20 customers.

The following table sets out the aging of FFG’s trade receivables for the periods indicated.

**177.6** **172.5** **159.9**

**_Trade payables and other current liabilities_**

Trade payables comprise amounts due to creditors, principally for the supply of raw materials used in
the manufacture of FFG’s products, as well as packaging and distribution costs. Trade payable days in
2015, 2016 and 2017 were 112, 119 and 114, respectively.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Liquidity describes our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of our
business operations, including working capital needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures,
contractual obligations and other commitments, as well as acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity
are provided by our cash from operating activities, including our net negative working capital position,

93


-----

and our financings. Our principal liquidity requirements arise from the need to settle supplier payables
and fund our ongoing operations. During the periods under review, the liquidity needs of the business
were mainly funded from cash from operations, including our net negative working capital position.

FFG’s business is cash generative and during the periods under review it has operated with negative
net working capital, driven by longer credit terms received on purchases from its suppliers compared to
those offered to its customers. Particularly in its developed markets, trade receivables are net of trade
term rebates and trade payable days are significantly longer than inventory and receivables days.
Historically, FFG has managed its trade payables on typically 90 to 120 day terms and managed its
receivables on typically 30 day terms. FFG also offer additional discounts to customers in many
markets for “prompt payment”, which is defined as payment in less than 30 days. This net negative
working capital balance also exists in FFG’s emerging markets, but to a lesser extent. In the year
ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s payable days to suppliers globally were 114, versus average
inventory days of 25 and receivable days from customers of 20. We are exposed to the risk that after
the separation from Unilever our working capital position and operating cash flows could deteriorate
due to changes in terms with customers or suppliers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s
_Separation from Unilever—Changes to FFG’s payment terms with customers or suppliers may_
_adversely affect its working capital position and operating cash flows.”_

In connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever (i) FFG’s
rights to collect receivables associated with sales of its products prior to the Completion Date and
(ii) its obligations to satisfy the payables associated with raw materials received prior to the Completion
Date. This is because the receivables and payables associated with FFG’s operations pre-separation
are generally incorporated within collective invoices which span products sold or supplies used across
the Unilever group. In addition, we expect FFG’s inventories of raw materials and finished products on
hand on the Completion Date to be conveyed with the business. We have therefore agreed to pay
Unilever an amount representing the average net negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted
for the value of any inventories of raw materials and finished products conveyed with the business on
the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily our net negative working
capital position.

While the foregoing amounts cannot be known with precision as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we estimate that the aggregate amount we will pay to Unilever on account of the the net
value of FFG’s negative working capital position will be in the range of €350 million to €450 million and
we expect that this amount will be paid on or about the Completion Date. We expect to draw on the
Revolving Credit Facility to make this payment. This is subject to change prior to the Completion Date.

While we expect our net working capital position to return to a net negative position and largely
normalize within 120 days after such payment is made, there can be no guarantee that all of these
transactions will occur as and when expect and that our net working capital position will in fact
normalize on that schedule, or at all. Changes to trade terms available to us after the separation
brought about by our reduced scale, as well as fluctuations in the underlying market prices or sales
volumes for our products or the raw materials we consume, could each delay or prevent the expected
normalization of our net working capital position; moreover, technical difficulties in valuing inventories
and reconciling accounts may delay the date of such payment in respect of the net value of FFG’s
negative working capital position.

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
outstanding €4,959.7 million in aggregate indebtedness, with an additional €700 million of borrowing
capacity available under our new Revolving Credit Facility. €350 million to €450 million of this
borrowing capacity is expected to be drawn to make the working capital reimbursement to Unilever
described above, which will be a substantial short-term demand on our liquidity. We expect to repay
this drawing as our working capital position normalizes. Moreover, our substantial indebtedness will
significantly increase our long-term liquidity requirements, primarily due to debt service requirements.

Furthermore, we will require additional liquidity to meet the expenses and capital expenditures that
FFG expects to incur to transition to a stand-alone business. We currently estimate that we will incur
approximately €200 million in transition-related expenses and one time expenditures, including

94


-----

approximately €165 million in transitional IT and manufacturing IT costs which we expect to incur as
FFG transitions from a shared IT environment within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform, and
approximately €15 million in one-off real-estate related costs as new head offices are equipped
globally. The substantial majority of the IT expenses are expected to be incurred through
December 31, 2019.

To meet these additional liquidity needs going forward, we expect our sources of liquidity will consist
mainly of the following:

    - cash generated from our operating activities;

    - borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities;

    - issuances of debt securities; and

    - borrowings under other loan facilities.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings,
will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity needs, working capital requirements, separationrelated expenditures and debt service obligations for the next twelve months, we cannot assure you
that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity
financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due,
including the Notes, or to fund all of our other projected liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

    - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations,
which could be due to downturns in our performance or the industry as a whole;

    - increased commodity costs which we cannot pass onto customers;

    - exposure to increased interest rates in relation to our borrowings which bear interest at a
variable rate, including our Senior Term Facilities and our Revolving Credit Facility;

    - changes in trade terms or market conditions which might imperil our ability to maintain a net
negative working capital position consistent with past practice; and

    - higher capital expenditure, such as due to higher than expected expenses incurred in
connection with our product innovation and growth strategies.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity
needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;

    - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

    - restructure or refinancing all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before
maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis
or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the Notes and the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives, as may the
terms of any future debt.

**_Cash flow_**

As Unilever uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing its operations, transaction
between Unilever and FFG are accounted for through net parent (deficit) / investment. Accordingly,
none of the cash, cash equivalents debt or related interest income and expense at the corporate level
have been assigned to FFG, with the exception of cash, debt and related interest held by BCS legal
entities. The “Other transactions with Unilever and owners of non-controlling interests” line item below
reflects the fact that FFG does not retain cash generated from operating activities and represents the
cash outflow associated with repatriating such cash to Unilever, net of (i) any movement in working
capital, (ii) investing activities and (iii) other financing activities.

_Net cash flow from operating activities_
Net cash from operating activities decreased by €10 million, or 1.8%, from €558.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016 to €548.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The principal
factors contributing to this decrease were a decline in USG, increased commodity prices and a
negative exchange rate impact.

Net cash from operating activities decreased by €35.5 million, or 6.0%, from €593.9 million in the year
ended December 31, 2015 to €558.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 reflecting the
decrease in operating profit during the period.

_Net cash used in investing activities_
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by €20.5 million, or 42.3%, from €48.5 million in the
year ended December 31, 2016 to €28.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease

96


-----

was driven by a significant decrease in the purchase of property, plant and equipment to what we
believe is a more normalized level going forward.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by €30.9 million, or 38.9%, from €79.4 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015 to €48.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease
was driven by lower levels of investment in property, plant and equipment in 2016 compared to 2015
following the completion of the significant consolidation project at FFG’s North American manufacturing
operations.

_Net cash used in financing activities_

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by €12.7 million, or 2.5%, from €514.1 million in the
year ended December 31, 2016 to €501.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease
was mainly due to a decrease in repayments to Unilever of related party loans.

Net cash used in financing activities increased by €17.0 million, or 3.4%, from €497.1 million in the
year ended December 31, 2015 to €514.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase
was mainly due to an increase in repayments to Unilever of related party loans.

**_Changes in working capital_**

FFG benefits from a negative net working capital cycle as its trade payable days (114 in the year
ended December 31, 2017) are significantly longer than its inventory days (25 in the year ended
December 31, 2017) and receivable days (20 in the year ended December 31, 2017). This largely is a
structural feature of the payment terms customarily available in the raw material and finished product
markets in which FFG operates, and while there are some risks to FFG’s ability to maintain its working
capital cycle on precisely these terms going forward (such as those associated with its reduced scale
following the separation from Unilever, and the potential ending of certain supplier financing
arrangements previously sponsored by Unilever), this cycle is not expected to shift fundamentally upon
the separation from Unilever. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from Unilever—
_Changes to FFG’s payment terms with customers or suppliers may adversely affect its working capital_
_position and operating cash flows.” This cycle is also a result of FFG’s operational efficiency with_
respect to its inventory management, in which management believes there is scope for improvement
upon the separation from Unilever.

FFG’s working capital is comprised of inventory, trade payables and trade receivables. Movements in
FFG’s working capital historically have been driven by changes in sales volumes which impact levels of
receivables. These movements are calculated based on Unilever’s allocations of movements in trade
payables and trade receivables to FFG, and these results may be different from those FFG would have
presented had it been a stand-alone business during the periods presented. Over the periods
presented, FFG has maintained relatively stable days outstanding on receivables as well as inventory
days while trade payable days outstanding have increased.

The change in working capital in the year ended December 31, 2016 was an inflow of €12.1 million,
compared to an inflow of €54.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher inflow in
2015 was driven by higher levels of trade payables.

The change in working capital in the year ended December 31, 2017 was an inflow of €28.0 million,
compared to an inflow of €12.1 million in the year ended 31 December 2016. The higher inflow in 2015
was driven by a large fall in receivables (-10%) with only a small fall in payables (-2%).

**Capital Expenditure**

Historically, a significant proportion of FFG’s capital expenditure was attributable to its manufacturing
operations in North America, most recently with respect to the rationalization of those facilities and their
consolidation at the New Century, Kansas, plant, which was completed in the year ended
December 31, 2015 (although the majority of the expenditure for this rationalization occurred in prior
periods). In addition, a new manufacturing plant was opened in Nigeria in 2017. Apart from these two
new plants, capital expenditure has largely been devoted to maintenance. The table below sets out
FFG’s capital expenditure by region for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Apart from the planned capital expenditures included in the €165 million in transitional IT and
manufacturing IT costs that we expect FFG to incur as it transitions from a shared IT environment
within Unilever to a wholly independent IT platform, and the €15 million in one-off real-estate costs
related to setting up new head offices around the world, FFG does not anticipate significant capital
expenditure needs in the short to medium term.

**Financial Liabilities and Contractual Obligations**

**_Contractual Obligations_**

In addition to FFG’s indebtedness, the business has major contractual relationships with its customers
and in respect of its supply chain. FFG enters into “joint business plans” with its major retailer
customers which are year-long contractual frameworks governing the supply of products to such
retailers and the participation in joint promotional and periodic discount activities with such major
retailers. Precise volumes and prices of products supplied are not typically locked into these contracts
in advance. With respect to its supply chain, FFG enters into cash-settled hedging arrangements with
counterparties in the commodity markets to hedge pricing risks. FFG also enters into physical forwards
and spot or near-spot supply contracts with a range of reputable, high-quality suppliers of edible oils
and other essential inputs. FFG has a small number of long-term supply contracts with raw materials
suppliers, typically in situations where a long-term contract helps such supplier mitigate startup risks or
ramp-up / ramp-down costs, thus improving the pricing terms available to us. Finally, FFG is party to
collective bargaining arrangements in respect of certain of its production facilities.

The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings as at December 31, 2017, as adjusted to give effect to
the Transactions, is as follows:

1) Reflects term loan borrowings under the Senior Term Facilities that we expect will be drawn on or around the Completion
Date, including borrowings under: (i) a euro tranche in aggregate principal amount of €2,000 million; (ii) a U.S. dollar tranche
in aggregate principal amount of $875 million; (iii) a Polish złoty tranche in aggregate principal amount of €475 million
(equivalent); and (iv) a pound sterling tranche in aggregate principal amount of £445 million plus €300 million (equivalent).
Indebtedness in respect of our Senior Term Facilities is presented based on its principal amount rather than the carrying
value it would have on our balance sheet. The euro equivalent presented here takes into account the U.S. dollar and pound
sterling forward currency arrangements which we have concluded in order to ensure the availability of the required amount
of euros on the Completion Date, under which we would be able to convert the proceeds of the U.S. dollar tranche to euros
at a rate no worse than $1.2712 per €1.00 and the proceeds of the £445 million portion of the pound sterling tranche to
euros at a rate no worse than £0.9072 per €1.00; foreign currency amounts presented in this footnote as euro equivalents
(namely, the Polish złoty tranche and the €300 million (equivalent) portion of the pound sterling tranche) are committed in
euros as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and will be converted to their final local currency amounts when drawn.
For a description of the terms of the Senior Term Facilities, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior
_Credit Facilities Agreement—Senior Term Facilities.”_
2) On or about the Completion Date, we expect to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility temporarily to make a working capital
payment to Unilever. In connection with the separation from Unilever, we have agreed to leave behind in Unilever
(i) receivables associated with sales of FFG’s products prior to the Completion Date and (ii) payables associated with raw

98


-----

materials received by FFG prior to the Completion Date. We have therefore agreed to pay Unilever an amount representing
the average net negative working capital position of FFG, as adjusted for the value of any inventories of raw materials and
finished products conveyed with the business on the Completion Date. This payment to Unilever will eliminate temporarily
our net negative working capital position. This negative net working capital position fluctuates over time as volumes and
pricing in FFG’s markets evolve. Accordingly, while the amount of the payment to Unilever cannot be known with precision
as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we estimate that the aggregate amount we will pay to Unilever on account of
the net value of FFG’s negative working capital position will be in the range of €350 million to €450 million and that this
amount will be paid on or about the time the Acquisition is consummated. This is subject to change prior to the Completion
Date. Given the expected temporary and one-time nature of the drawing, driven by the mechanics of FFG’s separation from
Unilever, this drawing is not reflected in this table. We expect our net working capital position to return to a net negative
position and largely normalize within 120 days after such payment is made and we expect to repay the Revolving Credit
Facility drawing as our working capital position normalizes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to FFG’s Separation from
_Unilever—Following the separation, we will experience a temporary increase in our working capital needs” and “—Liquidity_
_and Capital Resources.” For a description of the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, see “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Revolving Credit Facility.”_

**_Provisions_**

Restructuring provisions primarily include people costs such as redundancy costs and cost of
compensation where manufacturing, distribution or selling agreements are to be terminated. As at
December 31, 2017, FFG had €5 million provisioned for in relation to restructuring costs. These
restructuring provisions are an allocation of Unilever provisions. The remaining other provisions of
€9 million were a number of items allocated to us from Unilever.

**_Contingent Liabilities_**

Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic
benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will
result in an obligation in the future. Contingent liabilities are disclosed at the risk adjusted best estimate
of the amount that would be required to settle the liability as at the balance sheet date. Where a risk
weighting is not available, the maximum exposure is reported.

In connections with the Transactions, Unilever gave us an indemnity in respect of certain historic
claims, which management expects will mitigate the cost of potential contingent liabilities.

During 2016, one of Unilever’s subsidiaries in Israel became the subject of an application for
certification of a class action claim based on allegations of unfair pricing in the margarine market. The
claim, which has not been certified by the court, would, if so certified, be for approximately €33 million.
Unilever intends to robustly defend this claim and believe that the likelihood that the plaintiff will
ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. Therefore the matter
has not been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Additionally, in March 2018, a
Unilever subsidiary in Greece received a Statement of Objections from the Hellenic Competition
Commission for alleged violations of competition law in the margarine sector from 1996 until today.
Unilever is still assessing the implications from this complex case and is unable to assess the level of
any potential fine. Should the allegations be upheld, the maximum fine which could be levied under
Greek law is 10% of turnover, which would be approximately €40 million. Unilever intends to defend
these allegations robustly, although there is no guarantee of success, and therefore the matter has not
been provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Finally, in 2015 a class action lawsuit
was filed against one of Unilever’s subsidiaries in California based on allegations of deceptive labelling
and marketing of the “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!” brand. The case had been stayed since 2015
pending rulings in another appellate matter, but the stay was lifted in 2017 and class certification
discovery is now ongoing. A decision on class certification is expected in 2019. Unilever intends to
robustly defend this claim and has not reserved any amounts in connection with this litigation.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

The Unilever treasury department has historically provided central deposit taking, funding and foreign
exchange management services for Unilever’s group operations, including FFG. Upon separation from
Unilever, our stand-alone treasury department will assume the majority of these functions, however
hedging services will be provided by Unilever under a TSA until FFG develops the requisite capacity. In
addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of authorities and extensive independent reporting
covers all major areas of activity.

99


-----

These treasury department activities are designed to:

       - protect FFG’s financial results and position from the financial risks discussed below;

       - maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimizing returns; and

       - provide adequate and sufficient funding to FFG.

FFG’s capital requirements have previously been centrally managed by Unilever, who has provided
funding so as to safeguard FFG’s ability to continue as a going concern and to optimize returns to
Unilever. Upon consummation of the Transactions, we will be required to maintain our own capital on a
stand-alone basis. In addition, upon consummation of the Transactions we will be subject to the
financial covenants set forth in the Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that FFG will face in meeting its obligations associated with its financial
liabilities. FFG’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet its
liabilities when due without incurring unacceptable losses.

The financial liabilities of FFG as of December 31, 2017 are mainly loans payable to Unilever and trade
payables which are mostly short term in nature. The financial assets of FFG as of December 31, 2017
are mainly trade receivables from reputable customers which are short term in nature. FFG has
maintained a positive cash balance throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017. This was the result of cash
delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from loans provided by Unilever. Upon
consummation of the Transactions, we expect the loans payable to Unilever to be extinguished;
however, we expect our financial liabilities at that time to comprise principally the Notes, the amounts
drawn under the Senior Term Facilities and the drawing on the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of
the working capital payment to Unilever described above under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to FFG if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual
obligations. FFG’s trade receivables are short term in nature and largely comprise amounts receivable
from reputable customers. These risks are generally managed by local controllers.

Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments has historically been managed on a total Unilever
basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash equivalents,
deposits and derivative financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting
date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. After consummation of the Acquisition, this
will be managed on a stand-alone basis.

**_Market Risk_**

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within
acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.

FFG’s size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise from its use
of financial instruments:

       - Commodity price risk: The key commodities used by FFG are rapeseed oil, soybean oil,
sunflower oil, palm oil, palm stearin and palm kernel oil. Management aims to minimise
the impact of commodity market volatility on (gross) margin and allow time to take
corrective pricing action. Commodity hedging is undertaken based on 100% of the
volume exposure around the pricing horizon, although hedging can be undertaken up to
52 weeks with approval and within limits.

       - Currency risk: FFG’s reporting currency is the euro. Its turnover is generally denominated
in the functional currencies of the markets in which FFG sells its products; the most
significant of these are the euro, the U.S. dollar and the pound sterling. FFG’s operating
costs (apart from commodity inputs) are generally denominated in the functional
currencies of the jurisdictions in which its operations (including manufacturing plants and

100


-----

distribution hubs) are located, which in most cases correlate to the markets and
currencies in which its sales are made. However, FFG is exposed to movements in the
underlying currency of transacted commodity prices that are mainly denominated in U.S.
dollars. A layered hedging approach of up to 12 months is used to hedge this foreign
currency transaction exposure. FFG does not hedge against translation risks that arise
from the translation of local currency income statement or balance sheet results into
euros. Following the Transactions, we will also be exposed to currency risk related to
indebtedness denominated in various currencies, principally the euro, the U.S. dollar and
the pound sterling. We are managing this risk by implementing the natural hedge of
incurring different tranches of our indebtedness under our Senior Term Facilities in the
various principal currencies in which FFG’s turnover is denominated.

       - Interest rate risk: Our exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
primarily to our long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. Historically, since
we did not have long-term borrowings with floating interest rates, we did not use
derivative instruments to hedge interest risk. In connection with the proceeds from the
bond and the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement we may enter into derivative hedging to
hedge interest risk.

The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a specified change in interest rates, with all
other variables held constant:

**Increase/(decrease) in interest expense**
**assuming 1% change in applicable**

**Market Interest Rate** **interest rate**

(€ in millions)
EURIBOR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20.0
GBP LIBOR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.9
USD LIBOR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.9
WIBOR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.8

The above risks may affect FFG’s income and expenses, the measure value of its assets and liabilities,
or the value of its financial instruments. FFG’s objective in managing market risk is to maintain it within
acceptable parameters, while optimizing returns. Generally, FFG applies hedge accounting to manage
the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and judgments are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future
period affected. Information about critical judgments in applying accounting policies, as well as
estimates and assumptions that have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below:

    - Operating costs and non-underlying items:

       - Brand and marketing investment: Brand and Marketing investment includes costs
incurred for the purpose of building and maintaining brand equity and awareness. These
include media, advertising production, promotional materials and engagement with
consumers. These costs are charged to the income statement as incurred;

       - Research and development: Expenditure on research and development includes staff
costs, material costs, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and other costs
directly attributable to research and product development activities. These costs are
charged to the income statement as incurred;

       - Non-underlying items: Non-underlying items include restructuring costs and other one-off
items within operating profit, and other significant and unusual items within net profit but
outside of operating profit, which Unilever’s spreads business collectively terms

101


-----

non-underlying items due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence. These items are
significant in terms of nature and/or amount and are relevant to an understanding of the
spreads business’ financial performance. Restructuring costs are charges associated
with activities planned by management that significantly change either the scope of the
business or the manner in which it is conducted;

    - Taxation:

       - Income tax: Unilever’s spreads business is subject to taxation in the many countries in
which it operates. The tax legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is
subject to interpretation by management and the government authorities. These matters
of judgment give rise to the need to create provisions for tax payments that may arise in
future years. Provisions are made against individual exposures and take into account the
specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical arguments,
recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice.

    - Provisions:

       - Provisions are recognized where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance
sheet date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably
estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.

    - Commitments and contingent liabilities:

       - Lease payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

       - Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. All other leases are classified as
operating leases.

       - Assets held under finance leases are initially recognized at the lower of fair value at the
date of commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets are accounted for in
accordance with the accounting policy relating to that specific asset. The corresponding
liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments
are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and a reduction of the
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability.

       - Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a
transfer of economic benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not,
require a transfer of economic benefits. It is not appropriate to make provisions for
contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will result in an obligation in the
future. Contingent liabilities are disclosed at the risk adjusted best estimate of the amount
that would be required to settle the liability as at the balance sheet date. Where a risk
weighting is not available, the maximum exposure is reported.

Because of the nature of combined financial statements, there are additional critical assumptions and
estimates made in preparing the combined financial statements, as explained in “Presentation of
_Financial_ _and_ _Other_ _Information,”_ “—Explanation _of_ _Certain_ _Income_ _Statement_ _Items”_ and
“—Explanation of Certain Balance Sheet Items”.

**Overview**

FFG is primarily active in global B&M, creams, vegetable oils and some adjacent markets. It sells its
products through retail and foodservice channels in 69 markets, either directly to retailers and
wholesalers or via third party distributors. FFG’s customer base consists of global leaders in retail and
foodservice.

**Retail channel**

**_Butter and Margarine_**

B&M is a large, global category of packaged food products with a total retail volume of approximately
six million tonnes in 2016, according to FFG’s estimates. According to Euromonitor International
(Source: Euromonitor International, Packaged Food 2018 edition, data extracted February 2018), the
global retail sales value of the category, which encompasses B&M only since Euromonitor International
does not separate mélanges into a distinct category, was €29 billion in 2016. This puts B&M above
categories such as breakfast cereals (estimated at €25 billion), savory biscuits (€22 billion) and pasta
(€21 billion). The category’s products have been mostly associated with spreading, baking and cooking
occasions, with other markets such as leavened bread (used for spreading) and foodservice (which
shifts emphasis away from home cooking and baking) influencing the dynamic of volume development.
On the value side, pricing in the category is influenced by the commodity cycle for dairy (butter) and
vegetable oils (margarine).

FFG is the leader in the global B&M market. According to Euromonitor International, in 2016 it had a
17.7% market share (by value) in the markets in which it was present, making it the leading player in
both developed and emerging markets, with 18.2% and 15.6% of these markets, respectively, on a
retail sales value basis. The markets in which FFG is present are set forth in the table entitled “FFG’s
Key Markets” below. FFG’s value market share was four times larger than its next largest competitor,
Arla (source: Euromonitor International, 2016). FFG estimates that, by volume, it had a market share of
23.0% globally (23.6% in developed markets and 20.6% in emerging markets), with the highest volume
share, based on retail margarine volume ranking, in 44 markets, representing 89% of its turnover in
2016. Aside from Arla, FFG’s key branded competitors include Land O’Lakes, Lactalis, Bunge, Ornua
and Conagra. For most of its global competitors, butter and margarine is a minor part of their portfolio.
FFG considers private label margarine producers to be its key competitors in the markets in which it is
present. According to Euromonitor International (Source: Euromonitor International, Packaged Food
2018 edition, data extracted February 2018), the market share (in total retail sales value) of private
label margarine producers in the markets where we are present was 18.9% in 2016.

FFG estimates that the global B&M market volume declined at a rate of 0.8% per annum from 2013 to
2016, driven by decreasing volume consumption in its developed markets. FFG believes that the key
contributing factor was the decreasing number of occasions for baking, cooking and spreading.
According to Euromonitor International, in FFG’s key markets (being the U.S.A., Germany, U.K. and
Netherlands), leavened bread retail volume consumption decreased at a rate of 1% per annum during
2013 to 2016, thereby decreasing the number of spreading occasions. The decline in bread
consumption has been amplified by a move from carbohydrate-based to protein-based diets.
Consumers have also been switching to alternative spreads, such as chocolate spreads, mayonnaise
and vegetable-based dips. According to data from Euromonitor International and GlobalData Plc., the
consumption of alternative spreads has grown at a rate of 1% per annum from 2013 to 2016 across the
U.S.A., Germany, U.K. and the Netherlands. Channel-wise, retail consumption has been slowing due
to an overall shift towards foodservice and a corresponding decrease in cooking and baking occasions.
According to Euromonitor International (Source: Euromonitor International, Retailing 2017 edition,
Consumer Foodservice 2017 edition, data extracted June 2017), from 2012 to 2016, the average
market value of foodservice spend (across the U.S.A., Germany, U.K. and Netherlands) grew at 3.8%
per annum, faster than grocery retail sales, which grew 2.6% per annum during the same period.

The trend in margarine consumption has also been exacerbated by the fact that butter has been
perceived as more natural and functional, and has performed better than margarine in taste tests, due
to its higher fat content. Until early January 2016, the declining butter price (in part driven by the
removal of production quotas in the EU and the ban on milk and dairy imports in Russia, a significant
dairy importer) had decreased butter’s price differential against margarine. These factors, together with
emergence of spreadable butters (such as mélanges), has led to a decrease in the volume share of
margarine within the butter and margarine market from 60.2% in 2013 to 55.7% in 2016, according to
our estimates. This price trend, however, has since reversed due to a severe cut in dairy supply,
driving up prices for butter in Europe.

Despite the historical mild decline in developed markets, B&M remain everyday staples with high
penetration and usage, and as such are a key category for retailers. Consumption per capita is the
highest in Continental Europe, and has significant room for further growth in emerging markets.

The vast majority of households in FFG’s key developed markets are B&M users, and a significant
proportion of the population consume margarine in particular on a weekly, and even daily, basis. This
contrasts with some emerging markets, such as Indonesia, where the category has substantial
potential for growth.

FFG estimates that B&M experienced sustained volume growth in emerging markets of 1.4% per
annum from 2013 to 2016. This growth was facilitated by traditionally lower B&M consumption
compared to developed markets, which FFG believes was due to limited leavened bread consumption
(14kg and 1kg per capita in Mexico and Indonesia in 2016, compared to 30kg per capita in U.K. during
the same period, per FFG’s estimates), lower frequency of usage compared to developed markets, the
correlation between consumption volumes and affluence and limited distribution in emerging markets.

FFG believes that the distribution of B&M in emerging markets is limited by the continued prevalence
of traditional trade. For instance, FFG estimates that traditional trade constituted up to 61% of
margarine retail value in Mexico in 2016, and 76% in Indonesia during the same period. Traditional
trade is typically highly fragmented and often lacks chilled infrastructure, imposing structural
constraints on B&M availability for products lacking shelf stability, resulting in lower weighted
distribution for the category compared to developed markets such as the U.K.

The availability of infrastructure, together with a lack of dairy tradition and the high price sensitivity of
consumers, has led to generally lower penetration of dairy products and butter in a number of
emerging markets. For instance, in East Asia lactose intolerance is a common factor limiting the use of

butter. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, in some East Asian Communities, up to 90%
of adults are lactose-intolerant. Beyond that, FFG believes that in many African and Asian markets,
margarine’s nutritional and health benefits (especially vitamin and Omega 3 and 6 content) have been
a key consideration for consumers. According to the UNICEF/WHO/World Bank 2017 report “Levels
and trends in Child Malnutrition”, malnutrition remains a key challenge for many children in emerging
markets, creating substantial demand for affordable nutritious foods. Overall, FFG believes that the
perception of margarine has been significantly more positive in emerging markets compared to
developed markets, as evidenced by continued volume growth. According to the Management survey
conducted in June 2017, in FFG’s key emerging markets, such as Indonesia and Mexico, its margarine
products have experienced better or a very narrow gap in perception in relation to butter products.

We believe that emerging markets offer ample headroom for growth, given significantly lower
consumption rates, even where penetration is on par with developed markets. In our view, the driving
factors of this growth are the continued increase in population, growth in leavened bread consumption
(and concomitant increase in spreading occasions), growth in affluence, widening distribution capability
and the adoption of localized approaches to foster margarine use cases (to be promoted, to a large
extent, by FFG itself given its key position within the margarine category). Margarine, in particular, is
well-positioned to exploit high price elasticity in relation to butter and a more positive consumer
perception.

_Key FFG Markets Overview_

In its key markets, FFG is the leading B&M player in value terms. In the Netherlands, where margarine
consumption is among the highest in Europe, FFG is a clear leader in the wider B&M space, outpacing
the entire private label segment. Aside from private label players, its key competitors in developed
markets include Conagra and Pinnacle in the U.S.A.; Bunge, Arla and Friesland Campina in Germany;
Dairy Crest and Arla in the U.K.; and Friesland Campina in the Netherlands. While margarine market
shares have been generally stable or growing, in the wider butter and margarine space, FFG has seen
a loss of market share to butter players over recent years for the reasons discussed above.

In FFG’s key emerging markets, it commands an even greater market share in B&M categories when
compared to developed markets. FFG’s branded product competition includes primarily local players,
such as Indofood in Indonesia and Sigma Alimentos in Mexico, as well as sometimes including
“copycat” brand manufacturers, as seen in some African countries. FFG’s market shares in the
margarine category have generally been stable, though local competition has been intensifying in
recent years.

**_Creams_**

Creams constitute a sizeable category of packaged food with €13.6 billion in global retail sales value in
2016 (Source: Euromonitor International, Packaged Food 2018 edition, data extracted December
2017), including all types of cream (e.g. single, double, clotted, whipped, sour, crème fraiche and
soy-based). According to the same source, the top 10 countries by value account for 65% of the global
market, with the top three markets being the U.S.A., Russia and Germany. FFG is present in retail
creams across a number of European markets, namely: Germany, the U.K., Sweden and Poland
(which account for 4 out of the 10 largest global creams markets, according to Euromonitor
International), as well as Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, Austria, Netherlands and Ireland. FFG also
has a smaller presence in the Czech Republic and Belgium.

According to company estimates based on Euromonitor International, the top 10 cream markets grew
at 4.4% CAGR from 2011 to 2016 and growth is expected to decelerate slightly to +3.8% CAGR during
2017 to 2022, with Germany the best growing current FFG market at 4.1% CAGR.

Overall, FFG believes that the creams market has been more stable than the butter and margarine
market in most developed countries due to the majority of use cases being in baking and cooking,
which were less vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences. DCAs are a fast growing
sub-segment of the creams market, driven by increased consumer focus on dietary requirements.

FFG believes that the top key product characteristics in creams are performance and functionality
(i.e. ease-of-use of the package, product variety, whipping functionality, “binding and shifting”
properties). Functionality is then followed by taste, price and brand.

_Key FFG Markets Overview_

Creams accounted for 4% (€125.0 million) of FFG’s 2016 retail turnover. FFG’s largest creams
markets in 2016 were Germany, the U.K. and Netherlands, with retail turnover of €41.3 million,
€34.3 million and €10.6 million, respectively.

FFG’s market shares in creams are significantly smaller than those in B&M, given less focus on this
segment historically. We believe that FFG has significant scope to increase its market share as part of
its current strategy, as well as the potential to roll out its offering to other markets.

FFG believes that its DCA products offer significant performance benefits over competitors: creams do
not curdle, are more stable to whipping, can be allergen free and have a longer shelf life. However,
FFG recognizes that some competitors have more functional packaging and a wider range of stock
keeping units, which therefore offers us a potential for even further improvement.

_Germany_

The total sales value of the German creams market amounted to €815 million in 2016, after slight
declines in the past (1.0% per annum from 2011 to 2016) driven by a decreasing number of cooking
and baking occasions. According to Nielsen, the largest sub-segment of the German creams market in
2016 was whipping cream, which accounted for approximately 42% of the market, followed by ambient
whipping cream and sour cream, accounting for 17% and 18%, respectively.

In 2016, FFG had a market share of 4.2% of the total creams market in Germany (per FFG’s
estimates), with approximately 73% of the cooking cream segment, and less than 5% market share in
the whipping cream, crème fraiche, sour cream and other segments (source: Nielsen). While FFG does
not currently offer ambient whipping cream and vegan creams, we believe there is significant upside to
be gained through entering the ambient creams market and increasing FFG’s share in whipping
creams. FFG is most active in the German creams market through its Rama Cremefine brand, which is
positioned as an alternative to dairy creams and competes at a similar price point, but with addedvalue flavorings and functional benefits.

_U.K._

According to Company’s estimates based on Euromonitor International, the creams market in the U.K.
accounted for €0.3 billion in total sales value in 2016. The market is estimated to have grown by 3.6% per
annum from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to slow to 0.1% from 2016-2022. FFG estimates that it
accounted for 11% of the market in 2016, including with its Elmlea brand, positioned as a lower cost DCA.

_Netherlands_

According to Company’s estimates based on Euromonitor International, the Dutch creams market
accounted for €0.1 billion in total sales value in 2016. The market is estimated to have grown by
approximately 1.6% per annum from 2011 to 2016, with the market expected to decline at 0.1% per
annum until 2022. FFG believes that it accounted for no more than 11% of the market in 2016 with its
Blue Band and Becel brands. Blue Band creams occupy a similar positioning to Rama Cremefine as a
DCA, while Becel currently offers a range of non-core coffee creams.

**Distribution**

FFG’s route to market is structured differently depending on the geography and channel. In line with
the total retail market structure, almost all sales in the retail channel in developed markets are via
modern retail supermarket chains. Apart from a few exceptions, distribution is completed by the
retailer, with FFG only responsible for delivering the products to their distribution centers. In emerging
markets, FFG tends to work with modern retailers directly, while traditional trade outlets are reached
largely via different intermediaries, including cash and carries, wholesalers (who carry out distribution
themselves), and other distribution partners.

**Foodservice channel**

FFG’s foodservice same year portfolio focuses more on creams and liquids than its retail portfolio. 85%
of FFG’s retail turnover in 2016 was generated by plant-based spreads, with 4% generated by creams,
while 54% of its foodservice turnover in the same year was generated by plant-based spreads, with
creams generating 25%.

According to Company estimates, in 2016, the global B&M foodservice market accounted for 2.4 billion
kilograms of butter and margarine in developed markets (in countries where FFG is present), 1.0 billion
kilograms in emerging markets where it is present and 1.4 billion kilograms in non-FFG markets.
Foodservice accounts for 43% of global B&M market volumes, which varies by region from 34% in
Africa and the Middle East to 71% in Asia.

Foodservice has grown faster than retail due to a shift towards out-of-home eating within developed
markets. For example, the company estimates margarine volumes in the social and commercial
channel decreased at 2% per annum during 2013 to 2016 in the U.S.A., U.K., Germany and the
Netherlands, compared to a decrease of 7% per annum in the retail channel during the same period.
Out-of-home dining spend grew by approximately 3% per annum from 2013 to 2016 according to
Euromonitor International.

The foodservice segment has less exposure to consumer factors. Foodservice products are typically
used for cooking and baking, and therefore declining bread consumption has little impact on volumes.
The trend towards natural products has less effect in back-of-house uses where functionality and
reliability benefits are more important (for example, margarine makes spongier cakes and performs
better than butter within quiches). The taste impact on final dishes is often limited, meaning less
substitution towards butter.

The company believes that social and commercial foodservice spend will continue to grow and is
expected to outperform retail as a channel by 1% from 2016 to 2020 within the U.S.A., U.K., Germany
and the Netherlands, with lower exposure to consumer factors providing a further 5% uplift for
margarine volumes.

Overall, the company expects B&M in foodservice (including industrial and artisanal volumes) will
continue to grow at 1.7% per annum from 2016 to 2022, and creams in foodservice are expected to
grow at 1.1% per annum during the same period, based on market data from Euromonitor
International, GlobalData Plc. and wholesale sales data.

The foodservice market consists of three sub-segments: social and commercial, artisanal and
industrial. The social and commercial sub-segment accounts for 34% of total estimated foodservice
market volumes for B&M and includes servicing cafes, restaurants, canteens, hotels. The industrial
sub-segment includes industrial baking and deep frying, as well as sandwich manufacturing.
Management have only sized the industrial baking portion of this, which makes up 49% of the
estimated market. There is therefore a further opportunity beyond the sized market, for example in
deep frying which is currently dominated by oil products but can be served by margarine. The
remaining 16% of the estimated foodservice market is in the artisanal sub-segment, which serves
small-scale bakeries.

FFG currently only operates in the social and commercial sub-segment, with upside potential for
penetrating into other sub-segments of the foodservice market. FFG believes that key consumer
criteria in the social sub-segment are low price (due to the need to offer affordable dishes) and ease of
use (particularly for inexperienced and lower-skilled chefs). In the commercial sub-segment, key
product characteristics are quality, taste and price, as well as functionality (ease and efficiency of use)
and reliability.

_FFG Market Positioning_

FFG’s sales via the foodservice channel accounted for 9% of its overall business in 2016. Within this
channel, FFG’s products are sold in 50 countries, with Indonesia, the U.K. and Switzerland being the
largest markets (representing €35 million, €31 million and €21 million in turnover, respectively).

The overall foodservice market across FFG’s product categories is highly fragmented, and it competes
against multiple regional and national players. FFG believes that the only other global player in
branded margarine is Bunge, but also believes that Vandemoortele is a major competitor, with
approximately 30% market share in margarine in the Netherlands and approximately 20% in Germany.
However, Vandemoortele is only active within Europe, with its primary focus on the artisanal
sub-segment. Major regional players in branded margarine tend to have significant foodservice
divisions. For instance, over 20% of ConAgra’s revenue is derived from foodservice.

Based on chef and foodservice sales team interviews, FFG’s foodservice customers rate FFG
particularly highly when compared to alternatives on dimensions of functionality and reliability, as well
as underlying brand strength. FFG has historically positioned its products at a premium to those of its
competitors. FFG believes that its combination of well-known brands and value-added services
provided to foodservice operators (including organized staff training and product instruction, sharing
recipes, etc.) justifies such positioning and pricing levels.

Based on management data, FFG holds significant market shares in several key markets, in the
channels in which it operates (44% in Indonesia, 45% in the U.K. and 50% in Germany). Historically,
Unilever considered foodservice to be dilutive to margins, and therefore had limited focus on the
channel. This has manifested in a number of ways, including limited outlet selection (e.g. fewer
bakers), lower brand and marketing investment, lack of focus of sales teams and limited research and
development investments. Therefore, management believes there is significant potential to grow within
FFG’s existing markets, as well as to expand into new markets.

**Distribution**

The overall global market of foodservice outlets is large, and includes approximately 20 million outlets
globally based on a management exercise in 2014. This is comprised of various channels, including

111


-----

social (23%), restaurants (50%), cafes, pubs and bars (18%) and hotels and other (the remaining 9%).
72% of foodservice sales occur in independent outlets and 28% in chains. Within the chains, a large
proportion of the outlets are franchises. Given that the majority of global outlets are independent,
wholesalers and distributors play an important role in route-to-market and influencing end consumers.
According to a management exercise conducted in 2014, direct sales to outlet chains only represented
13% of FFG’s foodservice turnover during that year, while the rest of its sales were effected through
wholesalers.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

FFG is the world’s leading producer of plant-based and other blended spreads, with leading market
positions in both developed and emerging markets and products sold in over 69 countries. A historic
part of Unilever, FFG will, through the Transactions, become a stand-alone leader in its industry, four
times larger than its nearest global-branded competitor, boasting a global portfolio of iconic consumer
brands, with seven of its key brands each generating at least €175 million in turnover in the year ended
December 31, 2017. FFG has 17 manufacturing facilities located throughout the developed and
emerging markets in which it operates, as well as world-class research and development capabilities
that have put it at the forefront of the plant-based spreads industry.

FFG’s principal product line is Plant-Based Spreads, which accounted for 83% of its turnover in the
year ended December 31, 2017. This is complemented by its line of dairy cream alternatives, which
represented 6% of turnover for the same period, Liquids products (including liquid margarine,
vegetable cooking oils and olive oil), which represented 7% of turnover for the same period, and other
products which represented 4% of turnover for the same period.

FFG is a market leader in North America and Western Europe and has a strong presence across
emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia with number one positions in 44
of its 69 markets. In each of these countries, FFG sells its products predominantly to retail outlets,
including to many of the world’s largest retailers and their chains of supermarkets, hypermarkets,
convenience stores and e-commerce platforms, as well as to wholesalers. FFG also supplies the
foodservice channel, including restaurants, hotels, workplace and educational canteens and healthcare
facilities.

In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, FFG had turnover of €3,294.9 million,
€3,031.7 million and €2,904.9 million, respectively, net profit of €453.6 million, €422.5 million and
€565.1 million, respectively, and Normalized EBITDA of €723.0 million, €686.3 million and
€674.0 million, respectively. Pro Forma Normalized EBITDA was €819.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

**History**

The FFG business traces its origin to the first days of what is now Unilever, in the early 20[th] century.
The FFG business was one of the earliest large-scale producers of margarine and many of its current
brands, including Blue Band in the Netherlands and Rama in Germany enjoy heritage spanning almost
a century. FFG’s Becel margarine was introduced in response to some of the first studies showing the
impact of polyunsaturated fats on lowering cholesterol levels. The FFG business continued to develop
technology to reduce the levels of saturated fats and improve the nutritional profile of its products
throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the 2000s, the FFG business was one of the first major food
producers to eliminate all trans fatty acids from its products. The FFG business has continued its track
record of innovation through the invention of its fast blending and cool blending processes which have
helped to consolidate its current market leading position.

**Separation from Unilever**

While the FFG business had historically been fully integrated into Unilever’s operations, the separation
process which has culminated in the Acquisition began in 2015 with the reorganization of Unilever’s
Baking, Cooking and Spreads business in Europe and North America into the BCS entities, which
accounted for 70% of FFG’s turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017. Since then, a rigorous
process has been undertaken to develop a separation blueprint to facilitate FFG becoming a fully
stand-alone entity. Going forward, we will be a single category business benefitting from a simplified
operating model and including dedicated single-category customer development, marketing and
research and development teams allowing greater focus on top-line performance.

Our markets will be organized into six business units, North America, Northwest Europe, Southwest
Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle and Latin America and Asia and Africa, each with
integrated retail and foodservice businesses. Each business unit has a lead country which oversees

113


-----

the other jurisdictions in the unit. Each lead country contains at least one manufacturing site and has
additional back office support capabilities to service the needs of the other countries in the business
unit, including with respect to human resources and IT. Lead countries will also take greater
responsibility for customer development and marketing strategy within the business units. In addition to
the lead country, business units will be made up of direct sales countries, which will be led by a country
manager. Where appropriate, direct sales countries will also have their own customer development
teams, local marketing capability and back office support. In several our smaller markets (currently
projected at 35), we will shift to a distributor model, with third-party distributor partners undertaking all
sales, marketing, logistics, cash collection and back office functions in those markets. These markets
will be managed out of the business unit lead country or a satellite country, with no significant FFG
operations on the ground.

In addition to FFG’s 17 manufacturing facilities, production will be supported by longer term co-packing
arrangements with eight Unilever manufacturing sites. A number of other services, including IT, will be
provided pursuant to transitional services arrangements with Unilever, on time horizons ranging from
six to 18 months from the date of separation.

**Strengths**

We believe that FFG benefits from the following key strengths:

**_Number one player globally with a leading portfolio of iconic brands_**

FFG has a strong portfolio of diversified, iconic brands that are well represented across both developed
and emerging markets. In the year ended December 31, 2016, FFG had an approximately 32% share
of the global margarine market and, within the global B&M category, was more than four times larger
than the number two player. Across its core developed markets, FFG has very strong market
positioning, with a share of the margarine segment greater than 50% in the U.S.A (59%), Germany
(63%), the U.K. (57%) and the Netherlands (74%) in the year ended December 31, 2016, based on
retail sales value. With a history of manufacturing and distributing category-leading products for nearly
150 years, FFG has an established global position with demonstrable brand recognition and customer
loyalty.

FFG has seven brands with a turnover of at least €175 million. These brands are Becel (2017 turnover:
€327 million), Rama (2017 turnover: €321 million), Blue Band (2017 turnover: €254 million), Country
Crock (2017 turnover: €242 million), Flora (2017 turnover: €208 million), I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter!
(2017 turnover: €197 million) and ProActiv (2017 turnover: €175 million). FFG’s portfolio benefits from
strong brand equity, enjoying an average aided brand awareness of approximately 89% (in 2016),
according to Millward Brown, making them some of the most recognizable packaged food brands in
their respective markets.

FFG’s brand range targets specific and distinct sub-categories within the B&M segment, such as family
nutrition, heart health, cholesterol lowering, taste, cooking & baking, and value. The comprehensive
range offered means that FFG caters for specific consumption across all main use occasions
(spreading, cooking and baking), formats (wrappers, tubs and liquids) and storing conditions (chilled,
ambient and tropical ambient products).

**_Diversified across geographies with leading country shares in both developed markets and_**
**_emerging markets_**

FFG is present in 69 countries globally with a number one position in the B&M category in 44 of these
countries, based on retail margarine volume ranking. These 44 markets represented 89% of FFG’s
turnover in 2016.

FFG is number one in 10 of its largest 11 countries by turnover. In its largest markets by
turnover—U.S.A., Germany and the U.K.—FFG has an approximately 60% share in the margarine
segment and was respectively three times, nine times and twice as large as the number two branded
player in each such country in the year ended December 31, 2016, measured by retail sales value. Of
these 11 markets, only in France was FFG the number two branded player in margarine, with a market
share of 35% (one percentage point behind the number one player by market share) in the year ended
December 31, 2016, based on retail sales value.

115


-----

FFG generated €2,302.0 million of turnover from its developed markets in the year ended
December 31, 2017, representing 79% of total sales. In developed markets, the business is present in
28 countries and number one in 22 of those countries, with key countries including the U.S.A.,
Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands.

FFG also benefits from significant scale in emerging markets, with €602.9 million of turnover attributed
to emerging markets in the year ended December 31, 2017, making it one of the largest emerging
markets food businesses globally. Emerging market countries represented 21% of total sales for the
year ended December 31, 2017, with the business present in 41 countries and number one in 24 of
these, with key countries including Kenya, Mexico and Indonesia. FFG maintains a strong position
across its growing emerging markets, as demonstrated by its share of the margarine segment in Kenya
(90%), Indonesia (63%) and Mexico (69%) in the year ended December 31, 2016, based on retail
sales value.

With its significant research and development capabilities supporting a comprehensive procurement,
production and distribution chain, FFG is well placed to expand into new geographies and consolidate
existing local market share. FFG is also well positioned to leverage its proprietary fast-blending
technology to enter new markets with lower upfront capital expenditure.

**_Strong and sustainable profitability and cash flow conversion_**

FFG has a demonstrated track record of strong profitability, with net profit of €422.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2016 and €565.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Normalized
EBITDA margin was 22.6% in the year ended December 31, 2016 and 23.2% in the year ended
December 31, 2017. Normalized EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 23.6% in
FFG’s developed markets and 21.9% in its emerging markets, reflecting the strength of FFG’s truly
global business. Pro Forma Normalized EBITDA was €819.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2017.

FFG benefits from strong cash generation and generated a net cash flow from operating activities of
€558.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 and €548.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017, with an underlying free cash flow conversion ratio of 94.2% in the year ended
December 31, 2016 and 99.8% in the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares favorably with
peers and is supported by the following:

    - Variable Cost Structure. Approximately 75% of FFG’s cost base is variable, allowing for a
sustainable gross margin. FFG has clear, consistent and well-established supply chain and
hedging policies with respect to its major commodity inputs and foreign exchange exposures,
which has allowed it to maintain strong levels of profitability after direct costs in changing cost
environments.

    - High profitability with separation upside. FFG has demonstrably high and sustained
profitability, with an Normalized EBITDA margin of greater than 20% in each of the financial
years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, largely attributable to FFG’s flexible cost
structure and recent track record of operational cost savings. We believe there is significant
scope for further improvement, as described below under “—Strategy—Realize significant
_cost savings opportunity.”_

    - Well-invested manufacturing base and supply chain. FFG has a comprehensive
manufacturing network with a well-invested supply chain and significant spare capacity,
including in its emerging markets. This allows for increased sales volumes without
incremental capital expenditure resulting in strong cash generation.

    - Efficient working capital position. FFG’s cash flow conversion is additionally supported by a
favorable working capital position. A normalized negative working capital position is the result
of effectively managed inventory, structurally low receivable days due to attractive payment
terms on customer rebates, and attractive standard payment terms for FFG’s key raw
materials (primarily edible oils). With beneficial relationships with its core suppliers, FFG is
able to leverage payment terms of up to 120 days to mitigate the risk that cash is
underutilized within the business. This is compared with average inventory days of 25 and
average receivable days from customers of 20, in each case for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

116


-----

**_A well-invested global manufacturing network with significant spare capacity_**

FFG’s approach to maintaining leading facilities and its strong historic cash flow generation has
enabled it to invest significantly in its global operations. FFG’s ten developed market and seven
emerging market facilities are fully invested, and have significant excess capacity, with unconstrained
utilization of 49% on average in the year ended December 31, 2016. This well-invested asset base
allowed for a low level of capital expenditure of 1.0% of turnover in the year ending December 31,
2017. Raw materials represented 45% of total supply chain costs and production costs represented
30% of total supply chain costs in the year ending December 31, 2017. In addition, in recent years,
FFG has invested significant capital in two new facilities. FFG invested over €200 million in 2014 and
2015 into its U.S. supply chain infrastructure, in particular the development of the New Century plant in
Kansas in the U.S.A., one of the biggest margarine facilities in the world. A new facility was also
constructed in Nigeria during 2016 and 2017, enabling access to high-growth West African markets.
Through these investments, FFG has also ensured it has the latest manufacturing innovations at its
disposal, including utilization of its proprietary cool blending and fast blending technologies (as detailed
further below).

**_Efficient supply chain infrastructure_**

FFG’s market leading products benefit from its sophisticated procurement, production and distribution
functions. FFG’s procurement process focuses on a simple portfolio of materials (primarily various oils
and blends) that it is able to source at competitive prices by leveraging its scale and flexibility. In the
year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 68% of FFG’s raw material costs were attributable to
six materials and approximately 45% of material value was procured through suppliers for which FFG
represented more than 75% of total Unilever spend.

FFG employs an asset-light distribution strategy, with most warehouses and all transport outsourced to
third parties. This allows forward-looking and market-driven inventory management with an average of
25 inventory days in the year ended December 31, 2017. Distribution costs accounted for 10% of
FFG’s total supply chain costs in the year ending December 31, 2017. In addition, there is expected to
be limited loss of distribution scale following the separation from Unilever, as over 81% of current
distribution spend within the business is on infrastructure and providers dedicated to FFG’s product
range, given the lack of other chilled food categories within Unilever.

**_Leading product knowledge and capability and proprietory processes_**

FFG has a leading research and development platform which has benefitted from consistent
investment throughout the cycle. Its strong capabilities allow FFG to turn technological breakthroughs
into commercial successes in a short turnaround period. FFG continually enhances consumer
experience by developing flavors in-house, leveraging in-depth know-how of melting behavior and
flavor release and by mapping flavor preferences in key segments and geographies. In collaboration
with governments and opinion formers, FFG has developed category leading products with nutritious
and stable characteristics, such as the only spreads product containing Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty
acids that is stable in ambient tropical conditions (such as those in Africa and Southeast Asia) and
products containing cholesterol-lowering ingredients. FFG has also partnered with local governments
in its emerging markets to launch public healthy eating campaigns, capitalizing on the perception of
margarine as a healthy and aspirational product in the region.

FFG also has a strong track record in process innovation. FFG has realized considerable cost benefits
from recipe formulation and raw material optimization, underpinning its cost leadership. In particular, it
has the ability to manage fluctuations in raw material costs while maintaining the optimal designed
performance and a rapid and pro-active development process allowing quick roll out across all
business units. FFG has been at the forefront of developing proprietary technologies and holds over
75 patents globally. In particular, FFG has developed several proprietary manufacturing processes,
including cool blending, which has given FFG a means of producing low fat margarine without
compromising taste and with clean-label capability, and fast blending, which provides lower production
costs and fast capacity expansion for emerging markets by using smaller scale and easily
transportable modular units.

117


-----

FFG has developed a more agile research and development process, enabling turnaround of new
products from initial concept to product in three to six months. With digital modelling techniques, FFG
is able to predict the structure and melting properties of its spreads formulas, allowing acceleration in
innovation and superior product performance.

With a focus on plant-based innovation, FFG has relaunched several of its core brands with a
repositioning toward attractive and compelling value propositions: 100% plant-based offerings,
premium butter flavored mélanges with enhanced dairy content, adjacent products under common
branding and clean-label offerings. Notable successes have been achieved in FFG’s developed
markets in 2017 with the launch of innovative products, such as the Becel chocolate spread in the
Netherlands and the “with butter” Rama range in Germany, which has had a significant impact on retail
sales in the country. For example, the underlying sales growth or USG in the year ended
December 31, 2017 for Fruit d’Or in France, Rama in Poland, Becel in the Nordics and Becel in the
Netherlands was +4.6%, +3.1%, +2.7% and +0.7%, respectively.

**_Experienced management team, already delivering on transformational strategy_**

FFG benefits from a management team with significant experience in the consumer packaged goods
industry. The senior management team has been part of FFG’s transition from a part of Unilever to a
stand-alone business and has been heavily involved in developing and preparing for the execution of
our business transformation plans. Management believes that it leads a strong organization with
talented individuals that fosters a market-driven, entrepreneurial culture.

Key accomplishments of FFG’s management team to date include: (i) delivery of underlying sales
growth improvement in developed markets in 2017, and robust growth across FFG’s emerging markets
through strategy execution and a significant increase in the number and impact of on-trend
innovations; (ii) strong, consistent profitability and cash generation across 2015-2017 through
managing FFG’s flexible cost structure and achieving significant cost savings; (iii) increased share of
the margarine segment in key geographies; and (iv) reorganization of FFG into a more agile and
consumer-centric business. Management’s plans to take the business to its next phase of
transformational development are very much under way, with demonstrable evidence of successful
implementation of its strategy since the reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into
the BCS entities in 2015. FFG’s management team is also expected to be incentivized by a typical
private equity incentive scheme tied to the overall performance of KKR’s investment in the business.

KKR has also moved to reinforce the team in its new existence as a stand-alone company by
announcing the appointment, effective as of closing of the Acquisition, of David Haines as Executive
Chairman and Jesper Andersen as our new Chief Financial Officer. Mr Haines and Mr Andersen will
bring experience and a track record of success in managing stand-alone businesses in the consumer
sector. See “Recent Developments—Executive Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Management
_Transition.”_

**Strategy**

FFG intends to capitalize on the foregoing strengths by implementing the following clear and
compelling strategy:

**_Accelerate clearly defined initiatives to stabilize Developed Markets_**

The factors which have resulted in historical underperformance in FFG’s developed markets have been
clearly identified, relating partly to external factors that have impacted the performance of the overall
margarine category and partly to internal constraints resulting from the business’ historical ownership
by Unilever.

External factors

External factors which have contributed to developed market underperformance include:

    - a moderate reduction in consumption occasions (e.g. bread consumption) in some developed
markets;

118


-----

    - consumer misconception around the healthiness of margarine relative to butter (in particular
due to legacy concerns around partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, which have not been
included in any of FFG’s products since 2012); and

    - a period of depressed European butter prices from the second half of 2014 through the first
half of 2017 due to the removal of dairy quotas in Europe and the imposition of the Russian
trade embargo on some European dairy products, resulting in a reduction in the differential
between margarine and butter prices, which has since reversed by the end of 2017.

Internal factors

As part of Unilever, FFG was constrained in its ability to develop an independent growth strategy. The
spreads category was not a core strategic priority for Unilever. As a result, until the internal
reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities and the creation of
the current dedicated management structure in 2015, the business had not been given sufficient
management focus and was run primarily to maintain margin and generate cash flows to enable
investment in other areas of Unilever’s business. These internal constraints included:

    - a limited response to changing consumer preferences toward naturalness and taste;

    - a lack of response to category shifts and insufficient investment through marketing and new
product launches; and

    - absence of a dedicated sales function and category leadership, with a limited focus on the
business as part of the ongoing dialogue with retailers despite Unilever’s significant market
shares in each of its core geographies, which resulted in lack of retailer engagement and
investment in growing the category.

Since the internal reorganization of the Developed Markets spreads business into the BCS entities
2015, FFG’s management have developed and commenced implementation of a comprehensive
strategy to stabilize the developed markets business and support a return to moderate growth. This
strategy is clearly centered on the importance of restoring the naturalness and health perception of
FFG’s key products, clearly defining the specific strategy for each brand, and improving the taste
profile of FFG products. In order to deliver these initiatives, FFG intends to make a one-time brand and
marketing investment of €175 million in total over the short to medium term.

In order to “revitalize the core” of its business, FFG management believes there are a number of key
areas that can be readily addressed with increased focus and attention:

_Naturalness and Health_

Management intends to re-align the consumer perception of margarine on the grounds of relative
health benefits to butter and the product’s overall naturalness. Margarine is fundamentally a natural,
plant-based product, and this message will be at the core of FFG’s marketing campaign aiming to
educate the public on margarine’s advantages over butter.

A key component of FFG’s strategy is to communicate more clearly the natural and healthy credentials
of margarine to consumers, enabled by more effectively leveraging key influencers such as social
media personalities and environmental and animal welfare groups to capture the growing plant-based
nutrition trend and transitioning to clean labels on key product ranges. FFG plans to advance
innovation focused on improving natural credentials in its core range and to redesign packaging of
these products to increase naturalness cues, with the potential to move to paper wrap and
biodegradable or transparent packaging that align more closely with the interests of modern
consumers. Notably, five out of FFG’s six key products do not currently have a clean-label offering
(Country Crock in the U.S.A. moved to clean label in 2015). This represents a significant opportunity
for FFG to invest in ensuring that its core family focused product offering contains no artificial
ingredients, thereby enhancing consumer perceptions of naturalness.

_Brand_

Management intends to focus on developing FFG’s brand portfolio to clarify the use occasion
positioning and price architecture of its key brands. Management believes these measures will enable

119


-----

more effective targeting of key consumer groups looking for specific features from their products, such
as plant-based nutrition or dairy-like taste, and clarity around use occasions, such as spreading,
cooking or baking. For example, FFG has begun to reposition the Country Crock brand in the U.S.A.
around the focused attributes of “plant-based” and naturalness through the introduction of a clean-label
product recipe, as well as marketing and packaging initiatives that have demonstrated positive traction
with consumers.

_Taste_

Under Unilever ownership, a strong focus on heart health imposed by internal corporate guidelines led
to significant reductions in fat content, which impacted overall taste and “mouth-feel”. Going forward,
FFG will refocus on taste through improving formulations, as well as selectively increasing fat levels in
certain products. In this way, the taste profile of FFG’s Plant-Based Spreads will be improved without
changing the overall ingredient composition and, through rollout of upgraded recipes and additional
variants, FFG intends to target specific groups of consumers looking for different flavor profiles (for
example, mélanges for butter consumers).

Management has started to implement this strategy in certain brands over the last 12-24 months with
positive initial results. The Rama brand, for example, has undergone significant repositioning and
product variation with a 100% plant-based core brand and the introduction of a distinct “with butter”
range. Relaunched in December 2016, the brand has seen an underlying sales growth increase of
5.8% by the quarter ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.

Based on these strategies for the developed markets, and with the aid of a dedicated and focused
sales force, FFG, as the largest player, expects to both drive stabilization of the margarine category
overall as well as win share from its key competitors.

**_Continue to drive and enhance strong performance in emerging markets_**

Emerging markets are a core part of FFG’s strategy, where FFG is able to leverage its strong brand
and superior technology to offer high value, healthy and nutritious products to families around the
world. In addition, FFG is the only manufacturer offering high levels of nutritious fats, including a
margarine product containing Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids that is stable in tropical ambient
conditions.

The growth in opportunity in emerging market countries is supported by the favorable macroeconomic
trends of strong population growth and rising real household incomes. There is also a notable
opportunity to drive consumption among consumers in these countries, with the average consumption
of B&M products per capita in FFG’s emerging markets being approximately one sixth of consumers in
developed markets.

Demand drivers in emerging markets are fundamentally different than in developed markets, with
breakfast and baking occasions, especially during the holiday periods, the primary consumption

120


-----

occasions in the emerging markets. Bread consumption is also increasing in selected FFG emerging
markets, which typically has a positive impact on the demand for B&M products. This trend offers an
opportunity for FFG to drive further penetration and create new consumption occasions to drive
volumes. Further, price elasticity is higher in emerging markets than in developed markets, which
further incentivizes consumers to choose margarine as an alternative to butter given its lower price.
Importantly, consumer perception of margarine in emerging markets is also fundamentally different:
customers typically see margarine as an aspirational product with strong taste and health attributes. In
particular, Blue Band, the leading FFG brand across emerging markets, is seen as an aspirational
product by consumers when compared to traditional cooking oils or private label spreads products.
This gives an incentive for consumers to “trade up” to FFG products on the back of higher purchasing
power due to strengthening macroeconomic conditions. The lack of chilled infrastructure also provides
a notable advantage for margarine (over butter) as margarine can be formulated to remain stable at
tropical ambient temperatures without refrigeration.

Management’s strategy for enhancing growth in emerging markets is based on the following core
drivers:

_Drive performance through operation as a standalone organization_

Operating as a standalone entity, FFG will be able to pursue opportunities that were not previously
considered when integrated within the wider Unilever business and quickly exploit new opportunities by
deploying the resources required. Management is focused on growing FFG’s share and penetration in
key emerging markets countries, which will be facilitated through operation as a standalone business.

_Focus on key health benefits in less-developed emerging markets countries_

Management intends to capitalize on the current perception of margarine in emerging markets as a
healthy, aspirational product by leveraging local partnerships with public stakeholders. Notably, FFG
recently launched a “Good Breakfast” program in partnership with governments in several African
countries to encourage healthy eating initiatives, which has reached millions of Africans to date.
Management believes that FFG can reproduce the same approach in other emerging markets
countries going forward to encourage healthy eating and additional use occasions for FFG’s natural
product range.

_Drive distribution_

There are a number of opportunities related to distribution strategies in emerging markets that FFG can
pursue in order to improve the effectiveness of its operations and allow for faster growth. As an
independent organization, FFG will be able to establish new relationships and enter underpenetrated
countries where management sees significant opportunities. FFG believes it will be able to drive
distribution in this way at limited incremental cost, given the current average unconstrained utilization
rate (49% in the year ended December 30, 2016) across its facilities, which will allow for significant
scope to grow volumes. FFG recently invested in a new manufacturing plant in Nigeria which provides
the potential for growth opportunities across West Africa, allowing for increased regional distribution in
countries like Nigeria and Ghana.

Finally, beyond the geographies in which FFG is currently present, there are potential opportunities in
emerging markets not included in management’s current business plan, which represent a significant
source of additional upside.

**_Realize significant cost savings opportunity_**

In addition to revenue improvement and stabilization initiatives, FFG’s strategy also has a strong focus
on delivering cost savings and unlocking margin improvement potential. KKR, management and thirdparty diligence providers have conducted a comprehensive and granular review of FFG’s operating
model. We believe that as a stand-alone business, FFG will be able to realize significant cost savings
through the implementation of its business transformation strategy based on its track record of
delivering efficiencies. Through this process, a number of cost efficiency levers have been clearly

121


-----

identified relating to the five following areas: (i) procurement; (ii) manufacturing; (iii) supply chain;
(iv) brand, marketing and investment (“BMI”) and (v) SG&A optimization. The Issuer estimates that
these represent, in the aggregate, an annual run-rate cost savings of approximately €200 million,
which the Issuer believes can be achieved over the medium term with the incurrence of approximately
€45 million to €50 million of non-recurring restructuring and related costs. The five areas of cost
optimization are outlined further below:

_Procurement and design to value_

Procurement within Unilever has been largely centralized and was outside of the control of FFG
management, thereby providing significant scope to transition to best practices within the procurement
function. The key raw materials (palm, rapeseed, soybean, sunflower and canola oils) are primarily
sourced from six large suppliers with purchases covering requirements for the next 12 to 24 weeks.
The current procurement policies lack focus on volume consolidation and strategic sourcing
partnerships and do not fully exploit potential discount opportunities. Management believes that FFG’s
major suppliers are keen to secure volumes due to their relatively low margins and the large costs
associated with having to scale production up or down and there is therefore a significant cost saving
opportunity for FFG through volume bundling, entering into longer-term contracts and tendering
competitively across major suppliers.

Packaging-related cost savings entail the application of design-to-value principles and best-practice
procurement principles. Through design-to-value, FFG will be able to identify product features that
consumers value most in order to optimize the cost structure while still addressing key demand drivers.
Examples include simplifying the packaging of key products (s.a. moving away from aluminum foil to
lighter materials and reducing the lid thickness), which would enable FFG to save costs without
impacting customer perception and product appeal. Separately, FFG intends to adopt best-practice
procurement principles via entering into competitive tender processes and global consolidation with
scaled suppliers in order to optimize packaging input costs.

We believe that the largest cost efficiency opportunity of the five identified above will be in
procurement.

_Manufacturing cost optimization_

Post carve-out cost efficiencies are anticipated across the manufacturing network. On a carve-out
basis, FFG operated in Europe with an average unconstrained utilization rate of 49% in the year ended
December 31, 2016, with production costs varying significantly throughout the European manufacturing
base from €76/ton to €270/ton. Other identified areas for manufacturing-related cost savings include
(i) enhanced planning and staffing especially since multiple machines are running at low capacity,
(ii) technology upgrades and use of more energy-efficient machinery/processes, (iii) launch of
preventive maintenance programs and (iv) reduction of scrap and waste levels.

We believe that the second largest cost efficiency opportunity of the five identified above will be in
manufacturing.

_Supply chain cost optimization_

Following the Acquisition, FFG’s European distribution network will comprise 18 distribution centers.
FFG currently serves almost every European country from local warehouses with limited cross-border
or direct shipments to customers. As a result, we believe that there are significant distribution structure
overlaps/duplications in certain countries. Separately, management believes that the supply chain
costs could be further optimized via competitive tendering of transport lanes, re-designing routes based
on FFG’s streamlined distribution network and increasing the share of direct shipments to customers.

_BMI optimization_

FFG’s BMI spend for the financial year ended December 31, 2017 was 7.3% of revenue, above the
range among peers in the wider consumer sector of between 2.3% to 5.8%. Within Unilever, current
BMI spend is generally split across countries by their respective share of FFG’s total revenue, and
essentially supports the entire portfolio of brands.

The Issuer and its third-party commercial advisers have reviewed current spend practices in BMI on a
bottom-up basis and identified opportunities to optimize marketing spend practices. We intend to

122


-----

reduce BMI spend as a percent of turnover through several key initiatives, including: (i) reallocation of
budget to more effective marketing channels including digital, (ii) better execution across all channels
by exploring tactical media planning levers and (iii) optimization of spend through working with more
agile, smaller agencies. In order to deliver these initiatives, we intend to make an incremental one-time
brand and marketing investment of up to €175 million in total, over the short to medium term.

_SG&A optimization_

KKR has performed a top down benchmarking exercise of SG&A overhead costs (which excludes
BMI), which accounted for 10.9% of our revenue in 2017, and a bottom-up review of organizational
design. As part of the Acquisition, FFG will set up central standalone operations for Finance, IT,
Marketing, HR, Procurement and Legal functions. This exercise would entail hiring in excess of 500
staff across key support functions. Levers to optimize the cost structure include (i) right-sizing G&A
support organization to peer efficiency benchmark level, (ii) strengthening of Customer Development
during transition and optimizing to peer efficiency level and (iii) streamlining of research and
development portfolio and local organization, including focusing on key cross-country innovation and
adding skills such as value packaging engineering.

**_Exploit positive trends in Foodservice_**

While FFG is a key player in the global retail channel with an approximately 32% share of the global
margarine & spreads category, FFG has a limited presence in the foodservice channel, as pursuing
this route-to-market channel was not previously a key focus under Unilever ownership. Operating as a
standalone business, FFG is well positioned to take advantage of the significant growth opportunities in
the global foodservice channel. Foodservice has grown faster than retail due to two main reasons. The
first is the shift towards out-of-house eating within developed markets; “eating out” grew at a compound
annual growth rate of 3% per annum between 2014 and 2016. The second is the structurally lower
exposure to changing consumer factors – consumer perceptions regarding the “naturalness” of
margarine have less of an impact on the purchasing decisions made by foodservice operators. As
typical use cases for margarine in foodservice relate to cooking and baking, where the presence of
margarine in the final product is not apparent, factors such as declining use occasions for spreading
due to declining bread consumption, misinformed perception of margarine’s health benefits and taste
issues have not impacted the foodservice channel, which has shown its resilience. There is significant
potential for FFG to increase its presence within the foodservice channel, using its retail platform to
fast-track its expansion into this segment.

FFG currently participates only in the social and commercial channel within the foodservice channel
(e.g. hotels, restaurants and institutional canteens) which is primarily a branded sub-category that
accounted for approximately 34% of the non-retail B&M category globally in 2016. The unbranded
artisanal and industrial channels, which together represented approximately 65% of the total non-retail
category globally in 2016, provide a significant and under-explored opportunity. Management believes
there is a significant opportunity to expand penetration of the foodservice channel through FFG’s
existing business infrastructure. The capacity available across FFG’s current manufacturing and supply
chain network will enable FFG to complement its retail footprint with an expanded foodservice offering,
particularly by concentrating on direct sales to the largest end users and by pursuing relationships with
selected wholesalers that have a foodservice focus. The demonstrable functional and cost benefits of
FFG’s products, including DCA’s longer shelf life and value compared with dairy products, and ability to
withstand high temperatures and acidity levels without splitting, as well as FFG’s ability to produce
allergen-free products and the products’ favorable cost comparison to butter, position the business
strongly to take advantage of this growing channel.

**_Leverage iconic brand portfolio, expertise and market position to expand into growing adjacent_**
**_categories_**

Diet and health issues are at the forefront of the global packaged foods industry. In recent years,
consumers have become increasingly conscious of what they eat, conditions such as gluten and dairy
intolerance have become more widely recognized and more people are following “flexitarian”,
vegetarian and vegan diets. There is an increasingly strong awareness of the benefits of plant-based
diets, which FFG is well placed to exploit.

Leveraging its product expertise, research and development capability and manufacturing capacity to
further expand into plant-based products and adjacent categories is a key component of FFG’s

123


-----

strategy. FFG plans to build on the “free-from” diet and health trend by extending its strongest brands
into dairy-free milk and yogurt alternatives. Further expansion into alternative and sweet spread
adjacencies (including chocolate spreads), as well as plant-based dips, to appeal to higher income and
health-conscious millennial demographics, also forms a central part of FFG’s strategy and is supported
by underlying consumer consciousness of the benefits of a plant-based diet. FFG also intends to
accelerate the DCA offering, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, emphasizing the advantages
of these products over traditional dairy cream, including longer shelf life, lower cost of production,
resistance to curdling, greater stability in whipping, the potential to be allergen free, as well as other
health benefits. In addition to the expansion of FFG’s current ranges, there are opportunities in high fat
variants, ambient products and vegan products.

Target countries for adjacencies are large, growing and profitable with an easy-to-penetrate
competitive landscape and positive consumer and retailer trends. A good example is non-dairy milk,
which has been growing at around 11% per annum between 2014 and 2017 and is expected to
continue growing at a strong pace due to underlying positive demand dynamics (consumers
increasingly viewing non-dairy as a more “mainstream” proposition). Chilled dips and other adjacent
categories have demonstrated similar strong growth potential. Due to its research and development
capabilities, FFG is well positioned to take advantage of consumer appetite for alternative products in
the packaged food and non-dairy space.

To tap into the adjacencies segments, FFG will both leverage its existing brand portfolio and develop
new brands. For example, Flora Pro Activ is already seen as a functional health-focused brand, which
offers significant brand expansion opportunities—the brand is already present in the Netherlands in the
non-dairy yogurt adjacent category, hence this provides a platform for growth. Other brands such as
Brummel and Brown are active in products based on dairy yogurt, hence expanding into non-dairy
yogurts, creams and drinks would also be achievable.

**Products**

FFG’s principal products are Plant-Based Spreads, complemented by dairy cream alternatives, Liquids
and other associated products. These products are marketed under a family of historic and iconic
brands with strong recognition in their target markets.

**_Brands_**

FFG has a portfolio of over 100 brands distributed in 69 developed and emerging markets in a variety
of formats, covering a full range of price points across these markets. FFG’s principal spreads brands
include I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter! and Country Crock in the United States, Flora and ProActiv in
the United Kingdom, Becel and Blue Band in the Netherlands, Rama and Lätta in Germany and Blue
Band in Indonesia. FFG’s principal DCA brands include Elmlea in the United Kingdom and Rama in
Germany. In the year ended December 31, 2017, 44 of those brands held the number one position in
their principal markets. FFG’s top seven brands each generated at least €175 million of turnover in the
year ended December 31, 2017 (including turnover associated with adjacent non-spreads products
marketed under those brand names), representing over 59% of FFG’s total turnover during 2017.

**_Spreads_**

FFG is the world’s leading producer of Plant-Based Spreads, including margarine and mélanges.
Margarine and other spreads, like butter, consist of a water-in-fat emulsion, with droplets of water
dispersed uniformly throughout a stable crystalline fat phase. FFG’s spreads are primarily made of
plant and seed oils, water, salt and protein and, in most of FFG’s markets, is the principal product
alternative to butter. Mélanges, which have been increasing in popularity, are Plant-Based Spreads
with butter added for improved taste or texture perception. Plant-Based Spreads have a number of
health and environmental advantages over butter, including higher Omega 3 and 6 fatty acid
concentrations and lower trans- and saturated fat content. Plant-Based Spreads also have a
production lifecycle which requires fewer resources and a lower overall carbon footprint than that of
butter and comparable dairy products. These spreads can be used in a variety of cooking, baking and
spreading applications.

FFG’s Plant-Based Spreads cover a wide range of formats, including chilled products, ambient
products which are solid at room temperature, and tropical ambient products which remain solid at the

124


-----

higher temperatures typically experienced in tropical climates. They come in a number of formats and
can be used for a variety of occasions, including wrappers and tubs for spreading, cooking and baking,
sachets for spreading, liquid products for cooking and baking, and large format tubs, bottles and
portion packs for the foodservice industry.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s turnover attributable to spreads products was
€2,418.6 million, amounting to 83% of FFG’s total turnover during 2017. In the year ended
December 31, 2017, Developed and Emerging Markets accounted for 77% and 23%, respectively, of
FFG’s turnover attributable to spreads products.

**_DCA_**

Dairy cream alternatives (“DCA”) are fully or partially plant-based alternatives to traditional dairy
creams and can be used in the same way for cooking, baking, whipping and topping. These products
are typically made by emulsifying a combination of buttermilk and vegetable oils, although dairy-free
and vegan formulas are available as well. Dairy cream alternatives have a number of advantages over
traditional dairy cream, including longer shelf life, lower cost of production, resistance to curdling,
greater stability in whipping, the potential to be allergen free, as well as other health benefits.

FFG’s DCA portfolio includes cooking creams, whipping creams, sour creams and spreads. These
products are made from both vegetable fats and buttermilk, which have cost and health advantages
over traditional dairy creams. DCA products are packaged in a variety of formats including pots,
bottles, pouches and tetra packs for both the retail and foodservice channels.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s turnover attributable to DCA products was
€189.9 million, amounting to 7% of FFG’s total turnover during 2017. In the year ended December 31,
2017, Developed and Emerging markets accounted for 97% and 3%, respectively, of FFG’s turnover
attributable to DCA products. Germany and the United Kingdom were the largest markets for DCA
products, with Germany accounting for 24% of FFG’s turnover attributable to DCA products and the
United Kingdom accounting for 22% of FFG’s turnover attributable to DCA products.

**_Other products_**

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s turnover attributable to other product categories was
€296.5 million, amounting to 10% of FFG’s total turnover during 2017. The largest of these product
categories was liquids, including liquid margarine and vegetable oils, with turnover of €173 million in
the year ended December 31, 2017. Other categories include olive oil (€31 million), white fats
(€24 million), industrial margarine (€17 million) and cream cheese (€16 million) (in each case for the
year ended December 31, 2017). In the year ended December 31, 2017, Developed and Emerging
Markets accounted for 88% and 12%, respectively, of FFG’s turnover attributable to other products.

As part of our growth strategy, we are targeting expansion into adjacent product categories including
non-dairy milk, sweet spreads and other vegetable-based spreads.

**Markets**

In the developed and emerging markets in which it operates, FFG sells its products primarily through
retail channels, such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, convenience stores and other outlets, with
foodservice channels, such as workplace and educational canteens, cafes and restaurants
representing 9% of FFG’s total turnover in the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Developed Markets_**

Developed Markets, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Russia, accounted
for more than half of the global B&M market, and FFG was present in 30 Developed Markets in 2017.
In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s operations in Developed Markets accounted for
€2,302 million in turnover, representing 79% of FFG’s total turnover. Of FFG’s turnover attributable to
Developed Markets during 2017, the United States accounted for 20%, Germany accounted for 13%,
the United Kingdom accounted for 9%, the Netherlands accounted for 8% and Canada accounted for
5%.

125


-----

_Retail_

FFG’s retail operations in Developed Markets accounted for €2,004 million in turnover, representing
87% of FFG’s turnover attributable to Developed Markets and 69% of its total turnover in the year
ended December 31, 2017. These operations are underpinned by FFG’s strong brand portfolio and
longstanding relationships with leading retailers across its Developed Markets.

FFG is the market leader in retail spreads sales volume in 22 of the 28 Developed Markets in which it
operates, including the United States, Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Canada (based on
FFG data and data for retail market volumes of margarine sourced from Euromonitor International and
Nielsen). Those five countries together accounted for 62% of FFG’s turnover from retail Plant-Based
Spreads sales in all Developed Markets in the year ended December 31, 2017.

These leading positions in key Developed Markets are supported by FFG’s high degrees of brand
awareness and strong relationships with large and well-known retailers. At various points in time in
2016 and 2017, Country Crock, Rama, Flora and Blue Band scored the highest among B&M brands in
the United States, Germany, United Kingdom and Netherlands, respectively, according to Millward
Brown. In addition, FFG distributes its products directly to some of the world’s largest retailers,
including Walmart, Lidl, Rewe, Tesco, Kroger, Carrefour, Jumbo, Superunie, Ahold and Edeka, which
FFG believes strengthens its brand awareness and market positioning. The top ten retailers of FFG
products in developed markets account for 46% of all of FFG’s retail sales, with most of these
relationships spanning over a decade. Even before the separation, FFG has been strategically
repositioning its brands. This is shown in the evolution of the Becel Spreading brand in the
Netherlands. In the first quarter of 2017, Becel Spreading was re-launched in the Netherlands market
to emphasize its plant-based origins. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2017, Becel Spreading in
the Netherlands had a USG decline of -1.7% compared to the prior twelve months. Following the relaunch, in the six months ended September 30, 2017, Becel Spreading in the Netherlands had a USG
increase of 1.4%, compared to the same period in the prior year. Similarly, new initiatives have recently
been launched which have enhanced taste and emphasized the plant-based nature of the Rama brand
in Germany and the Country Crock brand in the U.S, and both brands have subsequently had
improved USG. In the three months ended December 31, 2016, Rama’s USG declined by -15.7%. In
the three months ended June 30, 2017, the USG decline of Rama in Germany had slowed to -5.2%,
and by the three months ended December 31, 2017, USG increased by 13.0% compared to the same
period in the prior year. For Country Crock in the U.S., in the three months ended December 31, 2016,
USG declined by -7.9%. In the three months ended June 30, 2017, the USG decline of Country Crock
had slowed to -3.2%, and by the three months ended December 31, 2017, USG declined slowed still
further to -2.3% compared to the same period in the prior year.

After the separation from Unilever, FFG will provide a dedicated sales force post-distribution and
operate as the supplier of choice and/or “category captain” for certain strategic retailers, providing
in-depth knowledge and consumer insight for particular product categories to its retailer customers. As
is typical in the food industry, FFG does not have long-term contractual commitments with its key
customers. Instead, FFG enters into bespoke joint business plans with customers, which are typically
renewed on an annual basis, and cover prices charged by FFG to its customers, discounts and other
investments. In some markets the level of investment is included in these joint business plans while in
other countries promotions are more flexible and vary during the year. Consequently, FFG generally
does not have fixed-duration, long-term contracts with its retailers, instead taking a flexible approach to
product distribution that harnesses its research and development capabilities and is responsive to
specific retailer needs and other market opportunities. FFG has also developed relationships with
various online retailers and e-commerce platforms, such as Ocado, Tesco and Carrefour online, which
have seen an increase in retail market share in recent years and which we believe represent a
significant growth opportunity in the developed markets in which we operate.

Although end consumers of FFG products in developed markets generally comprise families and
higher income individuals from the “Generation X” and “Millennial” demographics, who tend to be more
health-conscious in their dietary choices, FFG’s offering spans the entire price spectrum from value to
premium. In its main markets, FFG maintains brands with distinct value propositions spanning family
nutrition, heart health, cholesterol improving, superior taste, cooking & baking, and value champion.
A key element of our strategy going forward is to expand upon and strengthen our coverage of the
price spectrum and enhance our appeal to distinct niches and functional needs in each market in which
we operate by repositioning existing brands, and launching new offerings, as needed.

_Foodservice_

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s foodservice operations in Developed Markets accounted
for €298.4 million in turnover, representing 12% of FFG’s turnover attributable to Developed Markets
and 10% of its total turnover.

In 2017, FFG’s foodservice operations had a turnover of greater than €1 million in 23 Developed
Markets and a small but growing market share in the social and commercial foodservice segment.
FFG’s current foodservice customers include Aramark, Sodexo and Hilton. We believe that we can
build on our current foodservice capabilities, including by expanding into the artisanal and industrial
foodservice segments, due to the steady growth in out-of-home dining in recent years and the
demonstrable advantages of Plant-Based Spreads products over butter in large-scale cooking and
baking.

**_Emerging markets_**

FFG’s Emerging Markets include numerous countries in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and
Asia. FFG is present in 16 markets in Latin America, 16 markets in Africa and the Middle East and nine
markets in Asia. In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG’s operations in Emerging Markets
accounted for €602.9 million in turnover, representing 21% of FFG’s total turnover. Of FFG’s turnover
attributable to Emerging Markets during 2017, Latin America accounted for 45%, Africa and the Middle
East accounted for 29% and Asia accounted for 26%.

_Retail_

FFG’s retail operations in Emerging Markets accounted for €533 million in turnover, representing 88%
of FFG’s turnover attributable to Emerging Markets and 18% of its total turnover in the year ended
December 31, 2017. FFG maintains a network of distributors with direct relationships with key retailers
in emerging markets, including Alfamart, Indomaret, Metro, Matahari, Ahold Delhaize and SHV. FFG
brands hold the number one position in seven of its Latin American markets and 11 of its markets in
Africa and the Middle East. End consumers of FFG’s products in emerging markets typically comprise
middle class families. There is considerable upside potential in Emerging Markets arising from per
capita levels of consumption, which are considerably lower than in Developed Markets, as well as
household penetration of B&M products, which in some Emerging Markets is considerably lower than
in Developed Markets. There is also opportunity in expanding into countries in which FFG does not
currently operate.

_Foodservice_

FFG’s foodservice operations in Emerging Markets accounted for €70 million in turnover, representing
12% of FFG’s turnover attributable to Emerging Markets and 2% of its total turnover in the year ended
December 31, 2017.

In 2017, FFG’s foodservice operations had a turnover of greater than €1 million in nine Emerging
Markets. We believe that there is a significant opportunity in foodservice in our emerging markets,
particularly in Latin America, where industrial baking is widespread given low levels of oven penetration
among consumers.

**Sales and Marketing**

FFG aims to solidify and enhance its market-leading brand awareness by leveraging its products’
strong emotional cues that resonate with end consumers with respect to family nutrition, heart health,
taste, cooking and baking, and value. FFG’s sales and marketing operations seek to accomplish this
through its advertising, promotional and point of sale functions.

FFG’s advertising function works with global and local media agencies, such as Mindshare, Initiative
and Omnicom, to execute its media strategy through local specialists at the country or business unit
level. The purchase and management of media at the local level enables FFG’s advertising to
accommodate to each of the various markets in which it operates. This includes, for example,
promotional campaigns to capitalize on baking occasions for major holidays, such as Christmas and
Easter in North America, Latin America and Europe, and Ramadan in Asia and the Middle East. FFG’s
promotional function manages the creation and distribution of promotional packs and samples,
partnership programs, in-store displays and other communication materials, and its point of sale
function manages FFG’s relationships with retailers and the coordination of point of sale materials. In
particular, as part of its point of sale function, FFG provides certain retailers with a dedicated sales
force that assists the retailer with the stocking and in-store marketing of the relevant FFG products in

127


-----

order to increase traffic and sales. In emerging markets, FFG’s point of sale function maintains
relationships with traditional retail channels, such as small-scale shops and street vendors, as well as
modern retail channels including supermarkets and hypermarkets.

**Competition**

While there are other local and regional produces of Plant-Based spreads, FFG is the largest global
producer of Plant-Based Spreads by a large margin. See “Industry.” FFG’s Plant-Based Spreads also
face competition from alternative products such as butter, cooking oils, cream cheese and sweet
spreads. Principal competitors to FFG’s DCA products are traditional dairy creams. The competitive
dynamics in FFG’s industry are also driven by changes in dietary and taste trends. In particular, the
decline in consumption of bread in developed markets over the past decade has presented a
competitive challenge for FFG and others in its industry.

**Research and Development**

FFG has an industry leading research and development function that underpins its ability to produce
new and innovative products using technically sophisticated equipment and processes across its
product lines and markets. FFG’s research and development platform has eight principal capabilities:

    - Chefmanship—The research and development platform incorporates insight into real world
cooking practices with ongoing feedback from food professionals to remain on culinary trend
and provide optimal taste and functionality for each market, with these metrics being
continually reviewed and improved upon.

    - Consumer technical insight—The research and development platform seeks to translate
consumer expectations into technical requirements, enabling product and packaging design to
be optimized. This includes capitalizing on FFG’s in-house, world-leading flavor development
resource, in depth know-how of melting behavior and flavor release and advanced flavor
mapping in key markets to give insights to maximize market share. For example, we are
developing the only spreads product with Omega 3 and 6 to be stable in tropical conditions.

    - Digital—The research and development platform uses digital tools to capture ingredient and
process knowledge, supporting the delivery of product development through precision
modelling. The ready access to these resources via FFG’s digital tools gives it the ability to
launch new on-trend products within three to six months. Digital modelling also supports cost
efficient product development, with functions like the ability to digitally predict structure and
melting of recipes allowing new product innovation to be accelerated with minimal associated
costs.

    - Nutrition—The strength of FFG’s brands is supported by its ability to translate nutrition
science into product claims, communications and endorsements. Its portfolio of cholesterol
lowering spreads have been at the forefront of the development of products with
demonstrable health benefits that do not compromise on taste.

    - Flavors—Taste is the primary criterion that drives the purchase of FFG’s products. Its
research and development platform has invested heavily in developing proprietary flavors that
enhance consumer experience and allow FFG’s products to achieve parity with butter.

    - Packaging development—In addition to the products themselves, the design of attractive and
robust packaging that is easy to produce and convenient to transport and use contributes to
the success of FFG’s business.

    - Regulatory—Food safety is a paramount issue in FFG’s business. A key part of the research
and development function is ensuring that FFG’s products are fully compliant with local
requirements. This is accomplished through strong and ongoing engagement with
governments, regulators and other opinion formers with impact on diet and health guidelines.

    - Technological capabilities—FFG’s pioneering technologies, many of which are proprietary,
together with deep institutional knowledge of the production process have made it a leader in
the industry. For example, FFG’s fast blending process is a new simpler and safer production
process capable of delivering a wide range of products for both emerging and developed
markets. It can be implemented in a modular production set up requiring lower capital
expenditure than traditional production methods and enabling fast capacity expansion for

128


-----

emerging markets. FFG has over 75 patents for industry-leading manufacturing processes
and other proprietary technology.

These capabilities will be supported by strategically located facilities worldwide. The global research
and development center will be located in Rotterdam, with smaller regional research facilities in New
Jersey, Mexico and Indonesia. In addition, there will be 16 local research and development teams in
close proximity to the diverse markets served by FFG, allowing for the development of differentiated
products optimized for local conditions.

**Procurement**

The primary raw materials used in the production of FFG’s products are commodities, primarily
comprising liquid oils and tropical oils, such as rapeseed, soybean, palm and sunflower oil, as well as
blended oils, water and cardboard and plastic packaging materials. With the exception of palm oil, FFG
sources most of its food ingredients and packaging materials directly from local suppliers, and its
supply chain is aligned with its geographic footprint, enabling it to optimize its supply arrangements and
minimise distribution costs. FFG operates a centralized procurement function designed to leverage its
purchasing expertise and maximize scale efficiencies across both developed and emerging markets.
FFG’s procurement function has a deep understanding of commodity cycles and risk management,
and many years of experience in the oils market. To optimize pricing, FFG uses its blend flex process
to identify and purchase the cheapest oil blends on the market based on dynamic price analysis in
order to manufacture its products to consistent standards of taste and quality. FFG’s risk management
mechanisms include the use of physical stocks, contracts, derivatives and other financial hedging
transactions to insulate the business from short term price volatility across a majority of its input
commodities, with initiatives underway to expand the scope of such measures to cover packaging
material costs as well. Because many commodity prices worldwide are set in U.S. dollars, while FFG’s
turnover is generated in the local currencies in the markets in which it operates, a layered hedging
approach of up to 12 months duration is used to hedge this foreign currency transaction exposure.

FFG has developed strong, long-standing relationships with its major suppliers of key raw materials,
many of which have been in place for over a decade. FFG also benefits from favorable payment terms
with a large number of suppliers enabling advantageous working capital management. To some extent,
these favorable payment terms may be attributable to the supplier finance program sponsored by
Unilever, which allows suppliers to factor their FFG receivables at selected banks at rates these
suppliers find attractive and serves as an inducement to make payment terms more favorable than
they otherwise would be. In the event this program ends after the separation from Unilever, our
payment terms with participating suppliers may become less favorable; however, management
believes that the standard market terms to which such suppliers might revert in the commodity markets
in which FFG purchases its key inputs are more than sufficient to allow FFG to maintain a strong
structural net negative working capital position. Key suppliers of commodities include
ArcherDanielsMidland, Wilmar, C Thywissen, Bunge, Sime Darby, Cargill and Olenex. Key suppliers of
packaging include Amcor, RPC and Smurfit Kappa.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG spent €812.3 million on raw materials and €281.7 million
on packaging materials, representing 45% and 15%, respectively, of FFG’s total supply chain costs.

**Manufacturing**

After the separation from Unilever, FFG will own and operate a total of 17 production facilities,
comprising ten factories in developed markets and seven factories in emerging markets. These
facilities, together with certain equipment that is being moved to FFG from facilities still owned by
Unilever, produced approximately 1,311 kilotons of product in the year ended December 31, 2016
representing approximately 88% of FFG’s total production volume. FFG will also have co-packing
arrangements in place at eight further facilities that will remain owned by Unilever, these facilities
produced 3% of FFG total production volume in the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, FFG
has strategic relationships with numerous third party manufacturers, which produced approximately
128 kilotons of product in the year ended December 31, 2016, representing approximately 9% of FFG’s
total production volume. FFG believes that its global network of production facilities provides it with
exceptional outreach to local markets while maintaining quality and efficiency through scale.

Notes:
(1) Output is pro forma the consolidation of lines that are being moved to FFG from certain facilities still owned by Unilever.
(2) Unconstrained utilization rate refers to the volume of production achieved divided by the maximum production volume
possible assuming constant operation.
(3) “Other” includes specific site capabilities, e.g. cream cheese in Sweden, cooking fat in Portugal and olive oil and seed oil in
Greece.
(4) Agbara facility opened in 2017.

FFG’s production facilities are focused on in-house manufacturing of a wide range of FFG’s product
offering along with multiple packaging options. These facilities are equipped with the latest proprietary
technologies, including cool blending and fast blending, and because there is sufficient capacity in the
network to support much larger volumes, FFG’s capital expenditure requirements are relatively small,
even in light of its growth initiatives.

Although capacity differs by product category and facility, as shown in the table above, almost all of
FFG’s facilities have significant spare capacity available to accommodate rapid future growth in all key
product categories, including planned expansion in the private label and foodservice segments, as well
as to respond to seasonal fluctuations. In addition, FFG’s relationships with its third-party
manufacturers provide FFG with added manufacturing flexibility, and also allow it to speed up
innovation delivery and enter adjacent product categories with minimal investment.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG spent €537.6 million on production costs, excluding raw
materials and packaging costs, which represented 30% of FFG’s total supply chain costs.

**Distribution**

FFG operates an asset-light distribution model that carefully manages its outbound supply chain and
allocates products manufactured in its production facilities to its distribution centres (primary
distribution) and subsequently to its retailers and foodservice customers (secondary distribution). In
addition, FFG’s distribution network is well-consolidated and aligned with its manufacturing footprint in
the markets in which it operates. In the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 79% of its
distribution centres (measured by costs) and all of its transport fleet were outsourced to third parties.
FFG believes that this heavily-outsourced distribution model allows it to minimise costs and maintain
operational flexibility.

In the year ended December 31, 2017, FFG spent €191.4 million on distribution costs, which
represented 10% of FFG’s total supply chain costs.

130


-----

**Employees**

As at December 31, 2017, FFG’s cost of staff was €155.7 million in Developed Markets and
€70.2 million in Emerging Markets. On a standalone post-separation basis, we expect that FFG will
have approximately 3,500 full-time employees.

**Sustainability**

As part of Unilever, sustainability was at the heart of FFG’s business and it has made substantial
investments to reach some of the industry’s highest levels of sustainable sourcing, and FFG intends to
continue Unilever’s sustainable palm oil practices. FFG’s supply base consists of a select group of
low-risk, high-standard raw material producers. In addition, FFG has invested heavily to improve its
production efficiency, including its levels of energy and water consumption and volumes of waste and
carbon dioxide generated by its production facilities. FFG has also invested to improve its packaging
efficiency, for example moving away from aluminum foil to lighter materials and reducing the lid
thickness.

**Health and safety**

FFG has established environmental, health and safety protocols to support its manufacturing and other
operations. Information relating to compliance with environment, health and safety measures is
collected by responsible employees at each site. Each of FFG’s main production sites has an
employee dedicated to environment, health and safety matters.

**Intellectual property**

Maintaining adequate brand protection is of significant importance to FFG’s business as it relies on its
brands to implement its business strategy. FFG has an extensive trademark portfolio with
approximately 3,900 trademarks (including trademarks to be assigned from Unilever upon completion
of the Acquisition) across all of its markets. FFG also holds over 1,200 patents and design registrations
(including pending patents, and patents and design registrations to be assigned upon completion of the
Acquisition). FFG’s intellectual property is managed centrally, and it works closely with a third party
agency in respect of filings, renewals, recordings and the prosecution and enforcement of intellectual
property matters internationally.

**Insurance**

FFG carries insurance that it believes to be common in its industry and sufficient to cover the principal
risks of damage to its business. FFG maintains, where appropriate, insurance with respect to liability of
our directors and officers, property damage, business interruption, cold storage facilities, public liability,
products liability, product recall, damage to vehicles, personal accident and travel. FFG undertakes
periodic risk reviews to assess whether its insurance is in line with its business risks and whether the
developments in insurance policies are reflective of the changes in its business.

**Litigation**

From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, FFG is subject to litigation. Except as set forth in
this Offering Memorandum, there were no proceedings ongoing, pending or to the knowledge of FFG,
threatened, that would have a material adverse impact on FFG as a whole.

During 2016, one of Unilever’s subsidiaries in Israel became the subject of an application for
certification of a class action claim based on allegations of unfair pricing in the margarine market. The
claim, which has not been certified by the court, would, if so certified, be for approximately €33 million.
Unilever intends to robustly defend this claim and believe that the likelihood that it will ultimately prevail
is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in court. Any liability resulting from this claim
would be the responsibility of Unilver, and Unilever have given an indemnity to Bidco for any fines
resulting from historic claims. Unilever believes its position is strong and so the matter has not been
provided for and is considered to be a contingent liability. Additionally, in March 2018, a Unilever
subsidiary in Greece received a Statement of Objections from the Hellenic Competition Commission for
alleged violations of competition law in the margarine sector from 1996 until today. Unilever is still
assessing the implications from this complex case and is unable to assess the level of any potential
fine. Should the allegations be upheld, the maximum fine which could be levied would be

131


-----

approximately €40 million. Unilever intends to defend these allegations robustly, although there is no
guarantee of success, and therefore the matter has not been provided for and is considered to be a
contingent liability. Finally, in 2015 a class action lawsuit was filed against one of Unilever’s
subsidiaries in California based on allegations of deceptive labelling and marketing of the “I Can’t
Believe It’s Not Butter!” brand. The case had been stayed since 2015 pending rulings in another
appellate matter, but the stay was lifted in 2017 and class certification discovery is now ongoing.
A decision on class certification is expected in 2019. Unilever intends to robustly defend this claim and
has not reserved any amounts in connection with this litigation. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_FFG’s Business and Industry—Potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect FFG’s_
_business.”_

**Transitional Service Arrangements with Unilever**

We have a number of transitional service arrangements in place with Unilever to help ensure business
continuity during the separation process. These arrangements cover marketing, distribution, IT, shared
services, human resources, workplace and travel services, research and development and logistics.
Their terms range from six to 18 months, with early termination rights on a regional basis upon
advance written notice. The TSAs are an essential part of the implementation of our strategy, allowing
us to construct business infrastructure that is appropriate to our needs as a stand-alone business
without disrupting our operations during the separation process. We are responsible for the
development and implementation of migration plans to transition from the TSAs to stand-alone
business functions or alternative third party suppliers. The services provided pursuant to the TSAs are
bespoke and, in some cases, interdependent.

The TSAs cover marketing services, including handling consumer concerns, enquiries and complaints
via telephone and email in accordance with current Unilever practices including social media enquiries,
providing monthly reports summarising all claims and enquiries and managing consumer complaints,
as well as providing media buying, media activation and website maintenance. This arrangement will
remain in place for 12 months from separation for annual consideration of €1.7 million.

The TSAs cover distribution services, including providing sales, marketing and distribution support in
countries being transferred from the Unilever distribution model to our new distributor model. Pursuant
to these arrangements, Unilever will conduct all brand and marketing investment and local country
activities. This arrangement will remain in place for 12 months from separation for annual consideration
of €9.8 million.

The TSAs cover IT services, including application support and maintenance provided in relation to
global and regional applications (e.g. SAP, main packages, licenses including maintenance and IT
service desk); application development provided in relation to global and regional initiated projects and
pre-planned changes; maintenance of IT systems, including system operation and maintenance of
hardware, servers and global networks, current incident management and problem management
processes; end-user computing environments, including all global and regional infrastructure, such as
certified PCs, mobile devices and licenses which will be managed and supported by Unilever, including
replacement of equipment and performance of support maintenance; email and collaboration services
using our own domain; network connectivity services and managed security services; and call out
separation support to enable us to establish our own stand-alone IT environment. These arrangements
have terms of 12 months from the date of separation with respect to Europe, and 18 months from the
date of separation with respect to North America and the rest of the world. Annual consideration for
these services will be €31.2 million for Europe, and €18.7 million with respect to North America and the
rest of the world.

The TSAs cover shared service support for key transactional processes. Order to cash services
include accepting orders from customers and ensure they are correctly entered into the system,
invoicing customers and collecting and processing receivables from customers, credit management
including using credit terms and limits, monitoring available customer credit and taking appropriate
preventative and corrective actions as well as maintaining sales history records with customers.
Purchase to pay services include credit management and the maintenance of purchase history with
suppliers. Record to report services include the recording of all financial data within the enterprise
resource planning system, the maintenance of accurate ledgers and the provision of timely and
accurate financial data to facilitate reporting and performance management. The shared services TSA

also includes master data management. Unilever will also include management and financial reporting
information based on its internal reporting calendar, accounting policies, operating framework and
existing business practices. It will also perform general accounting functions, including processing
journal entries, allocations and period end adjustments, analysis and reconciliation of general ledger
accounts, preparation and posting of management adjustments as well as recording standard product
cost accounting. The shared services TSAs have terms of 12 months from the date of separation with
respect to Europe, and 18 months from the date of separation with respect to North America and the
rest of the world. Annual consideration for these services will be €2.9 million for Europe, and
€3.3 million with respect to North America and the rest of the world.

The TSAs cover payroll services and workplace and travel services, including access to offices and
research and development facilities. These services have a term of six months from the date of
separation and an annual cost of €13.3 million.

The TSAs also cover logistics, including warehousing services in locations where warehouses are
currently operated by Unilever. These services have a term of 12 months from the date of separation
and an annual cost of €9.0 million.

**Senior Management of FFG**

**_Executive Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Management Transition_**

On April 11, 2018, KKR announced that it intends to appoint David Haines as Executive Chairman of
the Global Spreads Business, subject to and effective from the successful completion of the
Acquisition.

Mr Haines was previously Chairman and CEO of Grohe Group, and subsequently CEO of Lixil Water
Technology Group. At Grohe, Mr. Haines led the complete transformation of the business over a 10

number of roles in Europe, Asia and North America. Mr. Andersen holds a Masters Degree in
Economics and Business Administration from Aarhus school of Business in Denmark. We intend that
our current group CFO, Javier Tena, will continue with FFG in a senior finance role working with Mr.
Andersen, although this has not yet been finalized.

Separately, Nicolas Liabeuf, the Chief Executive Officer of FFG, has informed us that he intends to
step down as CEO after the completion of the Acquisition. It is anticipated that Mr Liabeuf will assist
Mr Haines in assuming leadership of FFG, and remain engaged for a period after completion of the
Acquisition to assist in a smooth transition.

to commence a search for a suitably qualified replacement.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Material Agreements Between Bidco and Unilever**

Bidco will enter into the Acquisition Agreement and a number of other agreements with Unilever for the
purpose of accomplishing the Acquisition by Bidco of the FFG business described in this Offering
Memorandum and of establishing the terms of Unilever’s other relationships with Bidco. These
agreements will govern the relationship between Unilever and Bidco subsequent to FFG’s separation
from Unilever.

**_Acquisition Agreement_**

On December 15, 2017, Bidco issued the Offer Letter to Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC providing for
the Acquisition. The Offer Letter will remain irrevocable and open for acceptance until the earlier of
(i) June 15, 2018 (or such date, up to September 15, 2018, as agreed between Bidco and Unilever
N.V. and Unilever PLC); and (ii) the date 5 business days after completion of certain works council
consultation processes (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). Once the final, binding, irrevocable
and fully financed offer has been accepted by Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC, the parties will then
execute the Acquisition Agreement.

The Acquisition Agreement sets forth the agreements between Bidco, Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC
with respect to the principal corporate transactions required to consummate the Acquisition and a
number of other agreements governing Bidco’s relationship with Unilever following the Acquisition.

Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement and local transfer documents, Bidco will agree to
acquire all of the issued and outstanding share capital of the entities comprising FFG and the
acquisition of certain assets (and the assumption of related liabilities) associated with FFG’s business.
Bidco will be transferred intellectual property related to FFG and certain intellectual property will be
licenced back to Unilever for non-FFG use, as well as acquiring designated personnel, plant and
equipment and other rights, properties and assets of the FFG business, and certain facilities, services
and contractual rights to carry on the business of FFG after completion in the places and substantially
in the manner in which it is carried on as at the Completion Date. Bidco will assume the liabilities
primarily relating to, arising out of or resulting from the FFG business, subject to certain exceptions.

Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the purchase price payable for the FFG business will be
€6,825 million, subject to customary completion accounts adjustments and payments in respect of
cash balances, intra-group financing receivables, third party indebtedness, intra-group financing
payables and working capital. We will only consummate the Acquisition if specified conditions are
satisfied, including the receipt of certain required anti-trust approvals. Even if these conditions are
satisfied, other events or circumstances could occur that could impact the timing of or terms of the
separation or our ability or plans to consummate the Acquisition.

The Acquisition Agreement contains representations and warranties of Unilever N.V., Unilever PLC
and Bidco, and covenants and other agreements between Unilever N.V., Unilever PLC and Bidco.

The Acquisition Agreement provides for indemnification for losses relating to specified events,
circumstances and matters. Subject to specified limitations, Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC will agree
to indemnify Bidco from certain liabilities from specific matters, including any losses arising from any
liabilities that should not be transferred to by Bidco pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement.

Subject to specified limitations, Bidco will also be required to indemnify Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC
following the consummation of the Acquisition from certain liabilities arising from specified matters,
including the liabilities Bidco should have assumed pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions, Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC have also agreed not to compete with
the FFG business for a period of three years from the Completion Date.

FFG may engage in delayed closings with respect to assets or employees in certain foreign countries
in which the necessary regulatory and other approvals cannot be obtained at the time of the
consummation of the Acquisition.

139


-----

**_Transition Services_**

We have a number of transitional service arrangements in place with Unilever to help ensure business
continuity during the separation process. These arrangements cover marketing, distribution, IT, shared
services, human resources, workplace and travel services, research and development and logistics.
See “Business—Transitional Service Arrangements with Unilever.”

**_Related Agreements_**

In addition to the Acquisition Agreement, on or prior to the Completion Date, Unilever N.V., Unilever
PLC and Bidco will enter into agreements governing certain relationships between and among them
after the consummation of the Acquisition. It is currently contemplated that these agreements will
include long term agreements, reverse long term agreements, co-packing and reverse co-packing
agreements, local asset transfer agreements, real estate leases and related agreements, transferred
business intellectual property rights agreements, license agreements, assignment and other such
agreements as may reasonably be required to effect the purchase of the FFG business.

**Agreements Between Bidco and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P.**

It is expected that Bidco will enter into a transaction fee agreement with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
L.P. (the “Manager”) in which Bidco agrees to pay a transaction fee for the services rendered by the
Manager in connection with the Acquisition. Bidco may also engage the Manager under the transaction
fee agreement should Bidco require additional financial advisory or consulting services. It is also
expected that Bidco will enter into a monitoring services and fee agreement with the Manager in which
the Manager will provide management, consulting and financial services to Bidco and its direct and
indirect divisions, subsidiaries, parent entities and controlled affiliates and Bidco agrees to pay a
management fee for such services.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

The following is a summary of certain provisions of our indebtedness and certain financial
arrangements to which the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries are or will be a party. It does not
purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying
documents.

**Senior Credit Facilities Agreement**

**_Definitions_**

The following capitalized terms are used in this summary of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement
have the meaning given to them below:

“Allocation Date” means the date on which final allocations in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities (as
defined below) are formally notified to syndicate members and free to trade in accordance with the
syndication strategy as agreed in writing between the arrangers under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement (as defined below) and the Company.

“Company” means the Issuer.

“Group” means the Issuer and each of its subsidiaries from time to time, but excluding certain
unrestricted subsidiaries (if any).

**_Overview and Structure_**

On January 24, 2018, the Company, Sigma Midco B.V. (“Midco”), Sigma Bidco B.V. (“Bidco”) and
Sigma US Corp (“US Bidco”) entered into a senior facilities agreement with, among others, Credit
Suisse International as facility agent (the “Senior Facility Agent”) and Security Agent as amended and/
or restated from time to time including by an amendment and restatement agreement dated 23 March
2018 (the “Senior Credit Facilities Agreement”).

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement provides for:

(a) term loan B facilities of approximately €3.95 billion in aggregate which are comprised of:

i. a term loan B1 facility of €2 billion (“Senior Term Facility B1”);

ii. a term loan B2 facility of US$875 million (“Senior Term Facility B2”)

iii. a term loan B3 facility of €475 million which is intended to be redenominated into Polish Złoty
on the date of drawdown (“Senior Term Facility B3”); and

iv. a term loan B4 facility of an amount equal to the aggregate of £445 million and €300 million
(which will be redenominated into pound sterling on the date of drawdown) (“Senior Term
Facility B4”); and

(b) a revolving credit facility of €700 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

Senior Term Facility B1, Senior Term Facility B2, Senior Term Facility B3 and Senior Term Facility B4
together, the “Senior Term Facilities” and each a “Senior Term Facility”. The Senior Term Facilities
together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Senior Credit Facilities”.

The Senior Term Facilities may be used for financing or refinancing any amounts payable under or in
connection with the Acquisition, refinancing, purchasing or otherwise discharging any indebtedness of
the Group (together with any breakage costs, redemption premium and other costs, fees and expenses
incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing or discharge) and financing any costs
(including all fees, costs and expenses and stamp, transfer, registration, notarial and other taxes)
incurred in connection with the Acquisition.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by any current or future borrower under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement in euros, pounds sterling, U.S. dollars or any other readily available or agreed
currency by the drawing of cash advances or the issue of letters of credit or ancillary facilities. The

141


-----

Revolving Credit Facility may be used for financing or refinancing the working capital requirements of
the Group and/or for general corporate purposes of the Group (including for any acquisitions or capital
expenditure) and/or to provide cash collateral or other credit support for existing ancillary facilities and
financing costs relating to such cash collateral, other credit support or the existing ancillary facilities.

In addition, the Company may elect to request additional facilities either as a new facility or as
additional tranches of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Additional Facilities”). The Company
and the lenders in respect of the Additional Facilities may agree to certain terms in relation to the
Additional Facilities, including the margin, the termination date (each subject to parameters as set out
in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement) and the availability period thereof. Subject to the parameters
set out in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, unless the indebtedness incurred is otherwise
permitted under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the maximum aggregate principal amount of
the indebtedness outstanding under all Additional Facilities (after taking into account the application of
proceeds of any relevant indebtedness) may not at any time exceed the aggregate of:

(a) the greater of:

i. €750,000,000; and

ii. 100% of (i) consolidated EBITDA as stated in the most recently delivered compliance
certificate or (ii) if no compliance certificate has yet been delivered under the Senior Credit
Facilities Agreement, consolidated EBITDA as determined by the Company for the most
recently ended relevant period for which the Company has sufficient available information so
as to be able to determine consolidated EBITDA; plus

(b) the maximum amount such that the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined below) at the end
of the most recently completed relevant period is not greater than 5.00:1.00 calculated on a pro
_forma basis._

The Senior Term Facilities mature on the date falling 84 months after first utilization of the Senior Term
Facilities.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized until a month before the maturity date, and matures on
the date falling 78 months after first utilization of the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Senior Credit Facilities will initially bear interest at the following rates per annum:

(a) in relation to loans under the Senior Term Facility B1, the aggregate of 3.50% and EURIBOR;

(b) in relation to loans under the Senior Term Facility B2, the aggregate of 3.00% and LIBOR;

(c) in relation to loans under the Senior Term Facility B3, the aggregate of 3.50% and WIBOR;

(e) in relation to loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the aggregate of 3.00% and LIBOR,
EURIBOR and/or WIBOR (as applicable).

After the date falling six (6) months after the Senior Credit Facilities are first utilized, the margin for
each loan under the Senior Credit Facilities will be subject to adjustment by reference to the Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined below) as shown in the quarterly financial statements or, as the
case may be, the annual financial statements for that relevant period and the related compliance
certificate, to equal the rate per annum set out in the following table:

142


-----

The margin on any loans under an Additional Facility will be agreed between the Company and the
relevant lenders.

If EURIBOR, LIBOR or WIBOR (as applicable) is less than zero, EURIBOR, LIBOR or WIBOR (as
applicable) shall be deemed to be zero in respect of any loan under the Senior Credit Facilities.

Commitment fees are payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Revolving
Credit Facility for the relevant periods set out in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement at a rate of 30%
of the applicable Margin of the relevant Revolving Credit Facility (the “ RCF Commitment Fee”).
Generally, the RCF Commitment Fee is payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of availability of
the relevant Revolving Credit Facility and if cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the relevant lender’s
commitment under the relevant Revolving Credit Facility at the time such cancellation is effective.

Commitment fees are also payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of Senior Term
Facility B1, Senior Term Facility B2 and Senior Term Facility B4 at the following rate:

(a) from the date falling 46 days after the Allocation Date until the date falling 90 days after the
Allocation Date, 50% of the applicable Margin on Senior Term Facility B1, Senior Term Facility B2
or, as the case may be, Senior Term Facility B4 from time to time; and

(b) from the date falling 91 days after the Allocation Date, 100% of the then Margin on Senior Term
Facility B1, Senior Term Facility B2 or, as the case may be, Senior Term Facility B4 from time to
time,

(the “Senior Term Facility Ticking Fee”). The Senior Term Facility Ticking Fee is payable on the date
the relevant Senior Term Facility is first utilized and subsequently payable in arrears, on the last day of
availability of the relevant Senior Term Facility and if cancelled, on the cancelled amount of the
relevant lender’s commitment under the relevant Senior Term Facility at the time such cancellation is
effective.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on the overdue amount.

The Company is also required to pay (or procure the payment of) customary agency and arrangement
fees in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities.

**_Repayments_**

In relation to Senior Term Facility B2 only, 0.25% of the original principal amount of each Senior Term
Facility B2 loan made must be repaid quarterly. All other outstanding amounts under the Senior Term
Facilities are required to be repaid on the date falling 84 months after first utilization of the Senior Term
Facilities.

Loans under each Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to a netting mechanism against new loans under the Revolving Credit Facility
to be drawn on such date.

The termination date in respect of an Additional Facility will be the date agreed between the Company
and the relevant lenders.

**_Prepayment_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to a minimum
amount and certain conditions).

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement also permits each lender to require the mandatory prepayment
of all amounts due to that lender upon a change of control of the Company or a sale of the whole or
substantially the whole of the business and assets of the Group.

In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires that, in respect of each financial year of the
Company, a mandatory prepayment of loans under the Senior Term Facilities is made in an amount
equal to a percentage of excess cashflow (net of a minimum threshold amount and the amount of any
voluntary prepayments made during such financial year) which percentage decreases as the Group’s
Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined below) decreases.

143


-----

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains a prepayment fee provision whereby lenders in
respect of the Senior Term Facilities will, subject to customary carve-outs and exceptions, benefit from
a prepayment fee of 1% of their participation in the relevant amount of any Senior Term Facility if all or
part of that Senior Term Facility is voluntarily prepaid in connection with a refinancing or repricing, or
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement is amended pursuant to a refinancing or repricing transaction, in
each case, within six months of the first utilization of any Senior Term Facility, the primary purpose of
which is to reduce the effective yield on that Senior Term Facility.

**_Guarantees_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and the Guarantors. The Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement requires that (subject to agreed security principles as set out in the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Agreed Security Principles”)) each member of the Group which:

(a) is incorporated in the Netherlands, Germany, New York, Delaware and England (each a “Security

to include, among other things, any member of the Group that has earnings before interest, tax,

the delivery of the Group’s annual audited consolidated financial statements for the relevant year
showing that such subsidiary is a Material Company such that the guarantors represent at least 80% of
the consolidated EBITDA of the Group (excluding the EBITDA of any member of the Group not
required to become a Guarantor in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles).

In addition, any member of the Target Group which is incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction and is a
Material Company (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) is required to become a guarantor under
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement within 120 days of first utilization of the Senior Credit Facilities
such that the guarantors represent at least 80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Target Group
(excluding the EBITDA of any member of the Group not required to become a Guarantor in accordance
with the Agreed Security Principles).

No member of the Group incorporated in Asia, South America, Africa or Russia shall be required to
provide any guarantee or security interests.

**_Security_**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Guarantors have granted or will grant security interests
on a first priority basis (to the extent legally possible) in favour of the Security Agent over certain assets
as described below:

(a) in the case of each borrower and/or guarantor incorporated in The Netherlands or Germany:

With respect to the Revolving Credit Facility only, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires that
the sum of certain outstanding senior secured net indebtedness of the Group to the consolidated
EBITDA of the Group as at the last day of each relevant period (the “Senior Secured Leverage Ratio”)
shall not be greater than 8.50:1.00.

_provided that:_

(a) this financial covenant is only to be tested if on the last day of the applicable relevant period, the
amount drawn by way of loan under the Revolving Credit Facility is equal to or greater than 40% of
the Revolving Credit Facility; and

(b) with respect to the Senior Term Facilities, failure to satisfy the financial covenant ratio shall not (or
be deemed to) constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or an
event of default.

145


-----

The Company is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the net leverage covenant by applying a
“cure” amount (generally, amounts received by the Company in cash pursuant to any new equity or
permitted subordinated debt) as if consolidated EBITDA had been increased by such amount. There is
no requirement to apply any cure amount in prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities. No more than
two different cure amounts may be taken into account in any financial year and no more than five
different cure amounts may be taken into account prior to the original termination date of the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement contains certain events of default, the occurrence of which
would allow the requisite majority of lenders (under and as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement) to, amongst other actions, accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their
commitments, including, among other events (subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods,
financial thresholds and other qualifications):

    - failure to pay off any amounts when due under the finance documents entered into in
connection with the Senior Credit Facilities;

    - (with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility only) breach of the financial covenant or (with
respect to all Senior Credit Facilities) failure to comply with other obligations under the Senior
Credit Facilities finance documents;

    - inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made (subject to materiality qualifications);

    - cross defaults, including any event of default under the Notes;

    - insolvency, insolvency proceedings and commencement of certain creditors’ processes, such
as expropriation, attachment, sequestration, distress or execution;

    - unlawfulness, invalidity rescission and repudiation, or unenforceability of the finance
documents entered into in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities; and

    - breach of material obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement by any holding company of
the Company.

**_Governing law_**

The Senior Credit Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, Sigma
Holdco B.V. (the “Parent”), Midco, Bidco and US Bidco (together with any other entity which accedes
or otherwise becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a debtor, the “Debtors”) entered into
an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”) dated January 24, 2018, with, among
others, Credit Suisse International as facility agent and security agent. The Trustee will accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Parent Notes Trustee on the Issue Date.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out, among other things, the
relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors, the relative ranking of certain security granted
by the collateral providers, when payments can be made in respect of certain debt of the Debtors,
when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness, the terms pursuant to which
certain of that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions.

The Intercreditor Agreement additionally provides for Hedge Counterparties and Operating Facility
Lenders (each as defined below) to receive guarantees and indemnities from the Debtors on
substantially the same terms (including the relevant limitations) as such guarantees and indemnities
are provided by the obligors to the finance parties under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement.

Agreement, the Parent shall be entitled to require that all or any part of the liabilities in relation to
Hedging Liabilities and/or the Operating Facility Liabilities shall rank in right and priority of payment pari

Subject to the paragraph above and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the Debt Financing
Agreements, any Priority Facility shall rank in right and priority of payment as determined by the
Parent.

_Enforcement: Priority Facility_

The right of the lenders or other creditors in respect of a Priority Facility to:

(a) instruct the Security Agent to enforce the security;

(b) give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
security as they see fit; and/or

(c) otherwise provide instructions as, or as part of, an Instructing Group,

shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favorable to the other Secured
Parties than, those customary for facilities of a similar nature to that Priority Facility (if any), in each
case as at the date such Priority Facility is contractually committed by the relevant member(s) of the
Group and as determined by the Parent (with any such determination to be conclusive).

_Option to Purchase_

(a) The Senior Notes Creditors and the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors shall be provided with
an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility consistent in
all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right provided in relation to the Senior Lender
Liabilities as set out under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities—
_Option to Purchase: Senior Secured Creditors.”_

154


-----

(b) The Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative(s) shall be
provided with an ‘option to purchase’ right in relation to any liabilities in respect of a Priority Facility
consistent in all material respects with the ‘option to purchase’ right as set out under the paragraph
captioned “—Restrictions Relating to Senior Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities—
_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors.”_

_Supplemental Security_

Without prejudice to the provisions set out under the caption “—Ranking and Priority” and
“—Application of Proceeds” and the other rights of the Debtors under the Intercreditor Agreement and
the debt documents, if any member of the Group enters into any hedging agreement or Operating
Facility Document at any time after the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (which is not already
secured by the Original Transaction Security), any Debtor may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, at any time grant to the relevant Hedge Counterparty or, as the case may be, Operating
Facility Lender Supplemental Security securing all or any Hedging Liabilities arising under the relevant
hedging agreement or, as the case may be, all or any Operating Facility Liabilities arising under the
relevant Operating Facility Document. A Debtor may grant Supplemental Security to any secured
creditor in connection with all or any part of any New Debt Financing.

The Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries agree that Supplemental Security may
be granted by any Debtor in order to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities, any Operating
Facility Liabilities and/or any New Debt Financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set out this caption shall:

(a) restrict the rights of the Relevant Original Transaction Security Beneficiaries to enforce and/or to
release all or any part of the Relevant Original Transaction Security in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents; or

(b) restrict, limit or prejudice the rights and other benefits of the Debtors or any member of the Group
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt Document.

Each of the Secured Parties agrees not to take any action to challenge the validity or enforceability
of the Supplemental Security by reason of it being expressed to be second ranking (or any other lower
ranking).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Priority of Debts_

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Senior Parent Liabilities and Security”
below, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Debtors (other than any
Senior Parent Debt Issuer to the extent relating to liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or
Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or the borrower) to
the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank in right and priority of payment in
the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities as follows:

(a) first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Second Lien Lender
Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities, the Senior Arranger Liabilities, the
Second Lien Arranger Liabilities, the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes
Trustee, the Second Lien Agent Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee
_pari passu and without any preference amongst them; and_

(b) second, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari
_passu and without any preference amongst them,_

The liabilities owed by any Senior Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect
of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer
is the issuer or the borrower) to the Primary Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders shall rank
pari passu in right and priority of payment without any preference amongst them.

-----

_Priority of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the security shall secure the liabilities (but only to the
extent that such security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:

(a) first, the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities, the Senior Arranger Liabilities,
the Senior Agent Liabilities, amounts due to the Senior Notes Trustee, the Second Lien Agent
Liabilities and amounts due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee pari passu and without any
preference amongst them;

(b) second, the Second Lien Lender Liabilities, the Permitted Second Lien Financing Liabilities and
the Second Lien Arranger Liabilities pari passu and without any preference amongst them; and

(c) **third, the Senior Parent Notes Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities pari passu**
and without any preference amongst them.

_Senior Parent Liabilities and Security_

The Senior Parent Liabilities and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities owed by a Senior
Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent relating to Liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or
Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case
may be, the borrower) are senior obligations of that Senior Parent Debt Issuer. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, the Senior Parent Notes Creditors and the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors
agree that, until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, they may not take any steps subject to the
Security Documents in connection with any Enforcement Action, other than as expressly permitted by
the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set out in the preceding paragraph shall not impair the
right of the Senior Parent Creditors and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors to institute suit for
the recovery of any payment due by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer in respect of the Senior Parent
Liabilities and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities (in each case to the extent relating to
liabilities in respect of Senior Parent Notes and/or Permitted Parent Financing Debt where that Senior
Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower).

_Intra-Group Liabilities and Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the intra-Group liabilities and the liabilities of the Group
to an investor are postponed and subordinated to the liabilities owed by the Debtors to the Primary
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders, but does not purport to rank any of those liabilities as
between themselves.

_Additional and/or Refinancing Debt_

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders acknowledge in the Intercreditor Agreement that
the Debtors (or any of them) may wish to incur incremental borrowing liabilities (including guarantees
of such liabilities) or refinance or replace borrowing liabilities (including incurring guarantee liabilities in
respect of such refinancing or replacement). Such liabilities are intended to rank pari passu with any
other liabilities and/or share pari passu in any security and/or to rank behind any other liabilities and/or
to share in any security behind any such other liabilities.

The Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders undertake in the Intercreditor Agreement (at the
cost of the Debtors) to co-operate with the Parent and the Debtors with a view to enabling and
facilitating such financing, refinancing or replacement and such sharing in the security (provided it is
not prohibited by the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements at such time) to take place in a timely
manner. In particular, but without limitation, each of the secured parties authorizes and directs each of
its respective agents and the Security Agent to execute any amendment to or replacement of the
Intercreditor Agreement and such other debt documents and/or (subject to certain pre-conditions)
release and retake of security required by the Parent to reflect, enable and/or facilitate any such
arrangements (including, as regards the ranking of any such arrangements).

156


-----

If a Debtor incurs any new, additional or increased liabilities under any Secured Debt Document
and/or in connection with any Debt Refinancing, at the option of the Parent, the relevant Debtor may
(but subject to the relevant Debt Financing being elected to be secured in accordance with the
applicable terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the agreed security principles) grant to
the relevant Secured Parties in respect of all or any part of such Debt Financing additional security by
executing additional security documents which will benefit from the order of priority and ranking set out
in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Restrictions Relating to Senior Secured Liabilities_**

The Parent and the Debtors may make payments of the Senior Liabilities at any time.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Secured Creditors, the Operating Facility
Lenders, the Parent and the Debtors may at any time amend or waive the terms of the finance
documents in relation to the Senior Facilities (the “Senior Facilities Finance Documents”), the Senior
Notes, the Permitted Senior Financing Debt, the Second Lien Facility (the “Second Lien Facility
Finance Documents”), the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents and/or any Operating Facility
in accordance with their respective terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent required
under them).

_Security and Guarantees: Senior Secured Creditors_

The Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders may take, accept or receive the
benefit of:

(a) any security from any member of the Group in respect of any of the Senior Liabilities in addition to
the shared security provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to certain agreed
security principles:

(i) the security provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not already
a party in that capacity);

(ii) all amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender with respect to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security
Agent and applied in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application
_of Proceeds;” and_

(iii) any such security may only be enforced in accordance with the provisions set out under the
caption “—Enforcement of Security—Security Held by Other Creditors.”

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group
regarding any of the Senior Liabilities in addition to those in:

(i) the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior
Financing Document, the Second Lien Facility Agreement, any Permitted Second Lien
Financing Document or any Operating Facility Document;

(ii) the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(iii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the liabilities,
the benefit of which (however conferred) is, to the extent legally possible and subject to
certain agreed security principles, given to, or expressed to be given to, all the senior secured
parties in respect of their senior secured liabilities, provided that (except for any guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss permitted to be given to any ancillary lender or
issuing bank), to the extent legally possible, and subject to certain agreed security principles,

(A) the guarantee provider becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (if not
already a party in that capacity); and

(B) such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group
in connection with:

(i) any escrow or similar or equivalent arrangements entered into in respect of amounts which
are being held (or will be held) by a person which is not a member of the Group prior to
release of those amounts to a member of the Group; or

157


-----

(ii) any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other
discharge of any Senior Lender Liabilities, Operating Facility Liabilities, Senior Notes
liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities and/or Second Lien Liabilities (in each case
provided that such defeasance, redemption, prepayment, repayment, purchase or other
discharge is not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

All amounts actually received or recovered by any Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility
Lender with respect to any such security shall immediately be paid to the Security Agent and applied in
accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”.

Any such Security may only be enforced in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
which relate to security held by someone other than the Security Agent.

Any such guarantee, indemnity or assurance against loss is expressed to be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Restriction on Enforcement: Senior Lenders, Operating Facility Lenders, Senior Notes Creditors and_
_Permitted Senior Financing Creditors_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that no Senior Lender, Operating Facility Lender, Senior
Notes Creditor or Permitted Senior Financing Creditor may take certain Enforcement Action without the
prior written consent of an Instructing Group (as defined below).

Notwithstanding the above restriction or anything to the contrary in the Intercreditor Agreement,
after the occurrence of certain specified insolvency events (an “Insolvency Event”) in relation to the
Parent or a Debtor, each Senior Lender, Operating Facility Lender, Senior Notes Creditor and/or
Permitted Senior Financing Creditor may, to the extent it is permitted to do so under the relevant Debt
Documents, take certain Enforcement Action and/or claim in the winding up, dissolution,
administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event or process in relation to that Debtor for
liabilities owing to it (but no Senior Secured Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may direct the
Security Agent to enforce the common security in any manner).

_Option to Purchase: Senior Notes Creditors and Permitted Senior Financing Creditors_

Senior Notes Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Senior Notes liabilities or Permitted
Senior Financing Creditors holding at least a simple majority of the Permitted Senior Financing
Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors”) may, after the occurrence of an acceleration event
which is continuing, by giving not less than ten (10) days’ notice to the Security Agent (with the first
notice to prevail in the event that more than one set of Creditors serves such a notice), require the
transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees), in accordance with the applicable transfer provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement, of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the
Senior Lender Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities (a “Senior Liabilities Transfer”) if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Operating Facility Documents;

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and
the Operating Facility Documents are complied with, other than:

(A) any requirement to obtain the consent of, or consult with, a member of the Group in relation to
such transfer, which consent or consultation shall not be required; and

(B) to the extent to which all the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors provide cash cover for any
letter of credit, the consent of the relevant letter of credit issuing bank relating to such
transfer;

(iii) the Senior Facility Agent, on behalf of the Senior Lenders, is paid an amount equal to the
aggregate of:

(A) any amounts provided as cash cover by the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors for any letter
of credit (as envisaged in paragraph (ii)(B) above);

158


-----

(B) all of the Senior Lender Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all amounts that
would have been payable under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement if the Senior Facilities
were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that payment; and

(C) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Senior Facility Agent and/or the
Senior Lenders and/or the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer;

(iv) the Operating Facility Lenders are paid an amount equal to the aggregate of:

(A) all of the Operating Facility Liabilities at that time (whether or not due), including all amounts
that would have been payable under the Operating Facility Documents if the Operating
Facilities were being prepaid by the relevant Debtors on the date of that payment; and

(B) all costs and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Operating Facility Lenders and/or
the Security Agent as a consequence of giving effect to that transfer.

(v) as a result of that transfer:

(A) the Senior Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a Debtor under the Senior
Facilities Finance Documents; and

(B) the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability to a Debtor under
the Operating Facility Documents.

(vi) an indemnity is provided from each of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors (other than any
Senior Agent) or from another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders and the Operating
Facility Lenders in a form reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender and Operating Facility
Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities which may be sustained or incurred
by any Senior Lender or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or
recovered by any Senior Lender or Operating Facility Lender from any person being required (or it
being alleged that it is required) to be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender or
Operating Facility Lender for any reason;

(vii) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders or
the Operating Facility Lenders, except that each Senior Lender and Operating Facility Lender shall
be deemed to have represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the
corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the
making by it of that transfer; and (viii)the Senior Parent Creditors have not exercised their rights to
purchase as described under the provisions set out in the paragraph captioned “—Option to
_Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors” or having exercised such rights, have not failed to complete_
the acquisition of the relevant Senior Secured Liabilities in accordance with such provisions.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors may only require a
Senior Liabilities Transfer if, at the same time, they require a transfer of the Hedging Liabilities in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no Senior Liabilities Transfer may be required to be
made.

At the request of a Senior Agent (on behalf of the Senior Secured Acquiring Creditors), the Senior
Facility Agent and the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify that Senior Agent of the foregoing payable
sums in connection with such transfer.

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, no Debtor shall make
(and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and no Second Lien
Secured Creditor may receive from any other member of the Group, any Permitted Second Lien
Payment (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, a roll-up or capitalization of any amount and Second
Lien Agent Liabilities, and payments permitted under (b) to (f) under the caption “—Permitted Second
_Lien Liabilities Payments”) if:_

(a) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) an insolvency event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes
Indenture and/or any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement and/or a breach of the revolving
facility financial maintenance covenant under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (a “Material
Event of Default”) is continuing, from the date which is one Business Day after the date on which

161


-----

any Senior Agent delivers a notice (a “Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to that Material Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent and the
Senior Parent Agents until the earliest of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of Second Lien Liabilities, if a Second Lien Standstill Period is in effect
at any time after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice, the date on which that
Second Lien Standstill Period expires;

accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent and the Second Lien Agents
cancelling the Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(v) the Senior Discharge Date; and

permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement against a Debtor.

Unless each of the Second Lien Agents waives this requirement, (i) a new Second Lien Payment
Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the
immediately prior Second Lien Payment Stop Notice; and (ii) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice
may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a Material Event of Default more than 75 days after
the date that Senior Agent received notice of that Material Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice with respect to the
same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not
affect the right of the Agents to issue a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice in respect of any other event
or set of circumstances. No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served by an Agent in respect
of a Material Event of Default which had been notified to the Agents at the time at which an earlier
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under the Second Lien Debt Documents as a result of the
issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not
prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing
Agreement) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second Lien
Debt Document; or (ii) the issue of a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on behalf of the Second Lien
Secured Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

No Debtor shall be released from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest,
which shall continue to accrue) under any Second Lien Debt Document by the operation of the
provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Second Lien
_Secured Creditors and Second Lien Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted_
at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the Second Lien Debt
Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop—Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default, that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or,
as the case may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) any Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Secured Creditors an amount equal to any
Payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Debt Documents and which would have

162


-----

been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other Debt
Document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of Payments shall be waived and
any Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default
shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Second Lien
Secured Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing
Group:

(i) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require
the enforcement of any security; and/or

(ii) no Second Lien Secured Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in
relation to the Second Lien Liabilities,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Second
_Lien Enforcement” below, provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need_
be taken except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor
Agreement to direct such action.

**_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_**

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien
_Secured Creditors”, the restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—_
Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors” above will not apply if:

(i) an Event of Default (as defined under a Second Lien Financing Agreement, a “Second Lien Event
of Default”) (the “Relevant Second Lien Default”) is continuing;

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Second Lien Default specifying the event
or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien Default from the relevant Second Lien
Agent;

(iii) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Second Lien Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Second Lien Standstill
Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Second Lien Event of Default, the relevant Second Lien
Agent may by notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the
existence of such Second Lien Event of Default.

_Second Lien Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the
period beginning on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent serves
a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Second Lien Event
of Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) take any
Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor,
provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph, the
Second Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the
relevant Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) against such Second Lien
Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

163


-----

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or a particular
Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first-mentioned
Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver
or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Senior Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior Noteholders)
and any Senior Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Facility or on any
Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the
amounts outstanding on that Second Lien Facility or on that Permitted Second Lien Financing
Debt, as the case may be (provided that, unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred
or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity
does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after the date of the first utilization under
the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement).

_Subsequent Second Lien Facility Defaults_

The Second Lien Secured Creditors may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in
caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” in relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default even if,
at the end of any relevant Second Lien Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Second Lien
Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Second Lien Event of Default.

_Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Agents that it is enforcing Security created
pursuant to any Security Document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien
Guarantor, no Second Lien Secured Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set
out under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” against that Second Lien Borrower or
Second Lien Guarantor (or any Subsidiary of that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor)
while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in accordance with the instructions of
an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such
enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Secured Creditors_

Subject to the following paragraphs, any of the Second Lien Agent(s) (on behalf of the Second
Lien Secured Creditors) may, after an acceleration event under any of the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture or in relation to any Permitted Senior Financing Debt which is
continuing, by giving not less than 10 days’ notice to the Security Agent, require the transfer to the
Second Lien Secured Creditors (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not part, of the rights, benefits
and obligations in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, the Senior Notes Liabilities, any Permitted
Senior Financing Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities if:

(i) that transfer is lawful and, subject to paragraph (ii) below, otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (in the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes
Indenture(s) pursuant to which any Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior
Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant
Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility Documents pursuant to which any relevant
Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Operating Facility Liabilities);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (in
the case of the Senior Lender Liabilities), any Senior Notes Indenture(s) pursuant to which any
Senior Notes remain outstanding (in the case of the Senior Notes Liabilities), any Permitted Senior
Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain
outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities) and/or any Operating Facility

164


-----

Documents pursuant to which any relevant Operating Facility Liabilities remain outstanding (in the
case of the Operating Facility Liabilities) are complied with, in each case, other than as specified in
the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) each of the Senior Facility Agent (on behalf of the Senior Lenders), the applicable Senior Notes
Trustee (on behalf of the relevant Senior Noteholders), the applicable Senior Creditor
Representative (on behalf of the relevant Permitted Senior Financing Creditors) and the Operating
Facility Lenders is paid the amounts required under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iv) as a result of that transfer the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior
Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders have no further actual or contingent liability
to the Parent or any other Debtor under the relevant Secured Debt Documents;

(v) an indemnity is provided from each Second Lien Secured Creditor (other than any Second Lien
Agent) (or from another third party acceptable to all the Senior Lenders, the Senior Notes
Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders) in a form
reasonably satisfactory to each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor and Operating Facility Lender in respect of all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities
which may be sustained or incurred by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted
Senior Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender in consequence of any sum received or
recovered by any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender from any person being required (or it being alleged that it is required) to
be paid back by or clawed back from any Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior
Financing Creditor or Operating Facility Lender for any reason; and

(vi) the transfer is made without recourse to, or representation or warranty from, the Senior Lenders,
the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors or the Operating Facility
Lenders, except that each Senior Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing
Creditor and Operating Facility Lender shall be deemed to have represented and warranted on the
date of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect that transfer and it has taken all
necessary action to authorise the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the
Second Lien Secured Creditors) may only require a transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the
same time, they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement and if,
for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, no
transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

At the request of a Second Lien Agent (on behalf of all the Second Lien Secured Creditors), the
Senior Facility Agent, any relevant Senior Notes Trustee, any relevant Senior Creditor Representative
and the Operating Facility Lenders shall notify the Second Lien Agents of the foregoing payable sums
in connection with such transfer.

**_Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_**

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the Required Senior Consent, and until the Second
Lien Discharge Date, except with the Required Second Lien Consent, no Senior Parent Debt Issuer
shall make (and the Parent shall procure that no other member of the Group shall make), and neither
the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, any holder of Senior Parent Notes or the Permitted Parent Financing
Creditors may receive from any other members of the Group, any Permitted Senior Parent Payment
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, a roll-up or capitalization of any amount and certain amounts
due to the Senior Parent Notes Trustee for its own account, payments funded by amounts not received
from another member of the Group or payments funded by Permitted Parent Financing Debt and/or the
proceeds of any indebtedness incurred or pursuant to any Senior Parent Notes) if:

(a) a Senior Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment Default is continuing; or

(b) an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Second Lien Facility
Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement and/or any
Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement (a “Senior Event of Default”) (other than a Senior
Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment Default) is continuing, from the date which is one
business day after the date on which any of the Senior Facility Agent, the Senior Notes Trustee
and any Senior Creditor Representative (together, the “Senior Agents”) delivers a payment stop

167


-----

notice (a “Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice”) specifying the event or circumstance in relation to
that Senior Event of Default to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee
and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative until the earliest of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) in relation to payments of the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent
Financing Liabilities, if a Parent standstill period is in effect at any time after delivery of that
payment stop notice, the date on which that standstill period expires;

(iii) the date on which the relevant Senior Event of Default has been remedied or waived in
accordance with the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Senior Financing Agreement (as applicable);

(iv) the date on which the Senior Agent which delivered the relevant Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice delivers a notice to the Parent, the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee
and the Senior Parent Creditor Representative cancelling the Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice;

(v) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date; and

(vi) the date on which the Security Agent, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative take Enforcement Action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement
against a Debtor.

Unless the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative waive this
requirement, (i) a new Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until
360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the immediately prior Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice;
and (ii) no Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by a Senior Agent in reliance on a
Senior Event of Default more than 45 days after the date that Senior Agent received notice of that
Senior Event of Default.

The Senior Agents may only serve one Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice with respect to the
same event or set of circumstances. Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, this shall not
affect the right of the Senior Agents to issue a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice in respect of any
other event or set of circumstances. No Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice may be served by a
Senior Agent in respect of a Senior Event of Default which had been notified to the Senior Agents at
the time at which an earlier Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice was issued.

Any failure to make a payment due under any Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted
Parent Financing Documents as a result of the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the
occurrence of a Senior Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as
defined in any Senior Parent Notes Indenture or any Permitted Parent Financing Documents, as
applicable) as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Senior
Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Documents; or (ii) the issue of a Senior
Parent Enforcement Notice (as defined below) on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Neither the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer nor any other Debtor shall be released from the
liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under any
Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document by the operation of the
provisions set out under each section above under the caption “—Restrictions Relating to Senior
_Parent Creditors and Senior Parent Liabilities” even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted_
at any time by the terms of any of those provisions.

The accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with any Senior Parent Notes
Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice.

168


-----

_Cure of Payment Stop—Senior Parent Creditors_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Payment Default, that Senior Parent Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding
and/or, as the case may be, the Senior Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the
Senior Parent Creditors an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under any
Senior Parent Notes Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Document and which
would have been Permitted Senior Parent Payments but for that Senior Parent Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Payment Default,

then any Event of Default (including any cross default or similar provision under any other debt
document) which may have occurred as a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived and
any Senior Parent Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that Event of Default
shall be waived, in each case without any further action being required on the part of the Senior Parent
Creditors or any other Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Restrictions on Amendments and Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior Parent Creditors, the relevant Senior Parent
Debt Issuers and other Debtors may amend or waive the terms of the Senior Parent Notes finance
documents and/or the Permitted Parent Financing Documents in accordance with their respective
terms from time to time (and subject only to any consent required under them).

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group:

(i) no Senior Parent Creditor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the
enforcement of, any security; and/or

(ii) no Senior Parent Creditor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to
the guarantees by a member of the Group of any of the obligations of any member of the Group
under the Senior Parent Notes finance documents and/or Permitted Parent Financing Documents,

except as permitted under the provisions set out below under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent
_Enforcement” below, provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be_
taken except to the extent the Security Agent otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to
direct such action.

**_Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_**

The restrictions set out under the caption “—Payment Blockage Provisions—Restrictions on
_Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors” above will not apply if:_

(i) an Event of Default (as defined in any Senior Parent Notes Finance Document and any Permitted
Parent Financing Agreement, as applicable, each a “Senior Parent Event of Default”) (the
“Relevant Senior Parent Default”) is continuing;

(ii) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default specifying the
event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent Default from the Senior Parent
Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as the case may be);

(iii) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent Standstill
Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the Senior Parent Notes
Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative, as the case may be, may by notice (a “Senior
Parent Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such Senior Parent
Event of Default.

169


-----

_Senior Parent Standstill Period_

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the
period beginning on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”) the relevant Senior Agent
serves a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Senior
Parent Event of Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date (the “Senior Parent Standstill
Period”);

(ii) the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
guarantor of the Senior Parent Notes and/or any Permitted Parent Financing Debt (a “Senior
Parent Guarantor”), provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant to
this paragraph, the Senior Parent Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation
to the Senior Parent Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties
against such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against any other member of the Group;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a particular
Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(iv) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first-mentioned
Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver
or other permitted remedy);

(v) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Senior Lenders), the Second Lien Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Second Lien Lenders), any Senior Notes Trustee (acting on behalf of the Senior Noteholders), any
Senior Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions the Majority Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors) and any Second Lien Creditor Representative (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors) has been obtained; and

(vi) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding on any Senior Parent Notes or on any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be, at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding
on the Senior Parent Notes or on the Permitted Parent Financing Debt, as the case may be
(provided that (i) unless the Senior Lender Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed
by the Majority Senior Lenders and the Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date
prior to the date falling 85 months after the date of first utilization under the Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement; and (ii) if any Second Lien Debt has been incurred, unless the Second Lien Lender
Discharge Date has occurred or as otherwise agreed by the Majority Second Lien Lenders and the
Parent, such final stated maturity does not fall on a date prior to the date falling 85 months after
the date of first utilization under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement).

_Subsequent Senior Parent Event of Default_

The Senior Parent Finance Parties may take Enforcement Action under the provisions set out in
caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above in relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default
even if, at the end of any relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Senior
Parent Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other Senior Parent Event of Default.

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Parent Agents that it is enforcing security created
pursuant to any security document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent
Creditor may take any action referred to under the provisions set out under the caption “—Permitted
_Senior Parent Enforcement” above against that Senior Parent Guarantor while the Security Agent is_
taking steps to enforce that security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where
such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds
to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Subject to paragraphs (ii) and (iii) below any of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior
Parent Creditor Representative (on behalf of the Senior Parent Creditors) may, after an acceleration

Notes liabilities), any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement pursuant to which any relevant
Permitted Senior Financing Liabilities remain outstanding (in the case of the Permitted Senior

Facility Liabilities) (as applicable);

(ii) any conditions relating to such a transfer contained in the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement (in

Senior Lender, Second Lien Lender, Senior Notes Creditor, Permitted Senior Financing Creditor,

represented and warranted on the date of that transfer that it has the corporate power to effect
that transfer and it has taken all necessary action to authorize the making by it of that transfer.

Subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent
Creditor Representative (on behalf of all the Senior Parent Creditors) may only require a transfer of
Senior Secured Liabilities if, at the same time, they require a transfer of hedging liabilities regulated by
the Intercreditor Agreement and if, for any reason, such transfer cannot be made in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement, no transfer of Senior Secured Liabilities may be required to be made.

At the request of the Senior Parent Notes Trustee or any Senior Parent Creditor Representative

relevant Senior Creditor Representative, the Operating Facility Lenders, the Second Lien Facility Agent
and any relevant Second Lien Creditor Representative shall notify the Senior Parent Notes Trustee
and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative of the foregoing payable sums in connection with such

**_Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, among other things, after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor, or, following an acceleration event which is continuing, any
member of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of that member of
the Group in respect of liabilities owed to that party shall (in the case of any Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender, only to the extent that such distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery
of a type subject to the provisions set out below under the caption“—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior
to a distress event, only if required by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing
Group), subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from the Security
Agent and to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the
assets of that member of the Group to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities
owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. In this respect, the Security Agent shall apply
distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of
_Proceeds” below._

Subject to certain exceptions, to the extent that any member of the Group’s liabilities are
discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in
relation to that member of the Group, any Creditor and any Operating Facility Lender which benefited
from that set-off shall (in the case of any Creditor or Operating Facility Lender, only to the extent that
such distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions set
out below under the caption “—Turnover” and, in all cases, if prior to a distress event, only if required
by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment
instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the
amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds”
below and subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to the provisions set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” below, if the
Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any of the liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to
the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the liabilities.

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Debtor (or, following an acceleration
event which is continuing, any member of the Group), each Creditor and each Operating Facility
Lender irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent, on its behalf, to:

(i) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) against
that member of the Group;

(ii) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of that member of the Group’s liabilities;

(iii) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of that member of the Group’s
liabilities; and

(iv) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover that member of the Group’s liabilities.

172


-----

Each Creditor and Operating Facility Lender will (i) do all things that the Security Agent (acting in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) reasonably requests in order to give effect
to the matters referred to in this “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” section and (ii) if the
Security Agent is not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by this “—Effect of Insolvency
_Event; Filing of Claims” section or if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the terms of the_
Intercreditor Agreement) requests that a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender take that action,
undertake that action itself in accordance with the instructions of the Security Agent or grant a power of
attorney to the Security Agent (on such terms as the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) may reasonably require, although neither the Senior Notes
Trustee nor the Senior Parent Notes Trustee shall be under any obligation to grant such powers of
attorney) to enable the Security Agent to take such action.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if any Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender receives or recovers from any member of the Group:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities which is
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or, following the occurrence of a Senior Distress
Event which is continuing, any Senior Lender Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Senior Notes
liabilities, Permitted Senior Financing liabilities or Operating Facility liabilities;

(ii) other than as referred to in the second paragraph of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event;
_Filing of Claims” any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it which_
does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, other than as referred to in the second paragraph
of the caption “—Effect of Insolvency Event; Filing of Claims” any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities after the occurrence of a distress event
(including as a result of any litigation or proceedings against a member of the Group other
than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that member of the Group);
or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a
distress event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set
out below the caption “—Application of Proceeds;”

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any security except in accordance with the provisions set out
below under the caption “—Application of Proceeds;” or

(v) subject to certain exceptions, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or
in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by any member of Group which is not in accordance with

recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for the
Security Agent and subject to receiving payment instructions and any other relevant information from
the Security Agent, promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) subject to receiving payment instructions and any

instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the security as they see fit.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not
to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions from an Instructing
Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a distressed
disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the security which the

provisions under the caption “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement” above.

Prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, (i) if an Instructing Group has instructed the
Security Agent not to enforce or to cease enforcing the security or (ii) in the absence of instructions
from an Instructing Group, and, in each case, an Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to
make a distressed disposal, the Security Agent shall give effect to any instructions to enforce the
security which the Majority Senior Parent Creditors are then entitled to give to the Security Agent as
described under the provisions under the caption “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement” above.

contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the security is being enforced as set forth above under the caption “—Enforcement of Security—
_Enforcement Instructions,” the Security Agent shall enforce the security in such manner (including,_
without limitation, the selection of any administrator, examiner or equivalent officer of any Debtor to be
appointed by the Security Agent) as:

(a) an Instructing Group;

(b) prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if (i) the Security Agent has, pursuant to the third

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Creditor (other than the Senior Notes
Trustee and the Senior Parent Notes Trustee) and each Operating Facility Lender shall agree with the
Security Agent that it will cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by, or under the supervision of,
any judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency or rehabilitation or

174


-----

similar proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Agent. The
Security Agent shall give instructions for the purposes of this paragraph as directed by an Instructing
Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party can exercise or require any other Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement to exercise its power of voting or representation to
waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for payment or otherwise reschedule any of the
liabilities owed to that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender.

_Waiver of Rights_

To the extent permitted under applicable law and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each of the Secured Parties and the Debtors waives all rights it may otherwise have to
require that the security be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time, or that
any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the security
or of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or towards discharge of any of the
secured obligations, is so applied.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any security is held by a Creditor or Operating Facility Lender other than the Security Agent,
then that Creditor or Operating Facility Lender may only enforce that security in accordance with
instructions given by an Instructing Group pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (and for
this purpose references to the Security Agent shall be construed as references to that Creditor or
Operating Facility Lender).

**_Consultation Period_**

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, before giving any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
security or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or to take any other Enforcement Action,
the creditor representative(s) of the creditors of the Group represented in the Instructing Group
concerned (and, if applicable, any relevant Hedge Counterparties) shall consult with each other
creditor representative, each other Hedge Counterparty, each Operating Facility Lender and the
Security Agent in good faith about the instructions to be given by the Instructing Group for a period
of not less than 10 business days (or, in the case of any consultation involving a Senior Notes
Trustee, a Senior Parent Notes Trustee or a Creditor Representative in respect of any high-yield
notes, debt securities or other similar instruments, 30 days) from the date on which details of the
proposed instructions are received by such creditor representative(s), Hedge Counterparties,
Operating Facility Lenders and the Security Agent (or such shorter period as each creditor
representative, Hedge Counterparty, Operating Facility Lender and the Security Agent shall agree)
(the “Consultation Period”), and only following the expiry of a Consultation Period shall the
Instructing Group be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the security
or refrain or cease from enforcing the security or take any other Enforcement Action.

(b) No Agent or Hedge Counterparty shall be obliged to consult in accordance with paragraph
(a) above and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the Security Agent
to enforce the security or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of a Consultation
Period (in each case provided that such instructions are consistent with any applicable
requirements of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents) if:

(i) the security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event; or

(ii) the Instructing Group or any creditor representative of the Creditors represented in the
Instructing Group determines in good faith (and notifies each other creditor representative, the
Hedge Counterparties and the Security Agent) that to enter into such consultations and
thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the security would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the security; or

(B) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the security, and, where this paragraph
(b) applies:

any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the
Senior Secured Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting in relation to
the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (A) and (B) above; and

175


-----

the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of any instructions from an Instructing Group
to enforce the security, refrain or cease from enforcing the security or, as the case may be, take
any other Enforcement Action, the Security Agent shall provide a copy of such instructions to each
Agent, Hedge Counterparty and Operating Facility Lender (unless it received those instructions
from that person).

_Duties Owed_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, each of the secured parties and the Debtors
acknowledges that, in the event that the Security Agent enforces, or is instructed to enforce, the
security prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, the duties of the Security Agent and of any
receiver or delegate owed to the Senior Parent Creditors in respect of the method, type and timing of
that enforcement or of the exploitation, management or realization of any of that security shall, subject
to the section entitled Distressed Disposals below, be no different to or greater than the duty that is
owed by the Security Agent, receiver or delegate to the Debtors under general law.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

_Non-Distressed Disposals_

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed (at the request and cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Parent) to promptly release (or procure that any other relevant person releases):

(i) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset which is the
subject of:

(A) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, any Senior
Notes Indenture, any Permitted Senior Financing Agreement, the Second Lien Facility
Agreement, any Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement, any Senior Parent Notes
Indenture and any Permitted Parent Financing Agreement (each a “Debt Financing
Agreement”) (including a disposal to a member of the Group, but without prejudice to any
obligation of any member of the Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide replacement
security); or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement pursuant
to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group;

(ii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or waiver in
respect of that document or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any
obligations or take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the extent
not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

(iii) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any asset of any member of
the Group which has ceased to be a Debtor (or will cease to be a Debtor simultaneously with such
release); and

(iv) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a debt document) over any other asset to the
extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any holding
company of any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor (or any holding company
of any Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Group or a Debtor (including in connection with the
resignation of that Debtor or the Debtor being designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary), the Security
Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor
or the Parent) promptly release (or procure the release of) that Debtor and its subsidiaries (and its and
their assets) from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents.

When making any request for a release pursuant to this “—Non-Distressed Disposals” section, the
Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that:

(i) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (i) or (ii) above, the relevant disposal
or other action is not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement; or

176


-----

(ii) in the case of any release requested pursuant to paragraph (iv) above, the relevant release is in
accordance with terms of the Debt Financing Agreements,

and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the
Secured Debt Documents.

The Security Agent shall (at the cost and expense of the relevant Debtor or the Parent but without
the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor,
Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly enter into and deliver such
documentation and/or take such other action as the Parent (acting reasonably) shall require to give
effect to any release or other matter described above.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Parent in
accordance with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and provided that the requested
action is not expressly prohibited by any of the other Debt Financing Agreements), the Security Agent
and the other Creditors and Operating Facility Lenders shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, the
relevant Additional Security Provider and/or the Parent) promptly execute any guarantee, security or
other release and/or any amendment, supplement or other documentation relating to the Security
Documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and the Security
Agent is authorized to execute, and will promptly execute if requested by the Parent, without the need
for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor or Operating
Facility Lender, any such release or document on behalf of the Creditors and the Operating Facility
Lenders). When making any request pursuant to this paragraph (d) the Parent shall confirm in writing
to the Security Agent that such request is in accordance with the terms of a Debt Financing Agreement
(and the requested action is not expressly prohibited by way of any of the other Debt Financing
Agreements) and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under
the Secured Debt Documents.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Debt Document, nothing in any Security Document
shall operate or be construed so as to prevent any transaction, matter or other step not prohibited by
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Debt Financing Agreements (a “Permitted
Transaction”). The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) hereby agrees (and is
irrevocably authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any Party) that it shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent)
promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to
any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any Security Document) as is
requested by the Parent in order to complete, implement or facilitate a Permitted Transaction. In the
event that the Parent makes any request pursuant to and in reliance on the preceding sentence, the
Security Agent shall be permitted to request a confirmation from the Parent that the relevant
transaction, matter or other step is a Permitted Transaction and the Security Agent shall be entitled to
rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

If any member of the Group is required or permitted under the Senior Debt Documents to apply
the proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or
reduction of the Senior Liabilities then no such application of those proceeds shall require the consent
of any other party or result in any breach of any Senior Parent Finance Documents and such
application shall discharge in full any obligation to apply those proceeds in prepayment, redemption or
other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities. This paragraph is without prejudice to any
right of any member of the Group to apply any proceeds of any disposal or other transaction in
prepayment, redemption or any other discharge or reduction of any Senior Parent Liabilities to the
extent permitted or contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Senior Debt Document.

The Security Agent is irrevocably authorized by each Secured Party to (and will on the request
and at the cost of the Parent):

(i) release the security; and

(ii) release each investor, each Debtor and each other member of the Group from all liabilities,
undertakings and other obligations under the Secured Debt Documents,

on the Final Discharge Date (or at any time following such date on the request of the Parent).

177

_Distressed Disposals_

Generally, a “Distressed Disposal” is a disposal of an asset of a member of the Group which is
(a) being effected at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where a security interest has
become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the relevant security document(s), (b) being
effected by enforcement of a security interest in accordance with the terms of the relevant security
document(s) or (c) being disposed of to a third party subsequent to a distress event.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset of a member of the Group is being effected, the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, or the Parent and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other
Secured Party or Debtor):

(i) to release the security interest or any other claim over that asset and execute and deliver or enter
into any release of that security interest or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any
floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, its
guarantee liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets;
and

(C) any other claim of an investor, an intra-group lender, or another Debtor over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor, to release:

(A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing liabilities, its guarantees liabilities and its other liabilities;

(B) any security interest granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of any investor, any intra-group lender or another Debtor over that holding
company’s assets or the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company,

on behalf of the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders, Debtors and certain creditor
representatives;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities or the Debtor liabilities owed by
that Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend
that any transferee of those liabilities or Debtor liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a
Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities or
Debtor liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any debt document, the
Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of
the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that
any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Party for the purposes of
the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose
of: all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors and Operating Facility
Lenders and all or part of any other liabilities and the Debtor liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors, Operating Facility Lenders and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with

178


-----

the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or
any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed
Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or the Debtor liabilities, to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to:

(A) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
Debtor liabilities on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a guarantor
of Senior Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those
intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities
to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or Debtor liabilities are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities
or Debtor liabilities) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under the caption “—Application of Proceeds” (to the extent that the asset disposed of
constituted charged property), as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the
relevant security interest and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities has
occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities or Debtor liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of,
the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall
take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the
Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of
liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

Where Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities would otherwise be
released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned
may elect to have those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities transferred
to the Parent in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (to the extent legally possible
and at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Parent and without any consent, sanction, authority or
further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to
execute such documents as are required to so transfer those Borrowing Liabilities, Guarantee
Liabilities and/or Other Liabilities.

Subject to the immediately following two paragraphs, in the case of a Distressed Disposal effected
by or at the request of the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement),
unless the consent of each Senior Agent is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release,
transfer or disposal that the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash) and
such sale or disposal is made pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors
are entitled to participate or where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an
opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair from
a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees
in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation
to select or engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or
prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any
Second Lien Liabilities will be released or disposed of, or any security securing the Second Lien
Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) each Second Lien Agent has approved the release; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(ii) all claims of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Notes Creditors, the Permitted Senior Financing
Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than in relation to performance bonds or
guarantees or similar instruments) against a member of the Group (if any) all of whose shares

179


-----

(other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Group) are sold or disposed of
pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or
disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its
affiliates) and all security under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold
or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently
with such sale, provided that if each of the Senior Facility Agent, any Senior Notes Trustee
and any Senior Creditor Representative (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if any such
claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its Affiliates and not
released and discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the Security Agent
shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of its
affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to
participate; or

respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair
from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances, including the
method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial adviser may be limited
to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the
Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or engage any financial adviser unless it
shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If prior to the first date on which the discharge date for the Senior Parent Notes and any Permitted
Parent Financing Debt has occurred, a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that, generally, the
guarantees of the Senior Parent Notes and the guarantees of any Permitted Parent Financing Debt or
any security over the assets of a Senior Parent Debt Issuer or any Senior Parent Guarantor will be
released and/or the Senior Parent Notes liabilities and any Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities will be
released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

    - the Senior Parent Notes Trustee and any Senior Parent Creditor Representative has
approved the release; or

    - where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of the Senior Parent Debt
Issuer are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash);

(B) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other than
in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments) against a member

members of the Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such
sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security
interests under the security documents in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed
of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such
sale, provided that, if each Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(I) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater amount if such
claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser or one of its affiliates and not
released or discharged; and

(II) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(C) such sale or disposal is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors are entitled to
participate; or

-----

(II) where a financial adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion in
respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is
fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances,
including the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such financial
adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it
being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select or
engage any financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured
and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

(II) the Permitted Second Lien Financing Arranger Liabilities and the Permitted Second Lien
Financing Liabilities (other than the Permitted Second Lien Financing Agent Liabilities) (in
accordance with the terms of the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents and, if
there is more than one Permitted Second Lien Financing Agreement, on a pro rata basis
between the Permitted Second Lien Financing Debt in respect of each Permitted Second
Lien Financing Agreement),

on a pro rata basis and pari passu between the immediately preceding paragraphs (I) and
(II) above;

(v) in payment to:

(A) each Senior Parent Notes Trustee on its own behalf and on behalf of the Senior Parent
Noteholders; and

(B) each Senior Parent Creditor Representative on its own behalf and on behalf of the arrangers
under the Permitted Parent Financing Debt and the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors, for
application towards the discharge of:

(I) the Senior Parent Notes liabilities (other than any sums owing to the Security Agent) (in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Parent Notes finance documents); and

(II) the liabilities of the Debtors owed to the arrangers of the Permitted Parent Financing Debt
and the Permitted Parent Financing Liabilities (other than the liabilities owing to a Senior
Parent Creditor Representative) (in accordance with the terms of the Permitted Parent
Financing Documents and, if there is more than one Permitted Parent Financing
Agreement, on a pro rata basis between the Permitted Parent Financing Debt in respect
of each Permitted Parent Financing Agreement),

on a pro rata basis and pari passu between the immediately preceding paragraphs (I) and
(II) above;

(vii) if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any Secured Debt
Document, in payment to any person to whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to
any Debtor; and

The Security Agent is authorized under the Intercreditor Agreement to hold any non-cash
consideration received or recovered in connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part
of the security until cash is received for any such non-cash consideration, provided that the Security
Agent may distribute any such non-cash consideration to a Secured Party which has agreed, on terms
satisfactory to the Security Agent, to receive such non-cash consideration and the liabilities owed to
that Secured Party shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of that non-cash consideration
upon receipt by that Secured Party of that non-cash consideration.

_Liabilities of the Senior Parent Debt Issuer_

Generally, all amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent from or in
respect of the Senior Parent Debt Issuer pursuant to the terms of any debt document (other than in
connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the relevant security interests) shall
be held by the Security Agent on trust to apply them at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion)
sees fit, to the extent permitted by applicable law in the following order of priority:

(i) in accordance with paragraph (i) of the section captioned “—Application of Proceeds—Order of
_Application;”_

(ii) in accordance with paragraph (ii) of the section captioned “—Application of Proceeds—Order of
_Application;”_

(iii) in accordance with paragraphs (iii) to (v) of the section captioned “—Application of Proceeds—
_Order of Application,” provided that payments will be made on a pro rata basis and pari passu_
between each of the payments referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (to the extent relating to

relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer is the issuer or, as the case may be, the borrower) (iv);

(iv) if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any Secured Debt
Document, in payment to any person to whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to
any Debtor; and

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization of the Senior Secured Creditors_**

If, for any reason, any Senior Creditor Liabilities, Senior Notes Liabilities, Permitted Senior
Financing Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities remain unpaid after the relevant enforcement date
and the resulting losses are not borne by the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders in the proportions which their respective exposures at the relevant enforcement date
bore to the aggregate exposures of all the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility
Lenders at the enforcement date (or, in the case of Recoveries resulting from the realization or
enforcement of all or any part of the security or a transaction in lieu thereof, in a manner reflecting the
order of priority contemplated in under the section “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”),
the relevant Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders will make such payments
among themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant Senior Secured Creditors
and the Operating Facility Lenders in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
those losses are borne in those proportions (or, as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the order of
priority contemplated under the section “—Application of Proceeds—Order of Application”).

**_Turnover of Enforcement Proceeds_**

If:

(a) the Security Agent or the relevant Agent is not entitled, for reasons of applicable law, to pay
amounts received pursuant to the making of a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss or the enforcement of the security to the Senior Secured Creditors and the
Operating Facility Lenders but is entitled to distribute those amounts to Creditors (such Creditors,
the “Receiving Creditors”) who, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, are
subordinated in right and priority of payment to the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating
Facility Lenders; and

(b) the First/Second Lien Discharge Date has not yet occurred (nor would occur after taking into
account such payments), then the Receiving Creditors shall make such payments to the Senior
Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders as the Security Agent shall require to place
the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders in the position they would have
been in had such amounts been available for application against the Senior Liabilities and the
Operating Facility Liabilities, provided this shall not apply to any receipt or recovery that has been
distributed by:

(i) a Senior Notes Trustee to the Senior Noteholders in accordance with the Senior Notes
Finance Documents;

183


-----

(ii) a Senior Parent Notes Trustee to the Senior Parent Noteholders in accordance with the
Senior Parent Notes Finance Documents;

(iii) a Senior Creditor Representative to the Permitted Senior Financing Creditors in accordance
with the Permitted Senior Financing Documents;

(iv) a Second Lien Creditor Representative to the Permitted Second Lien Financing Creditors in
accordance with the Permitted Second Lien Financing Documents; or

(v) a Senior Parent Creditor Representative to the Permitted Parent Financing Creditors in
accordance with the Permitted Parent Financing Documents,

unless the Senior Notes Trustee, the Senior Parent Notes Trustee, the Senior Creditor Representative,
the Second Lien Creditor Representative or the Senior Parent Creditor Representative (as applicable)
had received at least two Business Days’ prior written notice (in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) that an acceleration event or an insolvency event in relation to a Debtor had occurred or
that the receipt or recovery falls within the provisions set out under the caption “—Turnover” prior to
distribution of the relevant amount.

**_Group Pushdown_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, generally, provides that on, in contemplation of, or after, a public
equity offering (an “IPO Event”) of any member of the Group (other than (x) a subsidiary of a borrower
or issuer which is restricted from being designated as such by the relevant Debt Financing Agreement
and is not replaced prior to such a public equity offering with another Group entity or (y) a subsidiary of
the Parent) or any of its holding companies (the “IPO Entity”), at the Parent’s option:

(i) the Group shall comprise only the IPO Entity and its restricted subsidiaries from time to time;

(ii) the IPO Entity shall take on the Parent’s role under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings or other provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement shall apply to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its capacity as a
Debtor or otherwise);

(iv) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any holding company of the IPO Entity (whether in its
capacity as a Debtor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term of the Intercreditor
Agreement or a default or an event of default;

(v) each holding company of the IPO Entity shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents (including any security
granted by any such holding company; and

(vi) unless otherwise notified by the Parent:

(A) each person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor shall be irrevocably
and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement and all obligations and
restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date specified by the Parent that
person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor and shall have no
further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement as an investor); and

(B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as an investor, such amendments being a “Group Pushdown.”

In the event that any person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as an investor as a consequence of the above paragraph, any term of any debt document
which requires or assumes that any person be an investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such
person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply.

The Parent must provide written notice to the Security Agent in order to implement a Group
Pushdown. Such a notice may be revoked prior to the IPO Event to which it relates provided that
(where requested by an Instructing Group) any security which was released is reinstated and any
investor which was released from its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement accedes again.

The parties to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or
replacement of it and/or take such other action as is required by the Parent to facilitate or reflect any of

184


-----

the matters contemplated by the preceding paragraph and the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
to promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or in relation to
any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any security document) as is
requested in order to complete, implement or facilitate such matters.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, it and/or a security
document may be amended or waived only with the written consent of:

Creditor Representative in respect of that Permitted Parent Financing Debt (if applicable, acting on

(viii) if a Hedge Counterparty is providing hedging to a Debtor under a hedging agreement, that Hedge

or waiver which is expressed to require the consent of that Hedge Counterparty under the
applicable hedging agreement, as notified by the Parent to the Security Agent at the time of the
relevant amendment or waiver);

(ix) if an Operating Facility Lender is providing one or more facility to a Debtor under an Operating
Facility Document, that Operating Facility Lender (in each case only to the extent that the relevant

Operating Facility Lender under the applicable Operating Facility Document, as notified by the
Parent to the Security Agent at the time of the relevant amendment or waiver);

(x) certain investors (as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(xi) the Parent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment or waiver of any Secured Debt Document that is
made or effected in connection with any Debt Refinancing (see “—Debt Refinancing”), any incurrence

_Disposals”) or in connection with any other provision of any Secured Debt Document (provided that_
such amendment or waiver is not expressly prohibited by the terms of any other Secured Debt

Security Agent without the consent of any other party, to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect
changes in each case of a minor technical or administrative nature or as otherwise for the benefit of all
or any of the Secured Parties. Any amendment, waiver or consent which relates only to the rights or
obligations applicable to creditors under a particular Debt Financing Agreement (and which does not

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the € aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes
due 2026 (the “Euro Notes”) and $ aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes due
2026 (the “Dollar Notes” and, together with the Euro Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by
Sigma Holdco B.V., a besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid incorporated under the
laws of the Netherlands (the “Company”), unconditionally guaranteed by Sigma Midco B.V., Sigma
Bidco B.V., Sigma US LLC and Sigma US Corp. (the “Initial Guarantors”) and, on or following the
Completion Date, be unconditionally guaranteed by certain members of the Target Group. Unless the
context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” the “Company” refers only to Sigma
Holdco B.V., and any successor obligor to Sigma Holdco B.V. on the Notes, and not to any of its
subsidiaries.

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together with the Equity
Contribution (defined below) and borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement (defined below),
will be used by the Company to finance the Acquisition (defined below) and to pay fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (defined below), as set forth in this offering
memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” Pending consummation of the Acquisition and the
satisfaction of certain other conditions as described below, the Company will, concurrently with the
closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, deposit (i) the gross proceeds of the issuance of
the Euro Notes into a euro-denominated segregated bank account (the “Euro Deposit Account”) and
(ii) the gross proceeds of the issuance of the Dollar Notes into a dollar-denominated segregated bank
account (the “Dollar Deposit Account” and, together with the Euro Deposit Account, the “Deposit
_Accounts”). In the event that, in the good faith judgment of the Company, (i) the Acquisition will not be_
consummated on or prior to December 3, 2018 (the “Longstop Date”), (ii) the Offer Letter (defined
below) or, if executed, Acquisition Agreement, terminates at any time on or prior to the Longstop Date
or (iii) certain other events occur, the Company will redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the Notes at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such Notes plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to (but not including) the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (defined below). See “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption.”_

Assuming the Completion Date occurs on or prior to the Longstop Date and the funds are released
from the Deposit Accounts, the additional Guarantors will each become a party to the Indenture
(defined below) upon accession thereto and will, to the extent legally possible and subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, guarantee the Notes on a senior subordinated basis as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Completion Date but in any case no later than 120 days from the Completion
Date. Prior to the Completion Date, the Company will not control the Target Group, and the Target
Group will not be subject to the covenants described in this “Description of the Notes”. As such, we
cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Target Group will not engage in activities that
would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants been applicable to such
entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue
Date among, inter alios, the Company, the Initial Guarantors and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited
(the “Trustee”). The Notes will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The terms of the Notes include those
stated in the Indenture. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference
to, or otherwise be subject to, the Trust Indenture Act.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the
terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will
prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of
indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the
procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover
obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the
Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a
description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

and this “Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be
designated to be of the same series as a series of Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if

with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

    - The Regulation S Global Notes representing Dollar Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited
with a custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Notes) or DTC (in the case of the
Dollar Notes), or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in
the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.” In
addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream will
be effected by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes of a series may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes of such series only
upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs
will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred
and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from
and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued, in the case of the Euro Notes, only in
minimum denominations of €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof, and in the case of the Dollar Notes, only in minimum denominations of $200,000
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, in each case upon
receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other
documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest
will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company to be in
compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on
transfer summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in

191


-----

aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of Euro
Notes) and $200,000 in aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof
(in the case of Dollar Notes). In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will
require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements
and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any
taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such
transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and
governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar is not required to register the transfer or exchange of
any Notes:
(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;
(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be
redeemed in part;
(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date
applicable to such Notes; or
(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Company, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the Holder
of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**
On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Company
will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**
Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Company will
deposit with a bank an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Notes sold on the Issue Date into
the relevant Deposit Account. Each Deposit Account will be established with an Initial Purchaser or one
or more of their respective banking affiliates and will be segregated from the Company’s other funds
and will be controlled by the Company. The Company will assign as security its rights, title and interest
in the credit balance in each of the Deposit Accounts to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders
pursuant to security documents dated the Issue Date between the Company and the Trustee (each
such grant of security, a “Deposit Account Charge” and, together, the “Deposit Account Charges”),
which Deposit Account Charges will provide that the funds will be segregated and held for the
purposes specified herein. The initial funds deposited in the Deposit Accounts, and all other funds,
securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Deposit
Accounts (less any property or funds paid to the bank holding the Deposit Accounts as ordinary course
charges or fees incurred in connection with the Deposit Accounts) are referred to, collectively, as the
_“Deposited Property.” See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Offering—The proceeds of the offering_
_of the Notes will be placed in deposit account and if the Deposit Accounts release conditions are not_
_satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the_
_return you expect on the Notes. No third party escrow agent shall control the Deposit Accounts.”_

Before the Deposited Property may be removed from the Deposit Accounts (the “Release”), the
Company must determine, on or before the Longstop Date, that:
(1) (i) the Acquisition will be consummated promptly following the release of the Deposited
Property and (ii) no material term or condition of the Acquisition Agreement has been amended or
waived in a manner or to an extent that would be materially prejudicial to the interests of Holders,
other than any amendment or waiver made with the consent of Holders of a majority of the
outstanding Notes (provided that if the Majority Lenders, as defined in, and pursuant to the Senior
Facilities Agreement shall have consented to any such amendment or waiver (or the senior
facilities are drawn without any such consent being required) then the consent of the Holders of a
majority of the outstanding Notes shall be deemed to have been granted to such amendment or
waiver); and
(2) as of the Release Date (defined below), there are no events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
court protection with respect to the Company.

192


-----

The Release will occur as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination described
above (the date of such determination, the “Release Date”). Upon the Release, the Deposited Property
may be paid out at the Company’s discretion.

In the event that (i) Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Longstop Date, (ii) in
the good faith judgment of the Company, the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the
Longstop Date, (iii) the Offer Letter or, if executed, Acquisition Agreement, terminates at any time on or
prior to the Longstop Date or (iv) there is there an event of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection
(as set out in clause (6) under “—Events of Default”) with respect to the Company on or prior to the
Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the “Special Termination Date”), the Company will
redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the initial issue_
price of the Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue
Date to (but not including) the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (subject to the right of holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Company, no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee and each Paying Agent, and will
provide that the Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after
such notice is given by the Company (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). On the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, the Company shall pay to each Paying Agent for payment to each
Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Notes and shall be entitled to use
the Deposited Property to make such payments. Notice of such Special Mandatory Redemption shall
be given to the Holders of the Notes at least five Business Days before the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the Deposited Property, one or more of the Initial Investors will be
required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, owing to the holders
of the Notes, pursuant to a commitment provided by such Initial Investors.

To secure the payment of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, the Company will grant to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders a security interest over the Deposited Property. Receipt by the
Trustee from the Company of either an Officer’s Certificate in connection with the Release or a notice
of Special Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release of
the Deposited Property from the Deposit Account Charge.

The Company from time to time, but not more than twice, may open one or more replacement or
additional accounts at an alternative bank or banks, which in each case must be an Initial Purchaser or
one or more of their respective banking affiliates, and may transfer any portion of the Deposited
Property to any such replacement or additional accounts (a “Transfer”) without such Transfer being
deemed a Release, provided the Company provides a substantially equivalent security interest to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders over such replacement or additional account or accounts as was
granted in connection with the relevant original Deposit Account and provided that use of the funds
from any such account shall be subject to the same conditions as applied to the original Euro Deposit
Account or Dollar Deposit Account, as applicable. In such an event, any replacement or alternative
accounts into which Deposited Property is transferred shall be deemed to be a Euro Deposit Account
or Dollar Deposit Account, as applicable. Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of an Officer’s
Certificate in connection with a Transfer shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the transfer
of the Deposited Property from the relevant Deposit Account.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Notes are listed on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), and if and to the extent that the rules of The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so require, the Company will notify the
Authority that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to
such special mandatory redemption. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent
or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Company pursuant to the Notes, including any payment
obligation resulting from a Change of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be
guaranteed, jointly and severally on a senior subordinated basis, by the Initial Guarantors. Subject to

193


-----

the Agreed Security Principles, it is intended that, within 120 days of the Completion Date, the Notes
will also be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the following additional guarantors (each
entity that grants such a guarantee, an “Additional Guarantor,” and the Initial Guarantors and the
Additional Guarantors together, the “Guarantors”). Each guarantee granted under the Indenture by a
Guarantor is referred to herein as a “Guarantee.” The Initial Guarantors will be Sigma Midco B.V,
Sigma Bidco B.V., Sigma US LLC and Sigma US Corp. The Additional Guarantors are anticipated to
be each Restricted Subsidiary located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany or The
Netherlands which is above a materiality threshold included in the Senior Facilities Agreement (based
on 5% of the EBITDA of the consolidated group). See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_
_Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.”_

The Guarantors will grant the Guarantees and will also grant a senior guarantee of the Senior
Facilities Agreement. In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each_
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that guarantees the Senior Facilities Agreement shall also enter
into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.
Therefore the Notes will indirectly benefit from the minimum guarantor provisions set forth in the Senior
Credit Facilities Agreement, as amended or restated from time to time. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Senior Credit Facilities Agreement—Guarantees.”_

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles
include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be
restricted by general statutory limitations, regulatory requirements or restrictions, financial assistance
laws, corporate benefit laws, liquidity protection rules, fraudulent preference, “earnings stripping,”
“controlled foreign corporation,” “thin capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as
otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial
assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Collateral—Each Guarantee and the security interests will be subject to significant limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity_
_and enforceability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The_
_Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries and effectively_
_subordinated to liabilities that are secured on assets that do not secure the Notes.”_

Under the Indenture, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon:

    - a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of ownership interests
in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that the Guarantor does not
remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case,
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

    - the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

    - defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge;”_

    - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor is unconditionally released
and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Facilities Agreement;

    - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (defined below);

    - as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”

    - with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—Guarantors” and the Indenture; or_

194


-----

    - with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor
pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the
Company or a Guarantor.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee,
subject to receipt of certain documents from the Company or the relevant Guarantor, will execute any
documents delivered to it by the Company in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and
termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Company, the Trustee nor any Guarantor will be
required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination.

Substantially all the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of
creditors of non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors,
including the Holders. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to
creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of such
non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of the Company. On a pro forma basis, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, the Company’s business in the Target Guarantor markets accounted for 43% of
its turnover, 46% of its Normalized EBITDA and 47% of its consolidated total assets, excluding
goodwill, intangible assets, investments, deferred taxes and inter-company assets. Only certain
subsidiaries organized or incorporated in the Netherlands, Germany, New York, Delaware and England
will guarantee the obligations under the Notes. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is
subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation
on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

**Subordination of the Guarantees**

Each of the Guarantees is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that, pursuant to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, each such Guarantee ranks behind, and is expressly
subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor, including
any obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain hedging
agreements and any other indebtedness ranking pari passu therewith incurred after the Issue Date.
The ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under their Guarantees is subject to
significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Guarantees, and
potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the Issue Date.

In addition, the Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances,
including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the
direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination
provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Guarantors would recover
disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating
to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the
principal of or interest on the Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. The
Guarantees will also be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including payment
blockage and standstill on enforcement upon a senior default. For a description of the restrictions
imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**The Proceeds Loan**

On or about the Completion Date, the Company will lend, pursuant to a proceeds loan (the
“Proceeds Loan”), the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to Sigma Midco B.V. The Proceeds Loan
will be subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the Guarantees. The Company will grant a
security interest in respect of the receivables under the Proceeds Loan to secure the Senior Facilities
Agreement on a senior basis and the Notes on a subordinated basis. See “—Security.”

It is anticipated that funds received by the Company as payments of interest under the Proceeds
Loan will be used to service the interest payments under the Notes. The Proceeds Loan may have a

195


-----

variable interest rate that allows for higher interest payments from time to time and the principal on the
Proceeds Loan may be repaid in order to service interest payments on the Notes. In addition,
subsidiaries of the Company may upstream further funds as needed by means of dividends or loans.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

On the Issue Date and until the Completion Date, the Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis
by the Deposit Account Charge.

Pursuant to the Security Documents to be entered into on or prior to the Completion Date, the
Company will grant in favor of the Security Agent, liens and security interests on the basis and priority
set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles,
certain perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, over the shares of Sigma Midco
B.V. and receivables owing to the Company in respect of the Proceeds Loan (together, the
“Collateral”). All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any
Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and hedging
agreements and may secure additional Indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral.
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations and certain future Indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the covenant “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and permitted to be
secured on the Collateral (see “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens”) will receive priority
over the holders of the Notes with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over
any Collateral. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the Company is permitted to grant security
over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted under the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral,
after all liabilities in respect of obligations secured on a senior basis to the Notes have been discharged
from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in payment of all liabilities in respect of obligations under
the Indenture and the Notes and any other Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement on an equal ranking basis with the Notes.

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each
case pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. In
addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and
perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt
which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under
law in certain of these jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents will be subject to the
procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement,
see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various
bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Company’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The insolvency laws of
_the Netherlands or the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of the Guarantors may not be as_
_favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering_
_payments due on the Notes.”_

In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted
under applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result
of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Company’s obligation under the Notes and a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See

196


-----

“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Guarantee and
_security interests in the Collateral will be subject to significant limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Company, the Guarantors and any other
Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the
Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the
Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale
of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes, the
payment of obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and any hedging obligations. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at
all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability
of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include
requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only
at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

The Trustee for the Notes on the Issue Date will have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will
be deemed to have:

    - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the
Security Documents);

    - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights,
powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or
other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents),
together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each
document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be
executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

    - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have
authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral as between (a) the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and other future indebtedness that is pari passu with the Senior Facilities
Agreement, (b) the counterparties under certain hedging agreements, and (c) the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes under the Indenture, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents, which provide that the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will
receive proceeds on enforcement of security over the Collateral only after the claims of the Senior
Facilities Agreement, certain hedging obligations and creditors under any future indebtedness that may
be secured on a first-ranking basis in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement are satisfied. See “Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_
_Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements_
entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. Under
certain circumstances, the creditors under such Indebtedness will receive proceeds from an
enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Trustee, the Agents and the holders of the Notes under
the Indenture. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and
“—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”

197


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary, the Trustee will take any action
required to effectuate any release of Collateral required by a Security Document:

(1) upon payment in full of all principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued
under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance with the Indenture;

(2) upon release of a Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture, the release of the property and
assets and Capital Stock of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person other than
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company”) that is permitted by the
Indenture (with respect to the Lien on such Collateral) or (b) the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Senior Facilities
Agreement, Public Debt or such other Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the
Lien over such Collateral is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge
thereof); provided that such release would otherwise be permitted by another clause above;

(6) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance
with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation;” and

(8) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection with
a solvent liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets
of such Restricted Subsidiary remain owned by the Company or a Guarantor.

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or
necessary, the Trustee without the consent of the holders of the Notes.

The Company, the other Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may also,
among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct
ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the
Lien under the Security Documents which has become worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or
useful in the business; (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets in the ordinary
course of business; and (iii) any other action permitted by the Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that is permitted to share in the Collateral (and which the Company elects shall share in
the Collateral), the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the request of the Company, enter into with
the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized representatives) one or more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement,
replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms_
that are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes) and substantially similar as applies to
sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and release of security;
_provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the_
Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable,
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security
Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the
Company shall furnish to the Trustee such documentation in relation thereto as it may reasonably
require. As used herein, a reference to the Intercreditor Agreement will also include any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any

198


-----

obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply
with the covenant described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Company and without the
consent of holders of the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into
one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect
or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by
any such Intercreditor Agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries
that is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in
compliance with the Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision to implement
any Permitted Collateral Liens in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, or (6) make any other
change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of Notes in any material
respect.

The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of the Notes of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted
below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor
Agreement, and the Company may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective
rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered
into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized
the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available to the holders of the Notes upon request and will be made available for inspection during
normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the office of the Company.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event (as defined herein), the Company shall be
entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”))
that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on
the basis that: (i) references to the Company and Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related
provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time
to time; (ii) all financial ratio, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Holding
Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of
the IPO Pushdown Entity (or the Company, if so elected); (iii) each reference in the Indenture and/
or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Company” shall
be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent applicable and unless the
context requires otherwise, and provided further that nothing in this clause (1), including the
deeming construct contemplated by this sub-clause (iii) and any action taken by the IPO
Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Company, shall, or shall be deemed to, directly
or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a
Default or an Event of Default); (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings,
covenants or Events of Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) or the other Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the
IPO Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no
event, matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall, or shall be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the Indenture or a
Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor

Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any such
Holding Company; and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Company: (A) each person which is
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor”
shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) (and from the date specified by the
Company that person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and shall have no further rights or obligations under the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor); and (B) there
shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor; and (viii) in the event that
any person is released from or does not become party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor as a consequence of this clause (1), any term
of the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
which requires or assumes that any person be an Investor or that any liabilities or obligations to
such person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of
Default that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
provision).

(2) The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to enter into
any amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement
(or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the other Security Documents required by the
Company and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate or
reflect any of the matters contemplated by clause (1) above, including a supplemental indenture
pursuant to which (i) the IPO Pushdown Entity will assume (on the Transition Date) all of the
obligations of the Company under the Notes, this Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;
_provided that such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose_
any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
Security Agent (as applicable), does not affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or
immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent (as applicable) under such Indenture, Intercreditor
Agreement, Additional Intercreditor Agreement or Security Document. The Trustee, the Security
Agent and any other agents party thereto are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the
Holders (without any consent by the Holders) to execute any such amended or replacement
documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on the request
of and at the cost of the Company).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company notified to the Trustee by the Company in writing as the person to be treated as the
IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event, provided that the IPO Pushdown Entity
shall be a Restricted Subsidiary which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant
to that IPO Event (or a Holding Company of such member of the Group).

(4) If the Company delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and Security Agent pursuant to
clause (1) above in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that
Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to
the Trustee and Security Agent. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance
with this clause (4): (i) the provisions of sub-clauses (1)(i) to (1)(vii) above shall cease to apply in
relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to clause (1)
above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a
replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any person party to the
Intercreditor Deed as an “Investor” has been released from the Intercreditor Deed pursuant to
sub-clause (1)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, that person shall as soon as
reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor Deed as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this clause (4) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the
Company from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO
Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or
indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term
in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a

Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason of any action or step taken by any person, or
any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that Pushdown Notice was effective or
otherwise).

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth herein and under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” and “—Deposit of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the_
Company.

At any time prior to, 2021, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the original
aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of
any Additional Notes of the same series) during each 12-month period commencing from the Issue
Date, from time to time, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the
Holders as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 103%
of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In addition, at any time prior to, 2021, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in
part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders as
described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2021, the Company may redeem either
series of Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice at a redemption price equal to the applicable percentage of principal amount set forth below plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date:


**Euro Notes**

**Twelve month period commencing on in**


**Dollar Notes**
**Percentage**


2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . % %

2023 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.0000% 100.0000%

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2021, the Company may, at its option, upon
notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” redeem the Euro Notes (i) with the net
cash proceeds received by the Company from any Equity Offering, upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to %, in an aggregate principal amount for
all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes
(calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes of the same series), plus
(ii) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date provided that in each case (a) the redemption
takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering and (b) not less than
50% of the original principal amount of the Euro Notes being redeemed (not including the principal
amount of any Additional Notes of the same series) remains outstanding immediaetly thereafter.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2021, the Company may, at its option, upon
notice as described under the heading “—Selection and Notice,” redeem the Dollar Notes (i) with the
net cash proceeds received by the Company from any Equity Offering, upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to %, in an aggregate principal amount for
all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes
(calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes of the same series), plus
(ii) accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date provided that in each case (a) the redemption
takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering and (b) not less than
50% of the original principal amount of the Dollar Notes being redeemed (not including the principal
amount of any Additional Notes of the same series) remains outstanding immediately thereafter.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, if Holders of not
less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes validly tender and
do not withdraw Notes of such series in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party making

201


-----

such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Notes, given not
more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder of such
series of Notes in such tender offer (other than any incentive payment for early tenders), plus, to the
extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, thereon, to, but not including, the redemption date. In determining whether the Holders of at least
90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes have validly tendered and
not withdrawn Notes of such series in a tender offer or other offer to purchase for all of the Notes of
such series, as applicable, Notes of such series owned by an Affiliate of the Company or by funds
controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to
be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer, as applicable.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to the
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an
Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering). In addition, if such redemption or notice is
subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the
Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such
conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been complied with or satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have
been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if
any) occurs.

Notwithstanding anything else in the Indenture or the Notes, redemption notices may be given
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is in connection with a defeasance of Notes
or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If the Company effects an optional redemption of any series of the Notes, it will, if and for so long
as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, if and to the extent the rules of the
Authority so require, inform the Authority of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate
principal amount of the applicable series of Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such
redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related
interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the
Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

**Sinking Fund**

Other than the Special Mandatory Redemption, the Company will not be required to make
mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as
applicable, will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and the Registrar, as applicable, by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of
Euroclear or Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Notes) or DTC (in the case of the Dollar Notes), or if
the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not
held through Euroclear or Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Notes) or DTC (in the case of the Dollar
Notes) or Euroclear or Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Notes) or DTC (in the case of the Dollar
Notes) prescribe no method of selection, on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool factor or by lot, as
applicable; provided, however, that, (i) in the case of Euro Notes, no Note of €100,000 in aggregate
principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be

202


-----

redeemed, and (ii) in the case of Dollar Notes, no Note of $200,000 in aggregate principal amount or
less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral multiples of $1,000 will be redeemed. Neither
the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this
paragraph.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the
extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Company shall notify the Authority of such redemption
and, in addition to such publication, not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior to the
redemption (other than in connection with a Special Mandatory Redemption), the Company will mail, or
at the expense of the Company, cause to be mailed, such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on the registration books of the Registrar.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original
Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case
of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount
thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable
redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become
due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on
Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Company may redeem the Notes of a series in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of such series of Notes (which notice will
be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”)
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due
on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Company or a
Guarantor determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the
application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including
a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Company or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of
Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by
taking reasonable measures available to the Company or Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable but not including
assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the relevant series of Notes); provided
that neither the Company nor a Guarantor shall be required to take any measures that in the
Company’s good faith determination would result in the imposition on the Company or a Guarantor of
any legal or regulatory burden or the incurrence of additional costs, or would otherwise result in any
adverse consequences to the Company or a Guarantor. In the case of redemption as a result of a
Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the Offering
Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of the Offering
Memorandum. In the case of redemption as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that
becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Offering Memorandum, such Change in
Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of a Successor
Company or the predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons
will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior
to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts
if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any

203


-----

notice of redemption of any Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company or Guarantor, or a
successor to either, where applicable, will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s
Certificate stating that the Company or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been complied with or satisfied and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Company or Guarantor, or a
successor to either, where applicable, has or have been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept such
Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the
Company is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or in
which it has a permanent establishment, or any jurisdiction from or through which such successor
makes any payment on the Notes or any Guarantees, and any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Company or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Notes or the Guarantees
will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes
unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) the Netherlands or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having
power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made by the
Payor or its agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, resident for tax purposes, or
any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Note or
Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor
will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holders after
such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments on any
such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no
such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Note to comply with any reasonable request of the Payor addressed to the
Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents
or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar
claim or satisfy any certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement relating
to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes;

204


-----

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar
Taxes, assessment or other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future
regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to
Section 1471(b) of the Code and any intergovernmental agreements (and related legislation or
official administrative guidance) implemented with respect to the foregoing;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is
permitted or required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have
been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment
from, another paying agent; or

(7) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made
without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for
payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant
payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of
the Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional
Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is
a fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the
beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor
will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such
form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably
available to the Payor and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made
available to the Holders upon request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment
made on any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable
and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may
deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the
payment date). The Trustee will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive
proof that such payments are necessary. The Trustee and each Paying Agent may rely on the fact that
any officers’ certificate contemplated by this paragraph has not been furnished as evidence of the fact
that no withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes is required.

Wherever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in
respect thereof.

205


-----

The Company will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other
property or similar taxes, charges or levies, that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery,
registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in connection with a transfer or exchange of the
Notes), excluding any such Taxes, charges or levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction, and the Company agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid by
such Holders. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will survive any termination, defeasance or
discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to
the Company is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms hereof, each Holder will have the right to
require the Company to repurchase all (equal to €100,000 aggregate principal amount, and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes, or $200,000 aggregate principal
amount, and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Dollar Notes) of such
Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date
occurring on or prior to the purchase date); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obliged
to repurchase Notes as described under this “—Change of Control” section in the event and to the
extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Company has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no
later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice (the
“Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Company to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on
the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior to the purchase date) (the “Change of
_Control Payment”);_

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Company, consistent with the Indenture, that a
Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the
Company will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Company in the Change of
Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Company; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Company.

206


-----

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail
to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such
Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate (or cause to be authenticated) and mail (or cause to
be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in
aggregate principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that
each such new Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes) or $200,000 and integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Dollar Notes).

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of
the Authority so require, the Company will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of
Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company
repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The
existence of a Holder’s right to require the Company to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Company or its
Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if
a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer.

In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” expressly permits a third party to obtain control of
the Company in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to
make a Change of Control Offer.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of
Notes validly tender and do not withdraw Notes of such series in a Change of Control Offer and the
Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described
above, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders,
the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase
at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest on the Notes that remain outstanding to, but not including, the date of redemption
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an
interest payment date that is on or prior to the redemption date). In determining whether the Holders of
at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding of a series of Notes have validly
tendered and not withdrawn Notes of such series in a Change of Control Offer for all of the Notes of
such series, as applicable, Notes of such series owned by an affiliate of the Company or by funds
controlled or managed by any affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to
be outstanding for the purposes of Change of Control Offer.

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which any
Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with
provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations, or require a
repurchase of any Notes, under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the
conflict.

Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would require the
repayment of such debt. Future debt of the Company or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company
from purchasing Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a
default or requires repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of

207


-----

their right to require the Company to purchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a
repurchase of, other debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of
the purchase on the Company.

Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance
that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Notes. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not have the
_ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of_
_certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Indenture and the change of control_
_provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain_
_important corporate events.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property
and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is limited case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result,
it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require
the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written
consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the
Indenture.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro
forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the

any time outstanding or (b) either (x) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary would have been
able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after

greater of €375.0 million and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any
particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion,
will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required
to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second
paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (11), (15) or (19) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of
credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such
other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(6) the amount of Indebtedness shall be calculated as described under the definition of
“Indebtedness.”

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness,
the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or
the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in
IFRS, including a change in IFRS or a change of IFRS to a different set of accounting principles, will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such
date.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence
of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated

211


-----

in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the
Company, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility;
_provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a_
currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated
restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of
such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so
long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums
(including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in
connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is
subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is
denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness,
if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such
Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of
any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due within
one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement, (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second

and

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued, in each
case, as provided in the definition of “Investment”) not to exceed, in the case of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case
under this clause (iv), was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted
Payments referred to in the first sentence of this clause (c); provided, however, that no
amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the preceding
clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Company’s option) included under this clause (v);

Company in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares of such Capital Stock, provided, however, that
any such payment, loan, advance, dividend or distribution shall not be for the purpose of evading
any limitation of this covenant or otherwise to facilitate any dividend or other return of capital to the

Company);

of such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted
Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount. Any amounts
(such amounts, the ‘“Excluded Amounts’”) that would otherwise be included in the calculation of the
amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of clause (c) of the first

216


-----

paragraph of this covenant will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the receipt of
Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities received in contemplation of, or in
connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control pursuant to the
definition thereof were it not a Specified Change of Control Event, (2) the purpose of, or the effect of,
the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities was to reduce the
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio of the Company so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified
Change of Control Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash
Proceeds, property or assets or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in
connection with such event in accordance with the requirements of the indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date,
or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness
(such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute
Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the
Notes and the Indenture (or a Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured equally and
ratably with (in the case of Liens with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness), or on a basis junior to (in
the case of Indebtedness which is Senior Indebtedness), or prior to (in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness) such Indebtedness for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and
(b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of
the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness
at the time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any
Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any
increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of
accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of
additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations
in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to,
create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities
Agreement) or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on
the Issue Date or, with respect to the Target Group only, the Completion Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such

217


-----

Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such
agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection
with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration
in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is
the Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or
any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in this second paragraph (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment,
supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in this paragraph; provided,
_however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary_
contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the
Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial
Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company), or that the Company
determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest
payments on the Notes;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any
lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted
under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the
property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements;
or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions
on the property so acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture
agreement that imposes restrictions on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition
to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or
the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or
disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with industry
practices;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers,
suppliers or landlords under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if the

218


-----

encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole
are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, together with the
security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) or where the Company determines when
such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in
any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens”; or_

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables
Financing.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent
or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on
the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition) of the shares and assets subject to
such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash
Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is directly or
indirectly applied by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (i) to prepay, repay or
purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Senior
Indebtedness within 425 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that, in connection with any
prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness including, but
not limited to, the revolving credit facility made available under the Senior Facilities
Agreement) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so
prepaid, repaid or purchased; (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness at a
price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase;
_provided that the Company shall redeem, repay or repurchase Pari Passu Indebtedness that_
is Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Company either (A) reduces the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari Passu
Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause (ii) by, at its option, (x) redeeming Notes as
provided under “—Optional Redemption” and/or (y) purchasing Notes through open market
purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par)
and/or (B) makes (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to
the Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Indebtedness
repaid pursuant to this clause (ii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition
Offer for purposes hereof); (iii) to purchase Notes through open market purchases or in
privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par); (iv) to make (at
such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders to

219


-----

purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset
Disposition Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for purposes
hereof) or (v) to redeem Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”; or

(b) to the extent the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary) or otherwise in the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries within
425 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; provided, however, that any such investment made pursuant to a definitive
binding agreement or a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Company that
is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such
investment is consummated within twelve months of such 425th day; or

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 425 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such
capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Company that is executed or approved
within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such capital expenditure is
consummated within twelve months of such 425th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clause (a) or clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce
Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 426th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that_
the Company elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the
greater of €150 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA and has not been committed in accordance
with clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant (or if so committed, has not been applied or
invested in accordance with such commitment within the relevant period), the Company will be
required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture
and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to
which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an
offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu
Indebtedness, at an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100%
of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the
case of (i) the Euro Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof and (ii) the Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes,
subject to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess
Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro
_rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu_
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such
aggregate principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the
Company that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (defined below). Upon completion of any
Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any
portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than

220


-----

the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of
such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into such
currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not
less than five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No
later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
_Disposition Purchase Date”), the Company will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate_
principal amount of Notes and, to the extent they elect, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be
purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful, accept
for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of (i) the Euro
Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof
and (ii) the Dollar Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. The Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes
or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Company in accordance with the terms of this
covenant. The Company or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not
later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to
each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Company for purchase, and the
Company will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or its
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Company, will authenticate and
mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an
aggregate principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that
each such new Note, (i) in the case of Euro Notes, will be in an aggregate principal amount with a
minimum denomination of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the
case of Dollar Notes, will be in an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of
$200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Any Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Company to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed
to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Company or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the
release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €150 million and 20% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the
fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the
Notes are then listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the
extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with
provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of €10 million unless:
(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and
(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€75 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved
by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:
(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than
pursuant to clause (9)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment;_
(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary
or any Parent Holding Company restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees,
directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the
ordinary course of business;
(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto and any
transaction pursuant to or in connection with an MEP, incentive scheme, deferred compensation
or similar arrangement (including any MEP Payment);
(4) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries;
(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or any Parent Holding Company (whether directly or
indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers
or employees);
(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments
pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue
Date or, with respect to the Target Group only, the Completion Date (or, in the case of any Person
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Completion Date, any arrangements of that Person
in place at the date on which it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary), as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time, and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other
listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

222


-----

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management
purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Company or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior
Management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

(9) any payments arising on the exercise of any put or call options (or any equivalent right or
obligation) in relation to any Associate or transaction in the ordinary course of business between
or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an
Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate,
Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of the Company or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and
other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company, (b) any amendment, waiver or other
transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other
provisions of the Indenture and (c) directors’ qualifying shares and shares issued to foreign
nationals as required by applicable law;

(11) without duplication in respect of payments made pursuant to clause (12) hereof, (a) the payment
of any fees (including transaction fees and annual monitoring fees), out of pocket expenses and/or
other amounts as reflected in the original terms of each Service Agreement (including any such
amounts payment of which is deferred), (b) payments by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent
Holding Company) of fees and expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed in each fiscal year
the greater of €16.5 million and 2.2% of Consolidated EBITDA for the period of the most recent
four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the date of such determination, and (c) payments
by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent Holding Company) for financial advisory, consulting,
financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities,
including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this clause
(c) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such
Permitted Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Company and its
Subsidiaries;

(13) any transaction effected pursuant to or in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(14) any transaction as to which the Company delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent
Financial Advisor stating that the transaction is fair to the Company from a financial point of view,
or meets the requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following
reports:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the first such report, 150 days) after the end of the fiscal year
beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date, annual reports containing, to the
extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the
Company as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income
statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the two most recent fiscal years,
including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the
provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available),

223


-----

together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year (and which have
not already been the subject of pro forma information provided by the Company); (c) an operating
and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of
operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a
discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies, with a
similar scope to that included in the Offering Memorandum; (d) a description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description
of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description
of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the first three fiscal quarters ending after the Completion Date, 90
days) following the end of the first three fiscal quarters of the Company beginning with the quarter
ending June 30, 2018, all quarterly reports of the Company containing the following information:
(a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the end of such
quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow of the Company for the
most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date,
and the comparable prior year period of the Company, together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance sheet information
of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income
statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since
the beginning of the relevant quarter (and which have not already been the subject of pro forma
information provided by the Company); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition,
EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion
of material changes not in the ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies
since the most recent report; and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Company or change in auditors of the Company or any other
material event that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report
containing a description of such event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with
IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as
then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that (i) the
reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS,
present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods and (ii) the Company may elect to
prepare information on a basis consistent with the method of presentation for the financial statements
included in the Offering Memorandum so long as applicable. Except as provided for in this covenant,
no report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company. The filing of
an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in (1) will satisfy such provision. At the
Company’s election it may also include financial statements of a Parent Holding Company in lieu of
those for the Company; provided that, if the financial statements of a Parent Holding Company are
included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the financial
statements of the Parent Holding Company and the Company shall be included for any period after the
Issue Date. Following an IPO on the Capital Stock of the Company or any parent thereof and/or the
listing of such Capital Stock on a recognized European stock exchange, the requirements of this
covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting
requirements of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information
required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a
reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Company or (ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case
may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together

224


-----

with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which
reconciliation shall include the following items: turnover, net sales, EBITDA, net income, cash, total
assets, total debt, shareholders equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of this covenant, the Company
shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on
such website as may be then maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to
provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Company in good
faith) or (b) to the extent the Company determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports or
statement available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or
after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports or statement to the Holders
and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. The Company will also make available copies
of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so
long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of
the Authority so require.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective
purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under
the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for
information purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or
notice of any information contained therein or determination from information contained therein,
including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture (as to which the
Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Company_

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or
substantially all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United
States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will
expressly assume (subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) (a)
by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Notes and (b) all obligations of the
Company under the Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result
of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be
able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to
the effect that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease complies with the
Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such consolidation, merger,
conveyance, transfer or lease have been complied with or satisfied and that the Indenture, the

225


-----

Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms. The Trustee shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without
independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or
that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a
result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the
Company which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis,
shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the
Company.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Company under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its
assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under such Indenture or the
Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) and the provisions described below under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Guarantors” (which do not apply to transactions
referred to in this sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4)
of the first paragraph of this covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate
or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the
Company, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary and (c) the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding
clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the
Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company, reincorporating the
Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.

_Guarantors_

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes
a Guarantor concurrently with the transaction); or

(B)

(1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person expressly assumes (in each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the

226


-----

Agreed Security Principles) all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee
and the Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B) and the provisions described above under “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company” (which does not apply to transactions referred_
to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor, (b) any Guarantor may
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
any other Guarantor and (c) the Guarantors may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a
Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Guarantor reincorporating the
Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with
any provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of
Liens, repayments and Restricted Payments), in each case, at the option of the Company (the
Company’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for
availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or
any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any
continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT
_Test Date”) that the acquisition agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into (or,_
if applicable, the date of delivery of a binding offer, a “certain funds” tender offer, an irrevocable notice,
a declaration of a Restricted Payment or a similar event), and if, after giving pro forma effect to the
Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions,
Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the
use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments and Restricted Payments) and any
related pro forma adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in
compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio,
test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied
with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such
Indebtedness is committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided
that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available,
the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the
basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be
deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, and
(b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, tests or baskets
(and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the
applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens,
repayments and Restricted Payments).

227


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios,
tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any
time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a
result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated
EBITDA of the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets,
tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a
result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence
of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or
tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with
or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such
requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied
(and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and
(3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or
transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and
prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date
that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable
notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be
determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Company will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors,
directly or indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or other
Indebtedness that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”), in whole or in part unless, in each case,
such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee is
Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form
attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee, which
Guarantee will be subordinated to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such
other Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and
delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to
which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted
Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of
such Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable
law or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to
clause (1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which in any case under
any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably
available to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) an inconsistency with the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any
action that would have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the

228


-----

Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the confirmation or
affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be deemed to
materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and
the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any
Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited
by the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens;” provided, that the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the
covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,” including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may
be discharged, transferred or released in any circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any
Lien in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over
the same assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for
Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral; or (iv) make any other change thereto that does
not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that, (except where
permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of
Permitted Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and holders of other Indebtedness
Incurred in accordance with the Indenture), no Security Document may be amended, extended,
renewed, restated or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), unless contemporaneously with such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement or modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Company delivers to the Security Agent and
the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or investment
bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors
of the relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or
replacement, or (3) an opinion of counsel (subject to any qualifications customary for this type of
opinion of counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a lien of at least equivalent
ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such
Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured by
the Permitted Collateral Lien is not subject.

In the event that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Lines of Business_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business
other than a Similar Business, except to such extent as would not be material to the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

**_Limitation on Layering_**

The Company will not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor shall, incur any Indebtedness
that is or purports to be by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness)
to be subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor unless such

229


-----

Indebtedness is pari passu with the Guarantee of such Guarantor or is also by its terms (or by the
terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) made subordinated in right of payment to the
Guarantee of such Guarantor; provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to distinctions
between categories of Senior Indebtedness that exist by reason of any Liens or guarantees or the
ordering of payment for any Liens; provided, further, that Indebtedness under a Credit Facility that is
Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor may provide for an ordering of payments among the tranches of
such Credit Facility.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the
following captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on_
_Affiliate Transactions,” “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,”_
“—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” “—Certain Covenants—Lines of Business,” “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Layering,” and the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the_
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company,” and, in
each case, any related default provision of the Indenture (the “Suspended Covenants”) will cease to be
effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants
and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a
Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
regard to actions of the Company properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and
the “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has
been in effect since the date of such Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred
solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion
Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at
the Company’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in
the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be
Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to
the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness
would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have
been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation_ _on_
_Indebtedness.” In addition, on the Reversion Date, (1) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the_
Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during the continuance of the Suspension
Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions” and (2) any encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses
(A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the continuance of the_
Suspension Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries.”_

The Company shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied,
although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above
to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of such event.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date,
(1) no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the
Notes or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligation arising during the continuance of the Suspension Event, in each case as a result of a failure
to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the continuance of the Suspension Event (or, upon

230


-----

termination of the Suspension Event or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that
occurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event), and following a Reversion Date, the
Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising
during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure to comply for 30 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the
Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any of the
Company’s obligations under the covenants described under “—Change of Control” above or
under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” above (in each case, other than a
failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(4) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written
notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date
hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”);_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
aggregate principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €250 million or
more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that,
taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments
aggregating in excess of €250 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company
has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of
60 days after the judgment becomes final and due (the “judgment default provision”);

(8) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in
excess of €250 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or
the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any
such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default provision”);

231


-----

(9) any Guarantee of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid
or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the “guarantee
_default provision”); and_

(10) the failure by the Company to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent
required, as described under “—Deposit of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes notify the Company (and, in the case of notice from the Holders, the Trustee) of the
default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7), the Company does not cure such default within
the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such
notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon
such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional
Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of
the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “Events of Default” has occurred
and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to
such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of
acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of
Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or
waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes
will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have
offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to the Trustee
against any losses, liabilities, fees or expenses which might be incurred by it in compliance with such
request or direction. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due,
no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee
cover satisfactory to it against any losses, liabilities, fees or expenses;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover; and

232


-----

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use
under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to
follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior
to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security
and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or
incurred by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and written notice of such
occurrence is received by a trust officer of the Trustee from the Company, the Trustee must give notice
of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of
a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee shall
be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive
committee or a trust committee of directors or trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that
withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee,
within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers
thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver
to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is
aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated to its
satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and,
accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the
provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover to it, and it will be for Holders to take action
directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may
not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, such Notes); provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification
will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders holding
not less than 90% of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of the Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note;

233


-----

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(6) amend the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the payment of principal or interest on
or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release (i) the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral or (ii) any
Guarantee, in each case, other than pursuant to the terms of the Security Document or the
Indenture, as applicable, except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and
the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, mistake, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or any
Guarantor under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in
a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the
issuance of Additional Notes;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the Covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,” to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the_
benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of
any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or
securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any
Note Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement,
in any property which is required by the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue
Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit

234


-----

of any Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the
Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
_Interest” is complied with;_

(10) to provide for the release or addition of collateral or Guarantees in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents; or

(11) to add any Senior Indebtedness or Pari Passu Indebtedness to any Security Documents to the
extent permitted by the Indenture.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely on
such evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by
any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered
invalid by such tender.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required aggregate principal amount of the Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, any Notes owned by the Company or by any Subsidiary
or any Holding Company will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under any series
of the Notes and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of
Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in
connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and
money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal
defeasance option, the Security Documents in effect at such time will terminate (other than with
respect to the defeasance trust).

The Company at any time may terminate its and the Guarantor’s obligations under the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company” and clause (A),
(B) and (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—
_Guarantors”) and “—Change of Control” and default provisions relating to such covenants described_
under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the
cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company and its
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provision and the
security default provision described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding
its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance
option, payment of the applicable series of Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default with respect to such Notes. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with
respect to any series of the Notes, payment of such Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Company” and clauses (A),
(B), (C) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—
_Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) or (9) under “—Events of Default” above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) (i) in the case of Notes denominated in euro, cash in euros or euro-denominated

235


-----

European Government Obligations or a combination thereof and (ii) in the case of Notes denominated
in U.S. dollars, cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar-denominated U.S. Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, in each case for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
applicable series of Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain
other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel from United States counsel to the effect that Holders of the applicable
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount
and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel
in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the applicable series of
Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with or satisfied;

(4) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or
is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940;
and

(5) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection
with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security Documents will be
discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or
exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when
(1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and
thereafter the funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become
due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the
Company has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or
appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose), (i) with respect to outstanding Notes
denominated in euro, cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof and (ii) with respect to outstanding Notes denominated in U.S. dollars, cash in
U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar-denominated U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in each
case in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not previously
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of
deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; (4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption
date, as the case may be; and (5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction
_and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have_
been complied with or satisfied, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as
to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any of

its Subsidiaries under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the
SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will
perform such duties and only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture, and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into the Indenture against the Trustee. If an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by the
Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs. The permissive rights
of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be
construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time
by giving written notice to the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a
conflict of interest as defined in the Trustee Indenture Act Section 310(b) that is not eliminated or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may
remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may
petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any losses,
damages, claims, liabilities, taxes and expenses incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad
faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.
Each of the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any
Officer’s Certificate in formulating its opinion or in taking any action (including, without limitation,
release of a Guarantee or Collateral) under the Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s Certificate
without need for investigation or verification (including for the avoidance of doubt the receipt of
Opinions of Counsel), except as may otherwise be expressly required under the terms of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses
in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any of the
Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and for so long as the rules of Authority shall
so require, the Company will notify the Authority of any notice with respect to the Notes. In addition, for
so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if
published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided
that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such
publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder
shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently
given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication
to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on
the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims

237


-----

against the Company for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Company and
the Guarantors under or in connection with the Euro Notes and the relevant Guarantees, as the case
may be, including damages. The U.S. dollar is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums
payable by the Company and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Dollar Notes and the
relevant Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages (each, a “Required Currency”). Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Required Currency, whether as a result of,
or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution
of the Company, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to it from the Company or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the
Company or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency
which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency
on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on
the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that amount of Required Currency is less than the amount of Required Currency expressed to
be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify
them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the
Company and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis
against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it
will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to
certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Company (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Company’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder
of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full
force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of
any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since, as of the Issue Date, certain assets of the Company and the Guarantors are held by
Subsidiaries located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the
Company or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if
any, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with
respect to the Notes or the Guarantees, may be difficult to collect in full within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and
the Notes and the Guarantees, the Company and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably
submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New
York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

(4) since the beginning of such period, any Person (that became a Restricted Subsidiary or was
merged or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the

EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto, including
anticipated synergies and cost savings, as if such Sale or Purchase occurred on the first day of

thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will, at the Company’s option as elected on the date the Company or a Restricted

period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date
may be calculated on a pro forma basis in a manner consistent with the adjustments described in the
definition of “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio”, assuming that all such Sales, Purchases, Specified
Transactions and Group Initiatives (and any change in any associated fixed charge obligations and any
change in Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom), including the full run rate effect of anticipated
synergies and savings, had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period.

If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the
beginning of such period shall have made or implemented any Sale, Purchase, Specified Transaction
or Group Initiative that would have permitted or required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio may (or, where applicable, shall) be calculated giving pro forma effect
thereto, including anticipated synergies and savings, for such period as if such Sale, Purchase,

252


-----

Specified Transaction or Group Initiative and the full run rate effect of such anticipated synergies and
savings had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro
forma calculations shall be made in good faith by the chief financial officer or finance director of the
Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary (or such other person as is performing the functions of
the chief financial officer or finance director), including synergies and savings. If any Indebtedness
bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness
shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had
been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable
to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an
interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation
in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any
Indebtedness under a revolving credit or similar facility computed on a pro forma basis shall be
computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period
except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally
be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency
interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually
chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may designate. For
the purpose of calculating pro forma effect under this definition, pro forma effect may also be given to
anticipated acquisitions where the Indebtedness to be Incurred is to finance such acquisitions in whole
or in part, which have not yet occurred but which have become subject to a definitive purchase
agreement or other contract.

“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of:

(a) Consolidated Financial Interest Expense of such Person for such period;

(b) all dividends or other distributions payable in cash (excluding items eliminated in consolidation)

(c) all dividends or other distributions payable in cash (excluding items eliminated in consolidation)
on any series of Disqualified Stock during such period; and

(d) any cash interest expense on Indebtedness of another person that is guaranteed by such
Person or its Restricted Subsidiaries or secured by a Lien on assets of such Person or its Restricted
Subsidiaries, but only to the extent such interest expense is actually paid in cash by such Person or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,

determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with IFRS.

“Governmental Authority” means any nation, sovereign or government, any state, province,
territory or other political subdivision thereof, and any entity or authority exercising executive,

Ratio”.

Indebtedness of such other Person (whether arising by virtue of partnership arrangements, or by
agreements to keep-well, to purchase assets, goods, securities or services, to take-or-pay or to
maintain financial statement conditions or otherwise); or

(2) entered into primarily for purposes of assuring in any other manner the obligee of such
Indebtedness of the payment thereof or to protect such obligee against loss in respect thereof (in

the results of operational testing procedures and excluding earn outs and other contingent
consideration arrangements);

facility shall be the total amounts of funds borrowed and then outstanding. In relation to any
Indebtedness in respect of bank accounts subject to netting, cash pooling, net balance, balance

any Person at any date shall be determined as set forth above or otherwise provided in the Indenture,
and (other than with respect to letters of credit or Guarantees or Indebtedness specified in clause (7) or

Notwithstanding the above provisions, in no event shall the following constitute Indebtedness:

Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”)
and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Regulation S Global Notes
representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance
with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Note”). The Rule 144A Global Notes representing the Dollar
Notes (the “Dollar 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes, the
“Dollar Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the
name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Rule 144A Global Notes representing the Euro Notes
(the “Euro 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Euro Regulation S Global Notes, the “Euro
Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name
of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes may only be offered or sold within the United States pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

Ownership of interests in the Dollar Global Notes (the “Dollar Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Euro Global Notes (the “Euro Book-Entry Interests,” and, together with the Dollar BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC or
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, respectively, or persons that hold interests through such participants.
Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and their
participants. Clearstream and Euroclear are direct and indirect participants, respectively, in DTC and,
accordingly, persons who have accounts with Clearstream or Euroclear (or with participants in
Clearstream or Euroclear) may own Dollar Book-Entry Interests. The Dollar Book-Entry Interests will be
issued only in denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The
Book-Entry Interests in the Euro Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Except under the limited circumstances described below,
Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in the book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and their
participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require
that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated
form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In
addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not receive physical
delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable (or their
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under
the Indenture governing the Notes. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry
Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither we, the Trustee, any of the Agents, nor any of their respective agents will have any
responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so
redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by
it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with
the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion
thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer
than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by
lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest
of less than $200,000 principal amount in the case of a Dollar Book-Entry Interest, or €100,000
principal amount in the case of a Euro Book-Entry Interest, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to the relevant paying agent. The relevant paying agent will, in turn,
make such payments to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) and to the
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (in the case of the Euro Global Notes), which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. We will make
payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or
future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be
required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes.” If any such deduction or withholding
is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes” above, we will
pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of
the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding to equal the net
amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or
Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners
of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents or any of their respective agents
will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e. the common depositary or its nominee) as the
owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of
the Issuer, the Trustee, the Agents or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility
or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry
Interest, or DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant;

    - payments made by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to payments made on account of a Book-Entry
Interest; or

    - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of
subscribers registered in “stock name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Dollar Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The

279


-----

principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Euro
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any
other action in respect of the Global Notes.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in
immediately available funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be
effected in accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately
available funds. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any
reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or
to pledge such Notes, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in
accordance with the normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with
the procedures set out in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will have a legend to the effect set out under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the
U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor
of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in
a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer
restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount
of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global
Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a
Book-Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

    - if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or
unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us
within 120 days; or

280


-----

    - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an Event of Default under the
Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the relevant registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a
partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one
Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of
the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no
Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than $200,000 in the case of a Dollar Book-Entry
Interest or €100,000 in the case of a Euro Book-Entry Interest will be issued. We will bear the cost of
preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date
fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part.
Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption or
which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a change of
control offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee, the transfer
agents and the registrars may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indenture. We may require a holder to pay
any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated
and is surrendered to the relevant registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the
Trustee (or an authentication agent appointed by it) will authenticate a replacement Definitive
Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require
a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient
in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or the paying agents appointed pursuant to
the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced.
The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer, pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to
such notes. Please see “Transfer Restrictions.”

Payment of principal, any repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will
be payable at the office of the Issuer’s paying agent in London.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the paying agents, the transfer agents and the
registrars shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global
Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the relevant
registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures

281


-----

solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the
Agents nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York
Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of
the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform
Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues,
corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants
deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and
other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry
transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National
Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered
clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC
system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream
is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge
such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive
certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such
persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating
procedures.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such
procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of us, the
Trustee or the paying agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under
the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Dollar Notes will be made in U.S. dollars and for the Euro Notes will be made
in euros. Book Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the

282


-----

settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form. Book Entry Interests
will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

283

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes. This summary deals only with Notes held as capital assets
(within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”))
by U.S. holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes for cash pursuant to this offering at their
“issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes of the applicable series is sold
for money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the Notes that is, for United States federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

 - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

 - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia;

 - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

 - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or
more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or
(ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated
as a United States person.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes
holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an
investment in the Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the
United States federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:

 - a dealer in securities or currencies;

 - a financial institution;

 - a regulated investment company;

 - a real estate investment trust;

 - a tax-exempt organization;

 - an insurance company;

 - a person holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale
transaction or a straddle;

 - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

 - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

 - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity);

 - a person whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

 - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the
Notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

 - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Code, United States Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and
judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, possibly on a

284


-----

retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those
summarized below. We have not and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take
positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes that
are different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare
contribution tax on net investment income or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax
laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any particular
purchaser of Notes.

**If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors**
**concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the**
**purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as well as the consequences to you arising**
**under other United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_Payments of interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, interest on a Note will generally be taxable to
you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting
for United States federal income tax purposes. Interest income on a Note will generally be considered
foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, will generally be
considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes
imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement
during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are
complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit
under your particular circumstances.

Interest on the Euro Notes will be payable in euros, and interest on the Dollars Notes will be payable in
U.S. dollars. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax
purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the
amount of interest received on the Euro Notes, determined by translating the amount of foreign
currency received (if any) at the spot rate on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether
the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with
respect to the receipt of such payment (other than exchange gain or loss realized on the disposition of
the foreign currency so received).

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may
determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest on the Euro Notes in accordance
with either of two methods. Under the first method you will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued on the
Euro Notes held during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of
exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) during which such interest accrued. Under the
second method, you may translate interest income at the spot rate on:

 - the last day of the accrual period;

 - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or

 - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the
accrual period.

If you elect to use the second method, the election must be consistently applied by you to all debt
instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. In addition, if you
use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Euro Note (including,
upon the sale of a Euro Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued
interest previously included in income), you will recognize ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to
the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the amount of
foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar
value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.

285


-----

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, you generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued
and unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above in “—Payments of
_interest”) and the adjusted tax basis of the Note. Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be_
your cost for that Note. If you purchased a Note with foreign currency, your cost generally will be the
U.S. dollar value of the amount of foreign currency paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on
the date of such purchase (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the
settlement date of the purchase, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for
U.S. federal income tax purposes). If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired or otherwise disposed of in
a taxable transaction for euros or U.S. dollars (as may be applicable), then your amount realized
generally will be based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the
settlement date of the sale, exchange, retirement or disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an
established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes). If you use the accrual method of
accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may elect the same treatment with
respect to the purchase and sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that
such election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by you from year to year. Such
election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Except with respect to gain or loss attributable to changes in exchange rates as discussed below, any
gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital
gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate
U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital
losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be treated as United
States source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as
exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will generally be treated as United States source
ordinary income or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price
for the Note calculated in euros or U.S. dollars (in the case of Euro Notes or Dollar Notes, respectively)
on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference
between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the
principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the
case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement dates of such purchase and
taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal
income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized on the disposition of the Note
(with respect to both principal and accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss
realized on the disposition of the Note.

**_Disposition of foreign currency_**

Your tax basis in euros received as interest on a Euro Note or on the sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition of a Euro Note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on
the date the euros are received. Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other
disposition of the euros will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Reportable transactions_**

United States Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax
shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the United States Treasury regulations, certain
transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency
received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or
other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering
the purchase of a Euro Note, you should consult with your own tax advisors to determine the tax return
obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Euro Notes, including any requirement to file
IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

286


-----

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

Generally, information reporting will apply to all payments of interest and principal on a Note and the
proceeds from a sale or other disposition of a Note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient.
Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest
payments, fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you
may be subject to backup withholding on any such payments or proceeds.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability
provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Certain Dutch Tax Considerations**

This summary solely addresses the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership
and disposal of Notes and does not purport to describe every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to
a particular holder. Tax matters are complex, and the tax consequences of this offering to a particular
holder of Notes will depend in part on such holder’s circumstances. Accordingly, a holder is urged to
consult his own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of this offering to him,
including the applicability and effect of Dutch tax laws.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the
meaning to be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the
equivalent Dutch concepts under Dutch tax law. Where in this summary the terms “the Netherlands”
and “Dutch” are used, these refer solely to the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This
summary assumes that the Issuer is organized, and that its business will be conducted, in the manner
outlined in this offering memorandum. A change to such organizational structure or to the manner in
which the Issuer conducts its business may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be
updated to reflect any such change.

This summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it
stands at the date of this offering memorandum. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is
subject to changes, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of
this summary, which will not be updated to reflect such change.

The summary in this Dutch taxation section does not address the Dutch tax consequences for a holder
of Notes who:

 - is an individual or corporate entity, including an association, partnership and mutual fund, taxable
as a corporate entity, who may be deemed an owner of Notes for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to
specific statutory attribution rules in Dutch tax law;

 - is an individual or corporate entity which holds or is deemed to hold a substantial interest
(aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer;

 - is an corporate entity that is, in whole or in part, not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate
income tax, such as fiscal investment institutions, exempt investment institutions and pension
funds as defined in the Dutch Corporation Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting
_1969);_

 - owns Notes in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an
employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role;

 - is a corporate entity, being resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten; or

 - is not considered the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of the Notes and/or the benefits
derived from the Notes.

**_Withholding tax_**

All payments under the Notes may be made free from withholding or deduction of or for any taxes of
whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision
or taxing authority of or in the Netherlands.

**_Taxes on income and capital gains_**

_Resident holders of Notes_

In general, a holder of Notes who is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax
purposes is fully subject to Dutch personal income tax if he is an individual or fully subject to Dutch
corporate income tax if it is a corporate entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual
fund, taxable as a corporate entity, as described in the summary below.

_Individuals deriving profits or deemed to be deriving profits from an enterprise_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that are attributable to
an enterprise from which an individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or
pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise (mede-gerechtigde tot het vermogen),
other than as a shareholder, are generally subject to Dutch personal income tax at progressive rates
up to 51,95%.

_Individuals deriving benefits from miscellaneous activities_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that constitute benefits
from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) by an individual, including
activities that go beyond regular active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer), are
generally subject to Dutch personal income tax at progressive rates up to 51,95%.

_Other individuals_

If a holder of Notes is an individual whose situation has not been discussed before in this section
“Dutch Tax Considerations—Taxes on income and capital gains—Resident holders of Notes”, the fair
market value of his Notes forms part of the yield basis for purposes of tax on benefits from savings and
investments. A deemed benefit, which is determined on the basis of progressive rates starting from
2.017% up to 5.38% per annum of this yield basis is taxed at the rate of 30%, if the yield basis exceeds
a certain threshold. Actual income, gains or losses derived from or in connection with the Notes are not
subject to Dutch personal income tax.

_Corporate entities_

A corporate entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund being resident or deemed
to be resident of the Netherlands for the Dutch corporate income tax, holding a Note will generally be
subject to Dutch corporate income tax in respect of all benefits derived or deemed to be derived from
or in connection with the Note.

_General_

A holder of Notes will not be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes by
reason only of the execution and/or enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of the Notes or
the performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Notes.

_Non-resident holders of Notes_

_Individuals_

If a holder of Notes is an individual who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch personal income tax, he will not be subject to Dutch personal
income tax in respect of any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with
Notes, except if:

 - he derives profits from an enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a
co-entitlement to the net value of such enterprise (mede-gerechtigde tot het vermogen), other than
as a shareholder, and such enterprise is carried on, in whole or in part, through a permanent
establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the
Netherlands, and his Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent
representative; or

288


-----

 - he derives benefits or is deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Notes that are
taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), including
activities that go beyond regular active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer),
performed in the Netherlands.

_Corporate entities_

If a holder of Notes is a corporate entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund,
taxable as a corporate entity, which is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands
for purposes of Dutch corporation tax, it will not be subject to Dutch corporate income tax in respect of
any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes, except if:

 - it derives profits from an enterprise directly which is carried on, in whole or in part, through a
permanent establishment (vaste _inrichting)_ or a permanent representative (vaste
_vertegenwoordiger) which is taxable in the Netherlands, and to which permanent establishment or_
permanent representative its Notes are attributable; or

 - it derives profits pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise (mede-gerechtigde
_tot het vermogen) which is managed in the Netherlands, other than as a holder of securities, and_
to which enterprise its Notes are attributable.

_General_

If a holder of Notes is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such holder will
for Dutch tax purposes not carry on or be deemed to carry on an enterprise, in whole or in part,
through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands by reason only
of the execution and/or enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of the Notes or the
performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Notes.

**_Gift and inheritance taxes_**

Dutch gift or inheritance tax will arise with respect to a transfer of Notes by way of gift or upon the
death of a holder of Notes who is resident, or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands at the time of
the gift or his death. No Dutch gift or inheritance tax will arise when a holder of Notes is not resident, or
deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands at the time of the gift, unless:

 - the holder of a Note is an individual, not being resident, or deemed to be resident, of the
Netherlands at the time of the gift, and dies within 180 days after the date of the gift being a
resident, or deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands.

 - the gift is made under a condition precedent and at the time of this condition is fulfilled, the holder
of a Note is resident, or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands.

For Dutch gift and inheritance tax purposes, an individual holding the Dutch nationality is deemed to be
resident in the Netherlands, if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the past ten
years.

For Dutch gift and inheritance tax purposes, an individual, not holding the Dutch nationality, is deemed
to be resident in the Netherlands if he has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during the
twelve months preceding the date of the gift.

**_Registration taxes and duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, transfer tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty, other
than court fees, will be payable by the holder of Notes in the Netherlands in respect of or in connection
with the execution and/or enforcement (including by legal proceedings and including the enforcement
of any foreign judgment in the courts of the Netherlands) of the documents relating to the issue of the
Notes, the performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Notes, or
the transfer of the Notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Notes by
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are
subject to Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or
other laws or regulations that are similar to such provisions of the Code or ERISA (collectively, “Similar
Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan,
account or arrangement (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to
Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions
involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and
the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of
such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who
renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally
considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the
Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s
duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in
specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within
the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code,
unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a
non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, the
Initial Purchasers, or the Guarantors is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may
constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an
applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S.
Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply
to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE
84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers,
PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank
collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and
PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the
above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA
Plans considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption
should carefully review the exemption to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of
the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not
subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law.
Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to
determine the need for, if necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar
Law.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be acquired or held by any person investing “plan
assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute or

290


-----

result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the
Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

Each purchaser and subsequent transferee of a Note will be deemed to have given the
acknowledgments, representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the
complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering
purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding
the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment
and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**
**COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_security interests in each of the jurisdictions in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are organized_
_(other than the United States). It is a summary only, and bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or a_
_similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a_
_future guarantor of the Notes. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could_
_trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to_
_enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the Guarantees and the security_
_interests on the Collateral. Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency_
_law in the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom._

**European Union**

The Issuer and several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of member states of the
European Union (the “Member States,” and each a “Member State”). As such, they are subject to
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council dated May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast) (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which entered into force on June 26,
2015, and applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017. It has replaced Council
Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended by Council Regulation (EC)
No 663/2014 of June 5, 2014 (the “Old EU Insolvency Regulation”).

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which has jurisdiction to open “main insolvency
proceedings” in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where
the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main
interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing
and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although
there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that any company
or legal person has its “centre of main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered
office, Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor
shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
“which is ascertainable by third parties.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are
held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the
large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the
place where the company has its “centre of main interests.”

The point at which a company’s “centre of main interest” is determined is at the time that the relevant
insolvency proceedings are opened. The rebuttable presumption that a company has its “centre of
main interests” in the Member State in which it has its registered office shall only apply if the registered
office has not been moved to another Member State within a three-month period prior to the request
for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption
if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered
office, and if a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is
ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of
the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special
consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the
administration of its interests. The EU Insolvency Regulation has thereby basically implemented the
existing case law of the European Court of Justice regarding the assessment of the place of the
company’s centre of main interests into the text of the law. It has also, however, increased the
requirements for a shift of the centre of main interest shortly prior to the filing for insolvency. In the
event of a shift in the centre of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new
location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to
the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location public
through other appropriate means).

Where the centre of main interests of a company is located in a Member State (other than Denmark),
the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would

292


-----

be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Main insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency
Regulation are to be recognized and given effect to (subject to some exceptions) in all the other
Member States (other than Denmark), although “secondary proceedings” may be opened in another
Member State (other than Denmark), in the circumstances described below. If the company does not
have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction
to open secondary proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The courts of a Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings”
(before the opening of main insolvency proceedings) or “secondary proceedings” (after the opening of
main insolvency proceedings) only in the event that a debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of
such other Member State (not being the Member State in which such debtor has its centre of main
interest). The effects of “territorial proceedings” or “secondary proceedings” shall be restricted to the
assets of the debtor situated in the territory of the Member State where such proceedings are opened.
The determination of whether a company has an “establishment” and where it is situated is also a
question of fact and is not a static concept. As such, an establishment could be created and may
change from time to time. According to Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, an
“establishment” means any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the
three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets. A “place of operations” is likely to be construed as a
place from which economic activities are conducted on the market using human resources which
requires a minimum level of organisation so that a purely occasional place of operations is unlikely to
be classified as an “establishment”, rather a certain level of stability of such operations is necessary. In
its judgment dated October 20, 2011 (“Interedil”), rendered under the Old EU Insolvency Regulation,
the European Court of Justice confirmed that the creation of an “establishment” within the meaning of
the Old EU Insolvency Regulation requires the existence of a structure which is designated for the
performance of business activities with a minimum level of organisation and a certain degree of
stability.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries or a Guarantor experience
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.
Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of, and the security granted
by, the Issuer, any of its subsidiaries and/or any Guarantor. The insolvency and other laws of the
jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different
from, or (subject to the framework provided for under the EU Insolvency Regulation) conflict with, each
other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions
will be applied in relation to one another.

On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum to decide on the United Kingdom’s
membership of the European Union. The United Kingdom vote was to leave the European Union. The
terms on which the United Kingdom will exit the European Union are not certain and therefore it is not
possible to know what impact any exit by the United Kingdom of the European Union will have on the
application of the EU Insolvency Regulation to any insolvency proceedings (including, without
limitation, the commencement of such insolvency proceedings and the jurisdiction of the United
Kingdom courts to open such insolvency proceedings) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor may be
subject.

**The Netherlands**

**Insolvency**

Subject to the limitations described under “—European Union”, where a company (incorporated in The
Netherlands or elsewhere) has its “centre of main interests” or an “establishment” in The Netherlands,
it may be subjected to Dutch insolvency proceedings. This is particularly relevant for the Issuer and
certain of the Guarantors, which have their corporate seats (statutaire zetel) in The Netherlands, and
are therefore each presumed (subject to proof to the contrary) to have their “centre of main interests” in
The Netherlands.

293


-----

Dutch insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for holders of Notes to recover the amount they would
normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law applicable to legal entities: the first,
suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a
debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy
(faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to
its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act. A general description
of the principles of both insolvency regimes is set forth below.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, in which both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to exercise remedies against the debtor without court
approval, in suspension of payments and bankruptcy proceedings under Dutch law, secured creditors
(and in case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security
authorities)) may enforce their rights against assets of the company to satisfy their claims as if there
were no insolvency proceedings. A recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets
that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. Consequently, your potential recovery could
be reduced in Dutch insolvency proceedings.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights
must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities.
A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights of up to two months, extendable by
another period of up to two months, may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a
secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing which the
receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred
claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy
costs, which may be significant. Also, in this case, the secured creditor will have to wait until the
distribution plan becomes final for payment. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to
the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such
set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although it may be subject to clawback in the event of a
fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when
suspension of payments is granted and terminated by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In
addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of
payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration
of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such
termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

In a suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors.
A composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is (i) approved by a
simple majority of the creditors being present or represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at
least 50% of the amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) subsequently
ratified (gehomologeerd) by the Dutch courts. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could preclude or
inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a
holder of Notes.

Claims against a company subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings will have to be verified in the
insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to
distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the
treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, that
the value of the claim is determined and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the insolvency
proceedings. The valuation of claims that would not otherwise have been payable at the time of the
proceedings may be based on a net present value analysis. Unless secured by a pledge or a
mortgage, interest accruing after the date on which insolvency proceedings are opened cannot be
verified. Where interest is accruing after the date of opening of the proceedings, it can be admitted pro
_memoria._

The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be
challenged in the Dutch insolvency proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting
(verificatievergadering), the receiver in bankruptcy, the administrator in suspension of payment

294


-----

proceedings, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of
other creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors meeting may be
referred to separate court proceedings (renvooiprocedure) in bankruptcy, while in suspension of
payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These
situations could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes.
_Renvooi procedures could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed compared to_
holders of undisputed claims.

The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining
amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among
the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual
subordination will generally be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings, with the actual effect
largely depending on the way such subordination is construed.

**Fraudulent transfer / conveyance**

Under Dutch law, a legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement
pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide
or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements
benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in an
insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its receiver in
bankruptcy, if (a) it performed such act without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (b) the creditor
concerned or, in the case of its bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of the act,
and (c) at the time the act was performed both it and (unless the act was for no consideration (om
_niet)) the party with or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its_
creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). In the case of a bankruptcy, the
beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to
have known that creditors of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of
the granting and for no consideration. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge the guarantee
or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte
_rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of_
such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such
guarantee or security interest was granted as a result of collusion between the debtor and the
beneficiary of such guarantee or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over
the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted
by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.

**Further Limitations on Enforcement**

Whether or not a Guarantor is subject to insolvency proceedings in The Netherlands, a guarantee or a
security document governed by Dutch law may be affected by, and a payment thereunder may be
withheld based on, the principles of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force
majeure (niet-toerekenbare _tekortkoming)_ and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden) and other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law. Other general_
defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be avoided on grounds of abuse of
circumstances (misbruik van omstandigheden), deceit (bedrog), intimidation (bedreiging) or mistake
(dwaling), the right to set off (verrekening) and the right to suspend performance (opschortingsrecht) or
dissolve (ontbinding) a contract if the other party is in default in respect of its obligations.

The validity, binding effect and enforceability of a guarantee may also be successfully contested by a
Dutch company (or its receiver in bankruptcy or administrator in a suspension of payments) on the
basis of an ultra vires claim. Such a claim will be successful if (i) the granting of a guarantee is ultra
_vires (i.e. exceeds the scope the entity’s objects or is not in the entity’s corporate interest) and (ii) the_
counterparty of such Dutch company under the relevant guarantee knew or should have known
(without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether the granting of such guarantee is ultra vires, the
Dutch courts would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the
company but all relevant circumstances including whether the company derives certain commercial
benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee was granted. If and to the extent that it
is determined that there is an imbalance, to the disadvantage of the company, between the value of the

295


-----

commercial benefit and the amount for which the company is held liable, then irrespective of the
wording of the objects clause in its articles of association the company (and any bankruptcy receiver or
administrator in suspension of payments) may contest the validity or enforceability of the act and it is
possible that such contestation will be honored by the Dutch courts. Benefit may, according to Dutch
case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence of the
interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is
relevant whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee, the continuity of such company
would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee. It remains possible that even if
such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it
appears that the granting of the guarantee cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s
objects. The foregoing applies mutatis mutandis to the acceptance of joint and several liability for, or
providing or agreeing to provide security for, obligations of a third party, whether or not affiliated, and
any other legal act having similar effect.

In connection with the removal of the prohibition on financial assistance for Dutch private companies
with limited liability as per October 1, 2012, it was mentioned in Dutch Parliament that the granting of
security, providing of a guarantee or accepting of liability with a view to the acquisition (or the
refinancing thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or
indirect) parent company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra vires act.
At present, there is no Dutch case law on this subject.

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may
be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of
10% or more of the shares in such company or who are entitled to an amount in shares or depositary
receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or such lesser amount as is provided by the
articles of association of such company. If the company has an issued share capital of at least
€22.5 million such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such
company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or depositary receipts
issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s
articles of association. A trade union and or other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association
of the relevant Dutch company may also submit a motion to the enterprise chamber for this purpose.
The guarantee or security itself may further be upheld by the enterprise chamber, yet actual payment
under it may be suspended or avoided.

**Germany**

**Insolvency**

Certain of the Guarantors will be limited liability companies (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung)
organized under the laws of Germany (such Guarantors are hereinafter referred to as the “German
Guarantors”). The German Guarantors and all other German providers of collateral organized under
the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are
located in Germany. Therefore, insolvency proceedings with regard to the German Guarantors and all
other German providers of collateral may be initiated in Germany if the German Guarantors or any of
the other German providers of collateral, respectively, were held to have their “centre of main interests”
within the territory of Germany at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed. German law would then govern those proceedings. Under certain
circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German
law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the
“centre of main interests” of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over German
Guarantors may be opened in other jurisdictions.

The insolvency and administrative laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the
insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to
obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your
ability to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of
Germany.

296


-----

Under German insolvency law, there is to date no group insolvency concept, which generally means
that, despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be
one separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an
insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be
legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within FFG. In particular, there is no
consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and also no
pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the German legislature passed an
act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von
_Konzerninsolvenzen), which will come into force on April 21, 2018. This act mainly provides for_
coordination and cooperation in connection with insolvency proceedings of group companies. This act
does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies,
or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency
Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may
assume jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single
person as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain
coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’
committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren)
and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the
ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event
of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its
debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), and, in addition, by the debtor on a voluntary
basis in the case of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). Pursuant to the relevant
provision of the German Insolvency Code, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the
value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is
predominantly likely (positive Fortführungsprognose).

If a company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder, such as the German
Guarantors, finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management of such
company and, in certain circumstances its shareholders, are obligated to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings without undue delay which may be deemed to be necessary no later than three
weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness objectively
occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations potentially exposes the management to both severe
damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company_
currently is able to service its payments obligations when they fall due, but will presumably not be able
to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. However, only the debtor,
and not the creditors, is entitled (but not obligated) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings due
to imminent illiquidity.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the
due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor
during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit
or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these
preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator
depend on the decision of the court and may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the
debtor’s property (which includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify
the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient
to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Upon appointment of the preliminary insolvency
administrator, the insolvency court may also order that the debtor can only dispose over its assets with
the consent of the preliminary insolvency administrator or the court may order that the power to
dispose over the assets shall fully pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency
court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor.

297


-----

As an alternative to preliminary proceedings, a debtor may petition for a debtor-in-possession
proceeding (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally
remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian
(Sachwalter)—with such decision being subject to, _inter_ _alia,_ the requirement that such
debtor-in-possession proceeding is not obviously futile.

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations and the number of its employees, the
insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger
_Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on the profile of the officeholder to be appointed or even to make_
a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the
preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the
court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). The
preliminary creditors’ committee also has the power to, _inter_ _alia,_ influence orders for
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung) and appointments for preliminary
trustees (Sachwalter). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all
creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large
and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees.

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover_
at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be
sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance
creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels
_Masse)._

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter)
(usually the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the
insolvency court, unless a debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession process, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the
assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors
(Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator
at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change
requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims) has voted
in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual
being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The
insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the
debtor’s business.

These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the
estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor
(with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available
collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to
participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights
they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. German insolvency
proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual
claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with
the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung)
brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency
proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any
security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured
creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the
security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the
insolvency administrator. In this context it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally
has the sole right to realize any movable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to
preferential rights (e.g. liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title
(Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment

298


-----

agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency
administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value
of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten)
which, in their statutory aggregate, add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any)
(unless the insolvency administrator successfully asserts higher enforcement costs or the creditors can
prove lower enforcement costs), are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant
collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the
debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate
(Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred
liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings).
Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims (Insolvenzforderungen)), in particular claims of
unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in
the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against
the estate have been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds resulting from the disposal of the
insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors (including the
unsecured claims of the holder of the Notes) of the Issuer, the German Guarantors or any other
German provider of collateral in full. In addition, it may take several years until such proceeds from the
insolvency estate (if any) are distributed to unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the
insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other
non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the debtor’s assets is realized by a piecemeal
sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the debtor’s business as a going concern, a different
approach aiming at the rehabilitation of the debtor can be taken based on an insolvency plan
(Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and
requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the debtor and the
consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. If the debtor is a corporate
entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in
the insolvency plan, e.g. these can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors
based on a debt-to-equity swap. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity
conversion. Under certain conditions, the debtor may also file for protective shield proceedings
(Schutzschirmverfahren). In such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit
enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets) and may implement other
preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement actions for up to three months if an
independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile
(offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. Given the relatively recent
enactment of these amendments, these provisions may not have been tested in practice and no
judicial precedents are available in such respect.

If the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency
reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to
initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession proceeding and can prove that a restructuring of
its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) the court may grant a period of up to
three months to utilize an insolvency plan for the debtor’s business. During this period, creditors’ rights
to enforce security may, upon petition of the filing debtor, be suspended. In these circumstances, the
insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is
entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on
the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian
(i.e., is obviously not competent or not impartial).

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to
be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless
privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of
a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency
proceedings rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors, provided they qualify as liabilities
of the estate itself (Masseverbindlichkeiten).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrators opt for performance.

299


-----

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement
upon the filing for or opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party or the occurrence
of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte
_oder Lösungsklauseln) are generally invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency_
administrator (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) whether or not to perform the contract unless they
reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also apply to agreements that are not
governed by German law.

**_Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer_**

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in the event that debtor-in
possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter)) may challenge (anfechten) transactions,
performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were
effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable hardening
periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully challenged by the
insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction,
performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or the
trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions
having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the German Guarantors or any other German
provider of collateral based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any
amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing credit support
for the benefit of the holders of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator under the rules of avoidance (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency
Code. In case the validity or enforceability of the Notes or any collateral in favor of the Notes is
challenged successfully, you may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes or the collateral.
If payments have already been made under the Notes or collateral, the insolvency administrator may
require that the recipients return the payment to the insolvency estate and you would instead then only
have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes
the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor may be challenged pursuant to the German Insolvency Code in the following
cases:

    - any legal act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be
challenged if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if at the time of the transaction the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), which means such debtor was unable to pay its debt when
due, and the creditor had knowledge thereof, or (ii) after a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings has been filed and the creditor had knowledge thereof or of the debtor
being illiquid (or knowledge of circumstances which imperatively (zwingend) suggested such
illiquidity or filing);

    - any legal act granting a creditor security or satisfaction for a debt to which such creditor had
no right, no right at the respective time or no right as to the respective manner, can be
challenged if the transaction was effected in the month prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings; if the transaction was effected in the second and third
month prior to the filing, it can be challenged if at the time of the transaction (i) the debtor was
illiquid or (ii) the creditor knew that the transaction would be detrimental to the creditors of the
debtor;

    - any legal transaction effected by the debtor which is directly detrimental to the creditors of the
debtor can be challenged if the transaction was effected (i) in the last three months prior to
the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings against the debtor, if at the
time of the legal transaction the debtor was illiquid and the other party to the legal transaction
had knowledge thereof or (ii) after a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings has
been filed against the debtor and the other party to the legal transaction had knowledge
thereof or of the debtor being illiquid;

300


-----

    - if a legal act whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt is regarded as having
been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), such gratuitous transaction can be challenged
unless it was effected earlier than four years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings against the debtor;

    - any legal act performed by the debtor during a period of ten years prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after such filing can be
challenged if the debtor acted with the intent to disadvantage its creditors and the beneficiary
of the transaction had knowledge of such intent at the time of the transaction, with such
knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the
transaction disadvantaged the other creditors—such period of time is four years in the event
that the relevant legal act provided security or satisfaction of the relevant creditor;

    - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party which
directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was
concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its
creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term
‘affiliated party’ includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or
supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s
share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to
information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons that are spouses,
relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

    - any legal act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment
of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or an economically equivalent claim can be
challenged (i) in the event it provided security, if the transaction was effected within the last
ten years prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter
or (ii) in the event it provided satisfaction, if the transaction was effected in the last year prior
to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter; or

    - any legal act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically
equivalent claim to a third party can be challenged if the transaction was effected in the last
year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and
if a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in
which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to
further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a subsidiary subject to the German
insolvency laws) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings has been filed, or that the legal act was detrimental to, or intended to
prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the
debtor’s intention to disadvantage the insolvency creditors if such person was aware of the debtor’s
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged the debtor’s
creditors.

Under German law, a creditor who provided additional or extended existing funding to a debtor or
obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time
such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Court of
Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with
the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of
the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary
of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the
guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with
respect thereto.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator challenging transactions pursuant to the
German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also avoid any security right or payment performed under the
relevant security right pursuant to the German Act on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal

301


-----

insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and
the hardening periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in
the courts.

If any Guarantee is challenged or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease
to have any claim in respect of the Guarantee and would have a claim solely under the Notes and the
remaining Guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged
would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.

Moreover, please note that pursuant to the amendments (“Gesetz _zur_ _Verbesserung_ _der_
_Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz vom_
_29. März 2017”) of the German Insolvency Code that came into force on 5 April 2017, among other_
things, the provisions for avoidance claims in connection with willful intent, for cash transactions
(Bargeschäfte) and the interest rates on avoidance claims have been amended.

Finally, the insolvency estate serves to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors
against the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims
are satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and in
accordance with the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty
payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency
proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the
proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such
incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money;
(iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a
loan replacing equity capital or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Collateral, the Guarantees and the Security_**
**_Interests_**

The security interests of the Security Agent may also be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of
ownership interests and pledges may be subject to certain specific requirements, and the Security
Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent
may be unable to obtain any such consent. The same applies in the context of any consent required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to
foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

Furthermore, the guarantees and security interests may be subject to certain limitations on
enforcement or may be limited by applicable law or may be subject to certain defenses that may limit
its validity or enforceability. Under German mandatory law, the granting and enforcement of security
and/or guarantees which secure indebtedness of a direct or indirect shareholder or sister company of a
security grantor incorporated in Germany or of a subsidiary of any such shareholder or sister company
in order to ensure the maintenance of share capital of a joint stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft),
limited liability company (Gesellschaft _mit_ _beschränkter_ _Haftung)_ or a limited partnership
(Kommanditgesellschaft) with a limited liability company as general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) is
subject to certain statutory capital maintenance limitations. As a general rule, the capital maintenance
rules prohibit the direct and indirect repayment (such term to include payments pursuant to guarantees
or security in favor of obligations of a direct or indirect shareholder) of registered share capital of a
German limited liability company to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of its net assets (i.e.
assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated
share capital (Stammkapital).

As a consequence, customary provisions will be included in, among others, the Indenture (so-called
“limitation language”) which, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions, limit the enforceability of
the respective guarantees and corresponding security interests addressing these statutory limitations
and liability risks pursuant to section 43 para. 3 German Limited Liability Companies Act (Gesetz
_betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) or section 93 para. 3 no. 6 German Stock_
Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz). This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or
security granted by a German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

302


-----

Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the jurisprudence of the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for
it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a
guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary of the Issuer. In such
case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.

Notwithstanding that the incurrence of the Guarantees by (German) direct or indirect subsidiaries of the
Issuer should, as of the date thereof, not result in any illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of such German
Guarantor, the enforcement limitations agreed in the Indenture also contain certain provisions limiting
an enforcement in connection with a potential liquidity shortfall of the relevant German Guarantor. This
may further limit (or exclude entirely) the ability to enforce the respective Guarantee or security granted
by the relevant German Guarantor.

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules are subject to
evolving jurisprudence. Future court rulings may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of
their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of German
(direct or indirect) subsidiaries of the Issuer to make payment on Guarantees or of the beneficiaries of
the guarantees to enforce the guarantees.

Finally, there is no legal precedent whether or not the contractual provisions limiting the enforcement of
the guarantee or security interests, including the adjustments of certain balance sheet items (as
provided for in the Indenture, the Senior Credit Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement) or similar
provisions will be held by a German court to be in compliance with the statutory capital maintenance
rules.

With respect to accessory security (akzessorische Sicherheit) expressed to be governed by German
law (such as pledges over shares, partnership interests, receivables or bank accounts), due to certain
legal requirements governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such
security interests it is imperative that the pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim is the same
person. Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee which does
not itself hold the secured claim. Even more, such accessory security is dependent on the secured
obligations and will automatically lapse upon payment, settlement or novation (Novation) of the
secured obligations. In order to overcome these legal obstacles in relation to German law accessory
security the Collateral secures a so-called “parallel debt” obligation created under the Intercreditor
Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes or, as applicable, the obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee directly. The parallel debt is
in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes or,
as applicable, the relevant Guarantor under its Guarantee (the “Principal Obligations”), and any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any
payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The
pledges governed by German law will directly and exclusively (to the extent the Notes are concerned)
secure the parallel debt owed to the Security Agent only rather than the obligations owed under the
Notes or to the holders of the Notes directly. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the
parallel debt under the Intercreditor Agreement, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the
full amount payable on the Notes or, as applicable, the relevant Guarantee, the parallel debt construct
has not yet been tested in German courts, and we cannot assure you that it will eliminate or mitigate
the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of the security interest. Similar concerns would apply for any
future pledgee concept included in the relvant pledge agreement. If any challenge to the validity of
such security interest or the parallel debt structure were successful, holders of the Notes might not be
able to recover any amounts in respect of such security interests. Therefore, the ability of the Security
Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted.

Furthermore, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy
of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in
enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral.

Under German mandatory law, the value of collateral transferred or assigned for security purposes
must not be excessive. Due to German mandatory law, security grantors may have a right to claim the
release of certain collateral in case of a subsequent over-collateralization (nachträgliche

303


-----

_Übersicherung) (where the value of the relevant security interest subsequently significantly and not_
only temporarily exceeds the amount of the secured obligations), or security interests can even be
deemed void in case of an initial excessive over-collateralization (anfängliche Übersicherung). As a
general rule, the value of collateral should not exceed the amount of the secured obligations by more
than 50%. A security transfer or assignment violating this rule either in itself or in combination with
other security interests will be deemed void if the violation exists at the time the collateral is granted. If
the ratio is exceeded later as a result of partial prepayment or of progressing repayment of the secured
obligations, the security grantor is entitled to a corresponding ratable release of the collateral. There is
no clear authority as to how the ratio has to be applied in the context of a financing involving several
companies and to what extent accessory forms of collateral (i.e., account pledges, claim pledges and
share or interest pledges) granted for the same obligations have to be taken into account. While the
German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) does the calculation on a case-by-case basis,
some legal authors estimate that an initial over-collateralization is given if the realization value of the
security exceeds the aggregate amount of secured claims.

Furthermore, under conflict of laws rules, the enforceability of an assignment against the obligor of the
assigned right will typically be governed by the law applicable to the assigned right. As long as the
obligor of an assigned claim is not aware of the assignment, such third-party debtor is entitled to
assume that the assignor is still the creditor (e.g. the claim will extinguish if and to the extent that the
debtor pays the assignor with discharging effect). Moreover, the assignability of a claim governed by
German law may be limited because of the nature of the assigned claim or as a result of an agreement
between the creditor and the obligor thereof. Although pursuant to section 354a of the German
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) a contractual agreement cannot validly preclude an
assignment if the assigned claim results from a transaction entered into between two commercial
parties, any payment with discharging effect on such claim to the assignor will extinguish such claim in
a corresponding amount.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the
sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which
certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the
security interest in the collateral gives the security agent the right to prevent other creditors of the
entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the
collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority
(according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset
constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay
on proceedings initiated by other creditors). Finally, the provision of Guarantees and execution of the
Collateral will be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles that could relieve certain Guarantors or
security providers of the obligation to provide guarantees and/or grant security interests in assets
otherwise expected to form part of the Collateral, which could have a material adverse impact on the
credit support available to you in connection with your investment in the Notes.

**United Kingdom**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in in England and Wales (each a “UK Guarantor”).
Accordingly, an English court may conclude that the UK Guarantors have their “centre of main
interests”, within the meaning of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, in England and, therefore, that
insolvency proceedings in England constituting “main insolvency proceedings” under Article 3(1) of the
New EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in respect of a UK Guarantor. In the event that a
UK Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
insolvency or similar proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales (“UK Insolvency Proceedings”)
may be initiated in a number of ways, including by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its
creditors making an application to court for entry into administration, (ii) the company, its directors, or
certain creditors (discussed below) appointing administrators out of court, or (iii) a creditor filing a
petition to wind-up the company or the company resolving to wind itself up (in the case of liquidation).
A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it
is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve
one of three statutory purposes (as described below).

304


-----

Under the Insolvency Act 1986 as amended (the “UK Insolvency Act”), a company is deemed to be
unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (i.e. it is proved to the satisfaction of the
court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (i.e. it
is provided to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the
amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or, among other
matters, if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified
time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order).

Although the following content includes certain details of how secured creditors (and secured assets)
of a UK Guarantor would rank and be dealt with in UK Insolvency Proceedings of a UK Guarantor, it
should be noted that, as at the Issue Date at least, the guarantee obligations of each UK Guarantor are
unsecured.

**Overview of UK Insolvency Proceedings**

**Liquidation**

**_Priority of Claims in a UK Liquidation_**

In a liquidation of any UK Guarantor, the order of priorities is such that debts due from it to any holders
of fixed charges over its assets are paid first out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to such
fixed charges (subject to the prior payment of the costs of preservation and realization of the fixed
charge assets). Where there are floating charges, liquidation expenses (discussed further below),
preferential creditors, and unsecured creditors to the extent of the “ring-fenced” fund (also discussed
further below) may (to the extent the other unsecured assets of the UK Guarantor are insufficient to
discharge them) be paid out of the proceeds of realization of assets subject to those floating charges in
priority to payments to creditors secured by virtue of those floating charges. Thereafter, any debts
owing to holders of the floating charges would be paid to the extent they are secured by that charge.
The categories of preferential debts include certain amounts payable in respect of occupational
pension schemes relating to contributions due but unpaid and employee remuneration up to a specified
amount. A certain part of the net proceeds of the realization of the assets covered by a floating charge
(up to a maximum of £600,000) would be “ring-fenced” and made available pro rata to unsecured
creditors. Provable debts of unsecured creditors which are not preferential debts and are not covered
by the ring-fenced fund (if any) would be paid from the proceeds of realizations of unsecured assets (if
any) and, after the secured liabilities have been met, from the proceeds of realization of relevant
secured assets.

**Liquidation Expenses**

The UK Insolvency Act broadly states that in a liquidation of a company the expenses of the liquidation
rank first for payment out of the debtor’s unsecured assets and ahead of the claims of unsecured
creditors. In addition, where the assets available for payment of its general creditors (excluding any
amount ring-fenced for unsecured debts as described above) are not sufficient to meet the liquidation
expenses, those liquidation expenses can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject
to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’
claims.

**Administration**

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the UK Insolvency Act pursuant to which a company
may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company
may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. Broadly
speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the
application of, among others, the company itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including
contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the
company also has the right to appoint an administrator. In addition, he has the right to intervene in an
application made for administration proceeding by another person by nominating an alternative
administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the
appointment of an administrative receiver.

An administrator may only be appointed (either by a court or via the out-of court process) if there is
sufficient evidence (which varies depending on the method of appointment) including that (a) the

305


-----

company proposed to be the subject of the administration is or is likely to become “unable to pay its
debts” and (b) the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of the statutory objectives of
administration. Administration proceedings are supposed to achieve one of three objectives that must
be considered successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably
practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than if the company went
into immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests
of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a
distribution to secured or preferential creditors.

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration
order (in the case of a court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (in the
case of an out of court appointment) is made. At the commencement of the appointment of an
administrator, a full statutory moratorium applies, pursuant to which no creditor can take any action
against that company, including, among other things, commencing a legal process against the
company, winding up the company or enforcing security or repossessing goods in the company’s
possession under a hire purchase or similar agreement, without the permission of the court or (in the
case of a full moratorium) the consent of the administrator.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over
that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the
disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally,
cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under
the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

Subject to the above points, were a UK Guarantor to enter administration, whilst any principal debt or
guarantee obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action
could be taken in respect of any failure to pay.

**Expenses of the Administration**

Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify as expenses of the administration (and which include, among
others, expenses properly incurred by the administrator in performing his functions in the
administration and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration) enjoy priority
status, in a similar way to liquidation expenses (as described above) although the categories of
expenses are slightly different. In particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the
realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of
preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims.

Where a corporate rescue is not possible, administration can be used as a proceeding in which to
make distributions to creditors like a liquidation in which case claims of creditors may be submitted to
the administrator, although court approval (and the conversion of the administration from a rescue
proceeding to a liquidating administration) will generally be required before he can make a distribution
to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be set for receipt and processing of claims before interim
dividends are paid.

As with liquidation, as described above, where an administration moves into the liquidation phase, an
administrator will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of
enforcement of a floating charge security (if any) for the benefit of unsecured creditors up to a
maximum of £600,000 (and after making full provision for preferential creditors and administration
expenses out of those floating charge realizations).

**Small Companies Moratorium**

Certain “small companies” may, for the purposes of putting together proposals for a company voluntary
arrangement, seek court protection from their creditors by way of a “moratorium” for a period of up to
28 days, with the option for creditors to extend this protection for up to a further two months (although
the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy may, by order, extend or reduce
the duration of either period).

A “small company” is defined for these purposes by reference to whether the company meets certain
tests relating to a company’s balance sheet, total turnover and average number of employees in a

306


-----

particular period (although the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy may, by
order, modify the moratorium eligibility qualifications and the definition of a “small company”).

During the period for which a moratorium is in force in relation to a small company, among other things,
no winding up may be commenced (except in very limited circumstances, for example where the
UK Secretary of State considers it to be in the public interest to do so) or administrator or
administrative receiver appointed to that company, no security created by that company over its
property may be enforced (except (1) with the leave of the Court or (2) in the case of eligible financial
collateral arrangements under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 where
the requirement to get a court order before enforcing security over small companies will not apply), no
other proceedings or legal process may be commenced or continued against that company (except
with the leave of the Court) and the company’s ability to make payments in respect of debts and
liabilities existing at the date of the filing for the moratorium is curtailed. Certain small companies may,
however, be excluded from being eligible for a moratorium (although the Secretary of State for
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy may, by regulations, modify such exclusions). As the law
currently stands, companies that on the date of filing are party to an agreement which is or forms part
of a capital market arrangement are excluded from being eligible for this small companies moratorium.

**Possible Challenges to Security Interests and Guarantees**

**Vulnerable Transactions**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company would have certain powers to
apply to court to challenge transactions entered into by a company if that company is unable to pay its
debts (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act) at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its
debts as a result of the transaction (see above for a description of when a company may be deemed
unable to pay its debts). The following grounds for challenge under English insolvency law apply to
guarantees and security interests. They do not purport to be an exhaustive list of all possible grounds
for challenge which apply to security interests as it is not contemplated, as the Issue Date, that any UK
Guarantor will grant any security interests in connection with the Notes

**Transactions at an undervalue.**

A transaction (such as a UK Guarantor’s grant of a guarantee) might be challenged in this way (as a
transaction at an undervalue) if it involved the company making a gift or otherwise entering into a
transaction on terms that it received no consideration, or the company received significantly less value
under the transaction than it gave in return. Where an undervalue transaction is proved, the court has
powers to make any order it thinks fit in order to restore the position to what it would have been had
that company not entered into that transaction. A court should not intervene, however, if it is satisfied
that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its
business and if, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would
benefit the company. The court can set aside transactions at an undervalue entered into by the
company within a period of two years ending with the onset of its insolvency (see “—Onset of
_Insolvency”). The order could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any_
guarantees although there is protection for a third party that acquires an interest in property or benefits
from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value without notice of the relevant circumstances.
In principle, a Guarantee granted by a UK Guarantor could be challenged as a transaction at an
undervalue.

**Preferences**

A transaction might also be challenged as a preference where a company has done something or
suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or guarantor in a better
position than the one that person would otherwise have been in the event of the company going into
insolvent liquidation. If a transaction is found to have given a preference to a creditor, surety or
guarantor of the company, then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position
to what it would have been if the company had not given that preference (which could include reducing
payments under guarantees or setting aside guarantees although there is protection for a third party
that acquires an interest in property or benefits from the transaction and which has acted in good faith
for value without notice of the relevant circumstances). A court should not intervene however when the

307


-----

company, in deciding to give the preference, was not influenced by a desire to put the person who was
given the preference in a better position in the event of insolvent liquidation of the company. If the
preference is given to a person connected to the company (other than an employee), the court can
look back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of two years from the date of the
onset of insolvency. If the person is not connected to the company, the court can only look back and
set aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the onset of insolvency.

**Extortionate Credit Transactions**

Further, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit
transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to
three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation.
A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit,
the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise
grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. If a transaction entered into by a company is
found to be an extortionate credit transaction, the court can make one or more orders specified in the
UK Insolvency Act, including an order setting aside the whole or any part of any obligation created by
the extortionate credit transaction, an order varying the terms of the extortionate credit transaction or
an order requiring any person to pay to the administrator or liquidator any sums paid to that person, by
virtue of the extortionate credit transaction by the relevant company.

As a result of the rights to challenge described above, in the event that a UK Guarantor becomes
unable to pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the issuance of the Notes (or three years if
the Notes or any related transaction are found to be an extortionate credit transaction), an
administrator or liquidator is appointed to it and the conditions contemplated in the relevant legal
provisions are met, the provision of the relevant Guarantee may be challenged by a liquidator or
administrator or a court may set aside the granting of the Guarantee as invalid.

**Onset of Insolvency**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences
depends on the insolvency procedure in questions. In administration the onset of insolvency is that
date on which (a) the court application for an administration order is issued, or (b) the notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court, or (c) otherwise, the date on which the
appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the
date on which the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the
date on which the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration,
the onset of insolvency will be as for the initial administration.

**Limitation on Enforcement**

The grant of a Guarantee by any UK Guarantor in respect of the obligations of another group company
must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the
respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. Further, corporate benefit must be
established for each UK Guarantor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers,
in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the UK Guarantor for the benefit of its
members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient
commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors. In the case of either a
company exceeding the powers and authorities under its memorandum and articles of association or
the directors entering into a transaction which has no corporate benefit, there is the risk that the grant
of the guarantee could be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some
comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with a UK Guarantor in good faith, however
the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation.

**Transaction Defrauding Creditors**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was
made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a

308


-----

claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim
which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a
transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction
may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of
being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in
administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. The challenge
must be made within 12 years (or in the case of claims for a sum of money, six years) from the date on
which the cause of action arose. The relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the
transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the
court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the
transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The
relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not
he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice
any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value
and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not require a person who received a benefit
from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay
any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**Foreign currency**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their
debts, any debt of a company payable in a currency other than pound sterling (such as any debt
arising under the Notes or any guarantee thereof) must be converted into pound sterling at the “official
exchange rate” prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation or administration (if the
administration was immediately preceded by a winding up, on the date the company went into
liquidation). This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The “official exchange rate”
for these purposes is the middle exchange rate on the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of
business, as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court
determines.

**Disposition in winding up**

Any disposition of a UK Guarantor’s property made after a compulsory winding-up has commenced is,
unless the court orders otherwise, void. The compulsory winding up of a company is deemed to
commence when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the
date on which the court makes the winding-up order (if any).

**Post-petition interest**

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes (or a Guarantor’s guarantee
of the Notes) in respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation
proceedings in respect of a UK Guarantor would only be recoverable by the Noteholders from that UK
Guarantor out of any surplus remaining after payment of all other debts provided in the proceedings of
the UK Guarantor and accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of the
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to
purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes. The sale
will be made pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) between, inter alios, the
Issuer and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as
representatives of the Initial Purchasers. The Initial Purchasers of the Euro Notes are Credit Suisse
Securities (Europe) Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, KKR Capital Markets Limited, BNP
Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank
plc, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, Lloyds Bank plc, Mizuho International plc, RBC Europe Limited,
Société Générale and UniCredit Bank AG, and the Initial Purchasers of the Dollar Notes are Credit
Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, KKR Capital Markets Limited,
BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC
Bank plc, ING Bank N.V., London Branch, Lloyds Bank plc, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, RBC Capital
Markets, LLC, Société Générale and UniCredit Bank AG.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the
Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any
of them are purchased.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes to purchasers at the price to investors indicated on
the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the Initial
Purchasers may from time to time vary the offering price and other selling terms without notice. To the
extent that any of the Initial Purchasers are not U.S.-registered broker dealers, they will only offer and
sell Notes in the United States through U.S.-registered broker dealers or affiliates, as appropriate. In
addition, the Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes outside the U.S. through certain of their
affiliates.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments which the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of any such liabilities. The Issuer will pay the
Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain expenses of the offering of the Notes. The Issuer and
the Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any securities of, or
guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that have a tenor of more than one year (other than
the Notes) during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date
that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the
representatives of the Initial Purchasers.

No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit
a public offering of the Notes and the Guarantees, or the possession, circulation or distribution of this
Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action
for that purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or
advertisements in connection with the Notes or the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from
any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such
country or jurisdiction.

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell
in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession
this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about, and to observe, any
restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and
resales of the Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. The Issuer has been
advised by the Initial Purchasers that the Initial Purchasers intend to make a market in the Notes but

310


-----

are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active_
_trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

The Stabilization Manager may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions and covering
transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales
in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Stabilization Manager. Stabilizing
transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not
exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open
market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.

The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at
any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the
Notes. These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be
higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the
open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to
cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Stabilization Manager of a
greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering of the Notes. Stabilizing
transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a
decline in the market price of the Notes while the offering of the Notes is in progress.

These activities by the Stabilization Manager, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers for
their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a
result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open
market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the Initial Purchasers at any
time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes,
and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to
the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Notes (including the Guarantees) have not been and will not be registered under the
U.S. Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold except (i) to QIBs in offers and sales that occur
within the United States, in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule 144A; and (ii) in offers and sales that occur outside the United
States, in reliance on Regulation S, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state
or territory of the United States or any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, each Initial Purchaser has
represented and agreed that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any of the Notes
(including the Guarantees) as part of its allocation at any time other than to QIBs in the United States
in accordance with Rule 144A or outside of the United States in accordance with Regulation S.
Transfer of the Notes (including the Guarantees) will be restricted and each purchaser of the Notes
(including the Guarantees) in the United States will be required to make certain acknowledgements,
representations and agreements, as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

    - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the
Guarantors;

    - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom;
and

    - any Notes will only be offered in the Netherlands to qualified investors (as defined in the

Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht).

-----

Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are
broker-dealers registered under the Exchange Act.

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about the date specified
on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which is ten business days following the date of this
Offering Memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the
Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven successive business days will be required, by virtue of
the fact that the Notes will initially settle ten business days following the date of pricing of the Notes, to
specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the
future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Issuer and its
affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Each of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and
have provided commitments under the bridge facility that the Issuer has entered into as borrower to
provide financing for the Acquisition in the event the Offering is not consummated, and such entities
may act as counterparties in the hedging arrangements the Issuer expects to enter into in connection
with the Transactions, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities.

Funds advised by KKR that indirectly own an equity interest in the Issuer are affiliates of KKR Capital
Markets Limited, which is acting as an Initial Purchaser in connection with the offering of the Notes.
KKR Capital Markets Limited may therefore be deemed to be our affiliate and have a conflict of interest
with us.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of
ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that
they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or
their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration available under the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of the Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a Dutch company. The Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of the
Netherlands, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom. Although the Issuer and the
Guarantors have agreed, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, to accept service of process in
the United States through agents designated for such purpose, it may not be possible for holders of the
Notes to (a) effect service of process upon the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective directors or
officers, or (b) enforce judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability of
such entities or persons under the U.S. federal securities laws and state securities laws or other laws
against any such entities or persons in the courts of a foreign jurisdiction.

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat
in the Netherlands. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be
enforceable in the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment
obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether
or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In
order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated
before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same
judgment without relitigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with
the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde)
of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally acceptable
ground, and (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the
same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a
non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause,
provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable
treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments
will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and
impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon
U.S. federal securities laws.

**Germany**

Civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the Unites States may, either in an original
action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts, not be enforceable in Germany.
The enforceability of U.S. judgments in Germany is subject to an action to be brought before a German
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the procedures set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in
civil and commercial matters. Consequently, under applicable legal rules, a final judgment for payment
given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws,
would not automatically be enforceable in Germany.

However, under current rules as presently applied by German courts, a final and conclusive judgment
by a U.S. court for a definite sum of money, will be recognized and thereby given binding effect within
the territory of Germany, unless the German court finds that, inter alia, the recognition of the U.S.
judgment leads to a result manifestly irreconcilable with material principles of German law or that
proper legal procedures have not been observed. Specifically, the recognition and enforcement of the
U.S. judgment by a German court is to be denied if one or more of the following circumstances exist:

    - U.S. courts would not have had jurisdiction over the case based on the principles on
jurisdictional competences under German law; or

323


-----

    - the defendant did not appear in the proceedings and invokes such lack of appearance, and
the document introducing the proceedings was not duly made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; or

    - the judgment conflicts with (i) any prior judgment rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior
judgment rendered by another foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany; or (iii) the
proceedings leading to such foreign judgment are irreconcilable with previously pending
proceedings in a German court; or

    - the recognition of the judgment by the U.S. court would be in conflict with German public
policy, including the fundamental principles of German law, and in particular the civil liberties
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); or

    - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is not guaranteed.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities, such as the holders of the Notes, may be able to
enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts. We cannot,
however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, it is
doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. In particular, the obligations need to be of a
specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Enforcement is
also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or
moratorium, as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally.

It should be noted that German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of punitive
damages as incompatible with the fundamental principles of German law. Moreover, a German court
may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent
that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. As far as
the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may compel
the extensive production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses prior
to trial. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No
equivalent pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor a final U.S. judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United
States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be
regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment
relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment inconsistent
with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the
United Kingdom are both parties to the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Arbitral Awards). Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United
States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would
not be directly enforceable in England and Wales and is subject to the common law rules of
enforcement. In order to enforce any such judgment in England and Wales, proceedings must be
initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in
England and Wales. In this type of action, an English court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of
the original matter decided by a U.S. court and/or enforce a judgment, provided that:

    - the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction (under English rules of private international law) to give
the judgment or the judgment is not final or conclusive;

    - the original judgment is final and conclusive on the merits of the claim and is for a definite
sum of money (and is not payable in respect of a tax, fine or penalty);

    - the enforcement of such judgment would not contravene public policy, a statute in England or
the European Convention on Human Rights;

324


-----

    - the original judgment is not for multiple damages;

    - the original judgment is not inconsistent with a prior judgment on the same subject matter and
between the same parties;

    - the English proceedings were commenced within the relevant limitation period;

    - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question were not the
subject of a judgment of an English court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment
is enforceable in England;

    - the original judgment has been not obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles
of natural justice were breached;

    - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was not contrary to an agreement under
which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to
whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit), for example by way of arbitration or
proceedings in a different court;

    - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was not contrary to an agreement that
any dispute would be settled by reference to a different governing law than applied by the
U.S. court;

    - no order has been made that remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments
(Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 applying that section to U.S. courts including the relevant
U.S. court; and

    - no relevant power has been exercised by the United Kingdom Government pursuant to
section 5(4) of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980.

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment
will create an obligation which can be enforced as a debt in fresh legal proceedings. It may be
necessary to serve the proceedings out of the jurisdiction, and parties must consider whether it is
necessary to obtain the permission of the court to do so. It may not be possible to obtain an English
judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar
proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in the manner described above.

It is, however, uncertain whether an English court would impose liability on FFG in an action predicated
upon U.S. federal securities law brought in England and Wales.

Operating profit includes certain indirect central costs and general corporate expenses (note 3) that
have been allocated to the Spreads Business on the basis that it operated as part of the wider Unilever
Group. These allocations have been determined on a basis that both Unilever and the Spreads
Business consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilisation of services provided to, or the benefit
received by, the Spreads Business during the periods presented. Had the Spreads Business operated
independently during the periods presented the level of costs incurred would have been influenced by
a number of factors including the chosen organisation structure, the functions that are outsourced as
opposed to performed by employees, and by other strategic decisions made in areas such as
information technology and infrastructure.

The tax charge has been made using an effective tax rate that is appropriate to circumstances in each
individual country. The tax charges recorded in the income statement may not necessarily be
representative of the charges that may arise in the future.

(a) Income tax paid represents the amount of current tax charged for the year, which is deemed immediately settled through the
statement of changes in net parent (deficit) / investment.

(b) In 2015 aspects of the Spreads Business were restructured into a newly created Baking, Cooking and Spreads (‘BCS’)
group of legal entities. The restructuring involved the transfer at fair value of Spreads related trade, assets and liabilities
amounting to a total of € 2,612.1 million. In some countries BCS entities drew down loans from Unilever Finance
International AG amounting to a total of € 1,289.9 million to satisfy the purchase of Spreads net assets. In other countries
the transfers of Spreads net assets to local BCS entities did not involve settlements in cash and were effected through other
restructuring mechanisms as allowed under local regulations (e.g. demerger; share transfer or contribution; assets
distributions). This restructuring had no impact on the BCS assets and liabilities reflected in these combined carve-out
financial statements as they are reported at historical cost, except for the recognition of deferred tax balances arising from
changes in certain underlying tax bases as discussed in note 6A. As at 31 December 2015, the related party loans with
Unilever Finance International AG are recognised as financial liabilities (refer to note 19) and the cash remitted on
restructuring to other legal entities within Unilever is disclosed as a movement in net parent (deficit)/ investment.

(c) As Unilever uses a centralised approach to cash management and financing its operations, transactions between Unilever
and the Spreads Business are accounted for through net parent (deficit) / investment. Accordingly none of the cash, cash
equivalents, debt or related interest income and expense at the corporate level have been assigned to the Spreads
Business, with the exception of cash, debt and related interest held by BCS legal entities. The Other transactions with

F-7


-----

Unilever and non-controlling interests reflect the fact that the Spreads Business does not retain cash generated from
operating activities and represents the cash outflow associated with repatriating such cash to Unilever, net of any
movements in working capital, financing and investing activities.

(d) On 1 July 2017 USCC AG transferred 100% of the profit rights relating to BCS to BCS Europe BV for consideration of
€ 523 million. This acquisition was funded by a € 523 million loan from Unilever Finance International AG. This loan
transaction is shown as a cash inflow from additional related party loans with Unilever. The acquisition is shown as a cash
outflow within other transactions with Unilever and owners of non-controlling interests. On 15 Nov 2017, UNUS Holdings BV
injected € 523 million of capital into BCS Europe BV (via a number of Spreads intermediary holding companies) which was
used to settle the loan with Unilever Finance International AG. No cash transferred as part of this transaction.

**1. BASIS OF PREPARATION, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

**BACKGROUND**

**Unilever**

The two ultimate parent companies, Unilever N.V. (“NV”) and Unilever PLC (“PLC”), together with their
group companies, operate as a single economic entity (“Unilever” or the “Group”). Unilever is one of
the world’s largest consumer goods companies. Its products are segmented into Foods, Refreshments,
Home care, and Personal care; it is also the world’s largest producer of food spreads (a distinct
product category within the Foods segment).

**The Transaction**

Unilever announced on 15 December 2017 that it has received a binding offer from KKR & Co.
L.P. (“KKR”) to purchase its global spreads business (the “Spreads Business” or “Spreads”) for
€ 6.825 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis (the “Transaction”). The offer is subject to certain
regulatory approvals and employee consultation in certain jurisdictions. Completion of the Transaction
is expected mid-2018.

The Transaction, and accordingly these combined financial statements, excludes the South Africa
spreads business. South African operations were disposed of as part of a separate, stand-alone sale.

The Spreads Business includes brands such as Becel, Flora, Country Crock, Blue Band, I Can’t
Believe It’s Not Butter, Rama and ProActiv, together with other minor non-spreads elements of
Unilever’s Foods segment (primarily comprised of the industrial oils business in Mexico and Turkey
and of the olive oil business in Greece). It operates across 66 countries around the world. The
individual brands and related product categories that are being sold to KKR are listed in note 20.

**THE SPREADS BUSINESS**

The Spreads Business is not operated on a worldwide basis from within separate legal entity
structures. During the year 2015 however aspects of the Spreads Business were restructured into a
newly created Baking, Cooking and Spreads (‘BCS’) group of legal entities in certain regions of the
world (most of Europe and North America). The BCS legal entities combined and carved-out in these
financial statements are listed in note 21. Furthermore, the supply chain companies, factories, and
marketing and sales organisations operated by Unilever run both Spreads and non-spreads activities.

These financial statements have therefore been prepared on a combined and carve-out basis from
Unilever’s consolidated financial statements for the purpose of presenting the financial position, results
of operations and cash flows of the Spreads Business as set out in the Basis of Preparation section
below.

These combined carve-out financial statements include every territory in which Unilever operates its
Spreads Business, except for South Africa.

**BASIS OF PREPARATION**

These combined carve-out financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and
under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated, and present the financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of the Spreads Business for each of the three years ended
31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 and as at these dates. An opening
combined balance sheet as at 1 January 2015 has also been presented.

These combined carve-out financial statements have been prepared in accordance with this basis of
preparation, which is consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU
and as issued by the IASB, except as set out below:

- IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as issued by the IASB do not provide for the preparation of
combined carve-out financial statements and accordingly in preparing these combined carve-out

F-10


-----

financial statements certain accounting conventions commonly used for the preparation of
historical financial information for inclusion in investment circulars as described in the Annexure to
SIR 2000 (Investment Reporting Standard applicable to public reporting engagements on historical
financial information) issued by the UK Auditing Practices Board have been applied. Further
details on the application of these accounting conventions can be found below.

These combined carve-out financial statements:

- Have been prepared by combining and carving-out the assets, liabilities, income and expenses
that the directors have determined relate to the Spreads Business. Those amounts have been
derived from the underlying financial records of the Unilever entities running Spreads activities,
which also include recharges by Unilever of indirect central costs and general corporate expenses.
The underlying financial records of Unilever are maintained in accordance with EU and IASB
IFRS;

- Include a cash flow statement showing movements arising from operating, investing and financing
activities irrespective of Unilever’s centralised approach to cash management and financing; and

- Disclose the cumulative investment of Unilever in the Spreads Business as net parent (deficit) /
investment.

The assets, liabilities, income and expenses that the directors have determined relate to the Spreads
Business include all those that are directly attributable and/or separately identifiable to the Spreads
Business, together with an allocation of the items that are not. The following estimates, judgements
and assumptions have been made for the purpose of allocating items to the combined carve-out
financial statements that are not directly attributable and/or separately identifiable.

Balance sheet items:

- Property, plant and equipment includes:

   - land and buildings related to factories and sites shared between the Spreads Business and
other parts of Unilever only where those land and buildings (or share of those land and
buildings) are transferring to KKR as part of the Transaction;

   - plant and machinery at the above sites where directly attributable to Spreads or, where
shared, in proportion to its estimated use by the Spreads Business based on production cost
ratios; and

   - plant and machinery at other sites that are not transferring to KKR where directly attributable
to Spreads.

- Where trade receivables held by Unilever relate to spreads and non-spreads products, Spreads
trade receivables have been estimated in each country for the top 20 Spreads customers by
applying the ratio of spreads sales over total sales to total receivables for each of those
customers. The remaining balance has been estimated by applying the same ratio after excluding
sales from those top 20 customers.

- Where trade payables held by Unilever relate to spreads and non-spreads purchases, Spreads
trade payables have been estimated using the proportion of the Spreads Business cost of sales
and administrative expenses compared to total Unilever cost of sales and administrative expenses
in each country.

- Commodity and foreign exchange derivatives are held by Unilever and have been estimated as
follows:

   - Commodity derivatives: in proportion to the commodities used by the Spreads Business; and

   - Foreign exchange derivatives: using the proportion of Spreads Business usage compared to
total Unilever usage.

- As Unilever uses a centralised approach to cash management and financing its operations,
transactions between Unilever and the Spreads Business are accounted for through net parent
(deficit) / investment. Accordingly, none of the cash, cash equivalents, debt or related interest
income and expense at the corporate level have been assigned to the Spreads Business, with the
exception of cash, debt and related interest held by BCS legal entities.

F-11


-----

- Current tax balances in BCS legal entities form part of the Spreads Business’ current liabilities.
Tax amounts allocated from the Unilever Group to Spreads activities operated outside of BCS
legal entities (see income statement items below) have been reflected in the combined balance
sheet as changes in net parent (deficit) / investment.

- Intercompany receivables from, and payables to, other parts of Unilever that are supported by loan
agreements have been presented as financial assets / liabilities; other balances have been
presented as part of trade receivables / payables.

Income statement items:

- Operating costs reflect amortisation and depreciation charges relating to intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment included in the combined carve-out balance sheet (see balance
sheet items above), and an allocation of amortisation and depreciation charges for those software
and buildings utilised by the Spreads Business but not included in the combined carve-out balance
sheet (separately disclosed as “allocated” amortisation or depreciation in note 3). Allocated
amortisation and depreciation have been estimated by reference to the proportion of Spreads
revenue compared to total Unilever revenue.

- Indirect central costs (primarily related to the sales force, general marketing and merchandising)
and general corporate expenses (primarily related to finance, legal, information technology, human
resources, communications, and audit) incurred by Unilever are systematically recharged to
Spreads business units as management charges in accordance with Unilever’s historical internal
methodology. These management charges are recharged by Unilever on the basis of direct usage
when identifiable or based on as a proportion of revenue, adjusted on a line-by-line basis to reflect
specific local circumstances, when not. These recharged costs and expenses:

   - are deemed to have been settled by the Spreads Business to Unilever in the period in which
these costs were accrued; and

   - are influenced by the management and recharge arrangements that existed within the
Unilever Group and are not necessarily representative of the future level of costs for the
Spreads Business as it will exist upon completion of the Transaction.

- The tax charge is a combination of the tax charges recorded in BCS legal entities and an
allocation of the tax charges recorded in Unilever that are associated with Spreads operations not
recorded within BCS legal entities. The allocation has been made using an effective tax rate that is
appropriate to circumstances in each individual country. The tax charges recorded in the
combined carve-out income statement may not be representative of the charges that may arise in
the future.

These combined carve-out financial statements apply consistently, unless otherwise stated, the
accounting policies and the material estimates and judgements made that are disclosed in the
accounting policies and in the critical accounting estimates and judgements sections below.

These combined carve-out financial statements do not necessarily reflect the Spreads Business
financial position, results of operations or cash flows had the Spreads Business been a separate entity,
or the future results of the Spreads Business as it will exist upon completion of the Transaction.

**BASIS OF COMBINATION**

These combined carve-out financial statements combine the results, assets and liabilities, and cash
flows of the Spreads Business by applying the principles underlying the consolidation procedures
relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions under IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial
Statements’ for each of the three years ended 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and
31 December 2015 and as at these dates.

**ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

Accounting policies are included in the relevant notes to the combined carve-out financial statements.
These are presented as text highlighted in grey throughout these combined carve-out financial
statements. The accounting policies stated below have been applied throughout these combined
carve-out financial statements.

F-12


-----

**Foreign Currencies**

These combined carve-out financial statements are presented in millions of euros (‘€’).

Items included in the financial statements of individual Spreads Business companies or operations are
recorded in their respective functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which each entity operates.

Foreign currency transactions in individual Spreads Business companies or operations are translated
into functional currency using exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains
and losses from settlement of these transactions, and from translation of monetary assets and liabilities
at year-end exchange rates, are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in parent
(deficit) / investment as qualifying hedges.

In preparing these combined carve-out financial statements the balances in individual Spreads
Business companies or operations are translated from their functional currency into euros. The income
statement, the cash flow statement and all other movements in assets and liabilities are translated at
average rates of exchange as a proxy for the transaction rate, or at the transaction rate itself if more
appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.

The effect of exchange rate changes during the year on the net assets of foreign operations is
recorded in the combined carve-out statement of comprehensive income.

**CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates in
the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and judgements are regularly
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future period affected. Information about critical
judgements in applying accounting policies, as well as estimates and assumptions that have the most
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year, are included in the following notes:

- separate presentation of items in the income statement – note 3;

- impact of US tax reform and re-measurement of deferred tax asset and liabilities at the new
headline tax rate – note 3 and 6; and

- likelihood of occurrence of provisions and contingencies – notes 17 and 18.

**1. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, JUDGEMENTS AND**
**ASSUMPTIONS**

**RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS**

**ADOPTED BY THE SPREADS BUSINESS**

The Spreads Business applied for the first time amendments to the following standard from 1 January
2017. This did not have a material impact on the Spreads Business:

Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’. This change adds a new requirement to explain
changes in liabilities related to financing activities. The required disclosure has been included in
note 13.

All other standards or amendments to standards that have been issued by the IASB and were effective
by 1 January 2017 were not applicable to the Spreads Business.

**NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING STANDARDS THAT**
**ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE AND HAVE NOT BEEN EARLY ADOPTED BY THE SPREADS**
**BUSINESS**

The following new standards have been released, but are not yet adopted by the Spreads Business.
The expected impact is shown below:

- IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ has been endorsed by the EU and is effective from the year ending
31 December 2018. Based on preliminary work the Spreads Business estimates the impact on the
Spreads Business will be immaterial.

- IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ has been endorsed by the EU and is effective
from the year ending 31 December 2018. Unilever Group has completed a detailed review of the
requirements of IFRS 15, on behalf of the Spreads Business, against current accounting policies
and concluded that current accounting policies are in line with the new standard.

- IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ has been endorsed by the EU and is effective from the year ending
31 December 2019. Based on preliminary work the Spreads Business estimates that more leases
will be recorded on the Spreads Business balance sheet. Significant work is required to evaluate
the potential impact on the Spreads Business due to the high volume of lease contracts. It has not
yet been decided which exemptions will be adopted.

- IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’ is effective from the year ending 31 December
2019. This interpretation clarifies how entities should reflect uncertainties over income tax
treatments, such as when to determine separately or together. Based on preliminary work the
Spreads Business estimates the impact will be immaterial and is in the process of reviewing the
existing arrangements to determine the impact on adoption.

- Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ is effective from the year ending 31 December 2019.
The standard is not yet endorsed by the EU. The change clarifies that following plan amendments,
curtailment or settlements, current service and net interest costs for the remainder of the reporting
period should be calculated in line with updated actuarial assumptions.

All other standards or amendments to standards that have been issued by the IASB and are effective
from 1 January 2018 onwards are not applicable to the Spreads Business.

**2. SEGMENT AND OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION**

**SEGMENT AND OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION**

**Segment information**

Under Unilever ownership, the Spreads Business operates under Unilever’s Foods Segment. The
Spreads Business has not previously been managed in the form that is being divested as part of the
Transaction. Accordingly, we do not present segmental information for the Spreads Business in
accordance with IFRS 8.

**Additional geographical information**

As part of the sales process leading up to the Transaction, Unilever provided certain performance
information, split between Developed Markets and Emerging Markets, to prospective buyers.
Accordingly, we have presented similar geographical information in these combined financial
statements.

Developed Markets and Emerging Markets are defined as follows:

Developed Markets (“DM”) comprise all European, North American, Australasian and Russian
territories. Developed Markets includes the supply chain companies.

Emerging Markets (“EM”) comprise all other territories in which the Spreads Business operates.

**REVENUE**

Turnover comprises sales of goods after the deduction of discounts, sales taxes and estimated returns.
It does not include sales between Spreads companies. Discounts given by the Spreads Business
include rebates, price reductions and incentives given to customers, promotional couponing and trade
communication costs. Turnover is recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying products
have been substantially transferred to the customer. Depending on individual customer terms, this can
be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer acceptance.

**UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT**

Underlying operating profit is operating profit before the impact of non-underlying items within
operating profit (see note 3). Underlying operating profit represents the Spreads business’ measure of
segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for the purpose of making decisions about
allocating resources and assessing performance of segments.

**3. OPERATING COSTS AND NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS**

**BRAND AND MARKETING INVESTMENT**

Brand and Marketing investment includes costs incurred for the purpose of building and maintaining
brand equity and awareness. These include media, advertising production, promotional materials and
engagement with consumers. These costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**

Expenditure on research and development includes staff costs, material costs, depreciation of
property, plant and equipment and other costs directly attributable to research and product
development activities. These costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.

**NON-UNDERLYING ITEMS**

Non-underlying items include restructuring costs and other one-off items within operating profit, and
other significant and unusual items within net profit but outside of operating profit, which the Spreads
Business collectively terms non-underlying items due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence.
These items are significant in terms of nature and/or amount and are relevant to an understanding of
the Spreads Business’ financial performance.

Restructuring costs are charges associated with activities planned by management that significantly
change either the scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted.

Operating costs include other indirect central costs (primarily related to the sales force, general
marketing and merchandising) and general corporate expenses (primarily related to finance, legal,
information technology, human resources, communications, and audit) that have been allocated to the
Spreads Business given that it operated as part of the wider Unilever group. Allocations have been
made on the basis of direct usage when identifiable or as a proportion of revenue when not.

Indirect central costs and general corporate expenses allocated by Unilever to the Spreads Business
reduced from € 91.3 million in 2016 to € 67.2 million in 2017 (2015: € 197.1 million) as a result of the
Spreads Business incurring many of the costs directly after the incorporation part way through 2015 of
the BCS group of legal entities (note 1).

4B. PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS

For defined benefit plans, operating and finance costs are recognised separately in the income
statement. Ongoing operating cost in the income statement is the cost of one additional year of
pension benefits promised to employees for defined benefit plans or contributions paid for defined
contribution plans. In addition, there are also costs and/or credits arising from one-off events such as
past service benefit changes, settlements and curtailments. These one-off events are fully recognised
as they occur in operating cost. The amount charged or credited to finance costs is broadly calculated
by applying the liability interest rate to the defined benefit deficit or surplus at the year end. Any
differences between the expected interest on assets and the actual return achieved by the pension
fund, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in financial and demographic
assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised immediately in the combined carve-out
statement of comprehensive income at the end of the year.

Charges to the income statement which are shown in these accounts are split between (i) defined
benefit pension and other benefit plans which will transfer (recorded on the combined carve-out
balance sheet), and (ii) defined contribution, and defined benefit and other benefit plans which will not
transfer (not recorded on the combined carve-out balance sheet). The finance cost shown in the
income statement is only for the plans that will transfer.

For defined benefit plans which will transfer with the Spreads Business as part of the Transaction,
balance sheet surplus or deficit comprises the total of the market value of plan assets less the present
value of the defined benefit liabilities. Liabilities relating to Unilever employees that are expected to
transfer with the Spreads Business are calculated using a discount rate based on high-quality
corporate bonds, or a suitable alternative where there is no active corporate bond market.

For defined benefit plans which will not transfer with the Spreads Business as part of the Transaction,
no assets or liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet. The income statement charge includes
dedicated pension charges for dedicated Spreads employees and an estimation based on revenue for
other employees. Corporate pension charges have been allocated to the Spreads business.

All defined benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either
by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Spreads Business.

For defined contribution plans, the charges to the income statement are the Spreads Business’
contributions payable in accordance with the plan rules in each country. The Spreads Business’
obligation is limited to the contributions paid into the plans.

F-18


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF PLANS – DEFINED CONTRIBUTION**

Unilever increasingly operates defined contribution plans. The assets are held in external funds and do
not impact Unilever’s balance sheet. Unilever’s obligation in respect of these plans is limited to the
amount that it is required to contribute to the fund for employees in accordance with the plan rules in
each country. Employees then receive the accumulated balance of these contributions when they
retire. Some of the employees of the Spreads Business are members of such defined contribution
schemes.

The principal defined contribution plans in relation to the Spreads Business operated by Unilever are
the country-wide defined contribution plans operated in the UK and the US, and a collective defined
contribution plan operated in the Netherlands. These plans have been set up according to the relevant
requirements of each country.

**DESCRIPTION OF PLANS – DEFINED BENEFIT**

In certain countries, Unilever operates defined benefit pension plans together with other postemployment benefits. The pension payable at retirement is based on employee pensionable
remuneration and length of service. Some of the employees of the Spreads Business were members of
such defined benefit schemes.

The majority of defined benefit plans are either career average, final salary or hybrid plans which
operate on a funded basis. Benefits are determined by the plan rules and are linked to inflation in some
countries.

Defined benefit plan surplus or deficit has been recognised on the balance sheet in these combined
carve-out financial statements for the following countries: Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Mexico, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey.

No assets or liabilities are recognised in these combined carve-out financial statements for defined
benefit plans that will not transfer with the Spreads Business as part of the Transaction.

**ASSUMPTIONS**

Assumptions under IAS 19 are set by reference to market conditions at the valuation date with the
objective of presenting the assets and liabilities of the pensions and other post-employment benefit
plans at their fair value on the balance sheet. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit
liabilities vary according to the country in which the plan is situated. Demographic assumptions, such
as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy (including expectations
of future improvements), plan experience and other relevant data. These assumptions are reviewed
and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.

**CASH FLOW**

Unilever uses a centralised approach to cash management and financing its operations. Transactions
between Unilever and the Spreads Business are accounted for through net parent (deficit) /
investment. Accordingly, none of the cash, cash equivalents, debt or related interest expense at the
corporate level has been assigned to the Spreads Business in these combined carve-out financial
statements, with the exception of cash held by the Baking, Cooking and Spreads legal entities being
divested as part of the Transaction. Cash outflow with respect to defined benefit and defined
contribution schemes is assumed to equal the combined carve-out income statement charge.

4C. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As at 31 December 2017, Unilever had share-based compensation plans in the form of performance
shares, share options and other share awards. The employees of the Spreads Business participated in
the Unilever plans. In addition, the Spreads Business also received an allocation of share-based
compensation charges with respect to corporate employees of Unilever.

The total allocated charge for the year ended 31 December 2017, 2016 and 2015 is shown below and
relates to equity-settled plans:

**2017** 2016 2015


Performance share plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **20.1** 13.4 15.7

**PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS**

Performance share awards are made under the Management Co-Investment Plan (MCIP) and the
Global Share Incentive Plan (GSIP). MCIP share awards and GSIP share awards until 2015 are the
same for all Unilever managers, GSIP share awards from 2016 are different for managers employed by
BCS legal entities and other Unilever managers. The increased charge in 2017 is due to improved
performance of the Spreads Business.

The MCIP allows certain Unilever managers to invest up to 60% (up to 100% from 2017) of their
annual bonus in shares in Unilever and to receive a corresponding award of performance-related
shares. The awards vest after three years (four years from 2017) between 0% and 200% of grant level,
depending on the satisfaction of performance metrics. The performance metrics are underlying sales
growth, operating cash flow and core operating margin improvement (underlying operating margin
improvement from 2017) for Unilever. There is an additional target based on relative total Unilever
shareholder return (TSR) for senior executives.

Under GSIP, certain Unilever managers receive annual awards of NV and PLC shares. For managers
other than those employed by BCS legal entities, the awards vest after three years between 0% and
200% of grant level, depending on the satisfaction of performance metrics. The performance metrics
are underlying sales growth, operating cash flow and core operating margin improvement (underlying
operating margin improvement from 2017) for Unilever. There is an additional target based on relative
total Unilever shareholder return (TSR) for senior executives. Managers employed by BCS legal
entities received GSIP awards as described above until 2015. From 2016, all awards granted to them
will vest in February 2019 between 50% and 1,000% of grant level, depending on one performance
metric. The performance metric is the increase in the valuation of BCS’s business, as valued by a
discounted cashflow and terminal value model, for the period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December
2018.

**6. TAXATION**

6A. INCOME TAX

Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in
the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in net parent
(deficit) / investment.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

The Spreads Business is subject to taxation in the many countries in which it operates. The tax
legislation of these countries differs, is often complex and is subject to interpretation by management
and the government authorities. These matters of judgement give rise to the need to create provisions
for tax payments that may arise in future years. Provisions are made against individual exposures and
take into account the specific circumstances of each case, including the strength of technical
arguments, recent case law decisions or rulings on similar issues and relevant external advice.

(a) The computed tax rate used is the average of the standard rate of tax applicable in the countries in which Spreads Business
operates, weighted by the amount of profit before taxation generated in each of those countries. For this reason the rate may
vary from year to year according to the mix of profit and related tax rates.

The Spreads Business tax rate has been reduced by incentive tax credits, the benefit from preferential
tax regimes that have been legislated by the countries and provinces concerned in order to promote
economic development and investment. The tax rate has been increased by business expenses which
are not deductible for tax, such as entertainment costs and some interest expense, and by charges for
uncertain tax positions.

‘Other’ in 2015 primarily represents the impact of the creation of deferred tax assets arising from
changes in the underlying tax bases of intellectual property and other intangible assets transferred at
fair value on restructuring of the Spreads Business discussed in footnote (b) of the cash flow
statement.

F-22


-----

The Swiss/Dutch transfer relates to the creation of a new deferred tax asset arising on the transfer of
the European supply chain business from Switzerland to the Netherlands on 1 July 2017. This involved
the transfer of profit rights resulting in an intangible asset of € 523 million in BCS Europe BV. The
intangible was created as a result of an intragroup transaction and gives rise to a tax base in the Dutch
tax return. A deferred tax asset of € 131 million (€ 523 million at the Dutch tax rate of 25%) was
recognised in the balance sheet on 1 July 2017. The balance as at 31 December 2017 is € 124 million.
Refer to note (d) in the combined carve-out cash flow statement.

Impact of US tax reform – On 22 December, HR1, formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was
signed into law in the United States. This resulted in a tax benefit of € 19.2 million, primarily due to a
re-measurement of deferred tax asset and liabilities at the new tax rate of 21%.

The Spreads Business’ future tax charge and effective tax rate will be affected by several factors,
including changes in tax laws and their interpretation and still to be determined tax reform proposals in
the EU and Switzerland, as well as the impact of acquisitions, disposals and the future legal structure
of the Spreads Business.

6B. DEFERRED TAX

Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on taxable temporary differences between the tax
base and the accounting base of items included in the balance sheet of the Spreads Business. Certain
temporary differences are not provided for as follows:

- the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and

- differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, at the
year end.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it
is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

As the Spreads Business is not a separate legal group and has not previously prepared standalone
financial statements, it is not possible to prepare or disclose an analysis of deferred tax attributable to
various components of equity. The net liabilities of the Spreads Business are represented by the
cumulative investment of Unilever in the Spreads Business and disclosed as net parent (deficit) /
investment. Therefore, there are no deferred tax liabilities recognised in respect of the aggregate
amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed Spreads Business earnings.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal
authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the combined
carve-out balance sheet:

**7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

**INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

Separately purchased intangible assets are initially measured at cost, being the purchase price as at
the date of acquisition.

Indefinite-life intangible assets mainly comprise trademarks and brands. These assets are not
amortised but are subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate this is necessary. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it
arises.

Finite-life intangible assets comprise software. These assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in
the income statement over the period of their expected useful lives, or the period of legal rights if
shorter. None of the amortisation periods exceed ten years.

**IMPAIRMENT CHARGES**

Material indefinite-life intangible assets have been tested for impairment. No impairments were
identified. This assessment was based on the assessment of fair value, less costs to sell. The Spreads
Business has determined that the business is a single cash generating unit.

**8. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost including eligible borrowing costs less depreciation
and accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the expected average useful lives of the assets.
Residual values are reviewed at least annually. Estimated useful lives by major class of assets are as
follows:

- Freehold buildings (no depreciation on freehold land) . . . . . . . . . 40 years

- Leasehold land and buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 years (or life of lease if less)

- Plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2–20 years

Property, plant and equipment includes:

- land and buildings (or share of those land and buildings) that are transferring to KKR as part of the
Transaction;

- plant and machinery at the above sites where directly attributable to Spreads or, where shared, in
proportion to its estimated use by the Spreads Business based on production cost ratios; and

- plant and machinery at other sites that are not transferring to KKR where directly attributable to
Spreads.

Property, plant and equipment is subject to review for impairment if triggering events or circumstances
indicate that this is necessary. If an indication of impairment exists, the assets or cash generating unit’s
recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is charged to the income statement as it
arises.

**10. INVENTORIES**

direct costs and, where appropriate, a proportion of attributable production overheads. Net realisable
value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

€ 4.5 million) are carried at net realisable value, this being lower than cost. During 2017, € 2.2 million
(2016: € 2.8 million; 2015: € 3.5 million) was charged to the income statement for damaged, obsolete
and lost inventories. In 2017 € 1.3 million (2016: € 1.5 million; 2015: € 1.8 million ) of prior year
inventory provisions were utilised during the year and € 2.6 million (2016: € 2.6 million; 2015:
€ 2.5 million) was released to the income statement.

**11. TRADE AND OTHER CURRENT RECEIVABLES**

Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable
transaction costs. Subsequently these assets are held at amortised cost, using the effective interest
method and net of any impairment losses or at fair value.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Spreads Business’
customer base being large and diverse. The Spreads Business’ historical experience of collecting
receivables, supported by the level of default, is that credit risk is low across territories and so trade
receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. Balances are considered for
impairment on an individual basis rather than by reference to the extent that they become overdue.

**12. TRADE PAYABLES AND OTHER LIABILITIES**

Trade payables and other liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable
transaction costs.

Trade payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.

The subsequent measurement of other liabilities depends on the type of liability:

- Accruals are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.

- Social security and sundry taxes are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective
interest method.

- Others are subsequently measured either at amortised cost, using the effective interest method or
at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income.

**13. CAPITAL AND FUNDING**

**NET PARENT (DEFICIT) / INVESTMENT**

As the Spreads Business is not a separate legal group and has not previously prepared standalone
financial statements, it is not meaningful to disclose share capital or an analysis of reserves. The net
assets of the Spreads Business are represented by the cumulative investment of Unilever in the
Spreads Business and disclosed as net parent (deficit) / investment.

**SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION**

Unilever operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of
ordinary shares of Unilever NV and Unilever PLC. Details of these plans are given in note 4C. The
Spreads Business received an allocation of shared based compensation charges with respect to
corporate employees of Unilever.

**DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

The Spreads Business’ use of, and accounting for, derivative instruments is explained in note 14.

**SUBSIDIARIES WITH NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS**

The Spreads Business operates within a number of legal entities in which non-controlling interests
exist. The most significant non-controlling interests are held in legal entities located in Brazil, Indonesia
and Nigeria.

**DIVIDENDS**

The legal entities within the Spreads Business have not paid or declared dividends to Unilever.

**14. TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT**

**DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING**

Derivatives are measured at fair value with any related transaction costs expensed as incurred. The
treatment of changes in the value of derivatives depends on their use as explained below.

**(I) CASH FLOW HEDGES[(a)]**

Certain derivatives are held to hedge the uncertainty in timing or amount of future forecast cash flows.
Such derivatives are classified as being part of cash flow hedge relationships. For an effective hedge,
gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in net parent (deficit) /
investment. Any ineffective elements of the hedge are recognised in the income statement. If the
hedged cash flow relates to a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in net parent (deficit) /
investment is subsequently included within the carrying value of that asset. For other cash flow
hedges, amounts deferred in net parent (deficit) / investment are taken to the income statement at the
same time as the related cash flow.

When a derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss remains in net
parent (deficit) / investment until the related cash flow occurs. When the cash flow takes place, the
cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement. If the hedged cash flow is no longer expected
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss is taken to the income statement immediately.

**(II) DERIVATIVES FOR WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED**

Derivatives not classified as hedges are held in order to hedge certain balance sheet items. No hedge
accounting is applied to these derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes being
recognised in the income statement.

Unilever treasury department provides central deposit taking, funding and foreign exchange
management services for the Unilever Group’s operations, including those of the Spreads Business.
The department is governed by standards and processes of the Unilever Group which are approved by
the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE). In addition to guidelines and exposure limits, a system of
authorities and extensive independent reporting covers all major areas of activity. Performance of
Unilever treasury department is monitored closely by senior management and reviews are undertaken
periodically by corporate audit.

Unilever treasury department’s activities in relation to the Spreads Business, are designed to:

- protect the Spreads Business’ financial results and position from the financial risks mentioned
below;

- maintain market risks within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns (see note 14B); and

- provide adequate and sufficient funding to the Spreads Business.

Unilever treasury department maintains a list of approved financial instruments. The use of any new
instrument must be approved by the Unilever Chief Financial Officer. The use of leveraged instruments
is not permitted.

The Spreads Business’ capital requirements have been centrally managed by Unilever, who has
provided funding so as to safeguard the Spreads Business’ ability to continue as a going concern and
to optimise returns to Unilever. The Spreads Business is not subject to financial covenants in any of its
significant financing agreements.

The Spreads Business does not have its own credit rating. Unilever Group’s long-term credit rating is
A+/A1 (February 2018) and short-term credit rating is A1/P1 (February 2018). Unilever Group aim to
maintain a competitive balance sheet which management consider to be the equivalent of a credit
rating of A/A2 in the long-term.

(a) Applying hedge accounting has not led to material ineffectiveness being recognised in the income statement for 2017, 2016
and 2015.

The Spreads Business is exposed to the following financial risks that arise from its use of financial
instruments, the management of which is described in the following sections:

 - liquidity risk (see note 14A);

 - market risk (see note 14B); and

 - credit risk (see note 15B).

14A. MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY RISK

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Spreads Business will face in meeting its obligations associated with its
financial liabilities. In conjunction with Unilever Treasury the Spreads Business’ approach to managing
liquidity is to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities when due without incurring
unacceptable losses. The Spreads Business is reliant on Unilever Treasury to meet its obligations
associated with its financial liabilities in both normal and stressed conditions.

The financial liabilities of the Spreads Business at the balance sheet date are mainly loans payable to
Unilever (note 14B) and trade payables (note 12) which are mostly short term in nature. The financial
assets of the Spreads Business at the balance sheet date are mainly trade receivables (note 11) from
reputable customers which are short term in nature.

The Spreads Business has maintained a positive cash balance throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017. This
was the result of cash delivery from the business, coupled with the proceeds from loans provided by
the Unilever Group.

These contractually agreed undiscounted cash flows reflect the portion of total Unilever cash flows
relevant to the Spreads Business. The Spreads Business is not always the contractual owner.

14B. MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK

Spreads Business’ size and operations result in it being exposed to the following market risks that arise
from its use of financial instruments:

- Commodity price risk

The key commodities used by the Spreads Business are rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil,
palm oil, palm stearin and palm kernel oil. Management aims to minimise the impact of commodity
market volatility on (gross) margin and allow time to take corrective pricing action (‘pricing
horizons’). Commodity hedging is undertaken based on 100% of the volume exposure around the
pricing horizon, although hedging can be undertaken up to 52 weeks with approval and within
limits.

- Currency risk

The Spreads Business is exposed to movements in the underlying currency of transacted
commodity prices that are mainly denominated in USD. A layered hedging approach up to
12 months is used to hedge the foreign currency transaction exposure. Because of the Spreads
Business’ global reach, it is also subject to the risk that changes in foreign currency rate impact
the Spreads Business’ sales and purchases.

F-35


-----

The above risks may affect the Spreads Business’ income and expenses, or the value of its financial
instruments. The Spreads Business’ objective in managing market risk is to maintain it within
acceptable parameters, while optimising returns. Generally, the Spreads Business applies hedge
accounting to manage the volatility in profit and loss arising from market risk.

The Spreads Business’ exposure to, and management by Unilever of, these risks is explained below. It
often includes derivative financial instruments, the uses of which are described in note 14C.

**MANAGEMENT POLICY AND**
**POTENTIAL IMPACT OF RISK** **HEDGING STRATEGY** **SENSITIVITY TO THE RISK**


**(I) COMMODITY PRICE RISK**
The Spreads Business is exposed
to the risk of changes in
commodity prices in relation to its
purchase of certain raw materials.

At 31 December 2017, the
Spreads Business had hedged its
exposure to future commodity
purchases with commodity
derivatives valued at
€ 89.6 million
(2016: € 145.9 million;
2015: € 78.5 million; 1 January
2015: € 76.4 million).

**(II) CURRENCY RISK**
**Currency** **risk** **on** **sales** **and**
**purchases**
Because of the Spreads
Business’ global reach, it is
subject to the risk that changes in
foreign currency rate impact the
Spreads Business’ sales and
purchases. The Spreads
Business is also exposed to
movements in the underlying
currency of transacted commodity
prices that are mainly
denominated in USD.

At 31 December 2017, the
exposure to the Spreads
Business from companies holding
financial assets and liabilities
other than in their functional
currency amounted to
€ 2.2 million (2016: € 4.1 million;
2015: € 4.1 million; 1 January
2015: € 0.9 million).


Unilever treasury uses
commodity forward contracts to
hedge against this risk in the
Spreads Business. All
commodity forward contracts
hedge future purchases of raw
materials and the contracts are
settled either in cash or by
physical delivery.

Commodity derivatives are
generally designated as hedging
instruments in cash flow hedge
accounting relations. All
commodity forward contracts
are done in line with approvals
from the Global Commodity
Executive which is chaired by
the Chief Supply Chain Officer
(CSCO) of the Unilever Group.

Unilever treasury manages
currency exposures in the
Spreads Business within
prescribed limits, mainly through
the use of forward foreign
currency exchange contracts.

Operating companies manage
foreign exchange exposures
within prescribed limits. Local
compliance is monitored
centrally.

The aim of the approach to
management of currency risk is
to leave the Spreads Business
with no material residual risk.
This aim has been achieved in
all years presented.

F-36


A 10% increase in commodity
prices as at 31 December 2017
would have led to a € 9.0 million
gain (2016: € 14.6 million gain;
2015: € 7.8 million gain,
1 January 2015: € 7.6 million
gain) on the commodity
derivatives in the cash flow
hedge reserve.

As an estimation of the
approximate impact of the
residual risk, with respect to
financial instruments, the
Spreads Business has
calculated the impact of a 10%
change in exchange rates.

**Impact on income statement**
A 10% strengthening of the euro
against key currencies to which
the Spreads Business is
exposed would have led to
approximately an additional
€ 0.2 million gain in the income
statement (2016: € 0.4 million
gain; 2015: € 0.4 million gain). A
10% weakening of the euro
against these currencies would
have led to an equal but
opposite effect.


-----

**Impact** **on** **net** **parent**
**investment / (deficit) – trade-**
**related cash flow hedges**
A 10% strengthening of the euro
against key currencies would
have led to a € 9.2 million loss
(2016: € 0.9 million loss; 2015:
€ 1.5 million loss) on hedges
used to cover future trade cash
flows to which cash flow hedge
accounting is applied. A 10%
weakening of the euro against
other currencies would have led
to a € 10.1 million gain
(2016: € 1.0 million gain;
2015: € 1.7 million gain) on
hedges used to cover future
trade cash flows to which cash
flow hedge accounting is
applied.

1 year and are interest bearing with rates between (0.02%) and 2.48%.

loss within 12 months. A € 6.0 million credit (2016: € 5.6 million credit; 2015: € 0.7 million debit) was
recycled from the net parent (deficit) / investment to the income statement during the year.

**15. INVESTMENT AND RETURN**

**CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS**

Cash and cash equivalents in the combined carve-out balance sheet include deposits and short-term
deposits. To be classified as cash and cash equivalents, an asset must:

- be readily convertible into cash;

- have an insignificant risk of changes in value; and

- have a maturity period of three months or less at acquisition.

15A. FINANCIAL ASSETS

The Spreads Business aims to protect the value of financial investments while maximising returns. The
fair value of financial assets is the same as the carrying amount for 31 December 2017, 31 December
2016, 31 December 2015 and 1 January 2015. The Spreads Business’ cash resources are shown

15B. CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Spreads Business if a customer or counter-party fails to
meet its contractual obligations. The Spreads Business’ trade receivables are short term in nature and
largely comprise amounts receivable from reputable customers. Additional information in relation to
credit risk on trade receivables is given in note 11. These risks are generally managed by local
Unilever controllers. Credit risk related to the use of treasury instruments is managed on a total
Unilever basis. This risk arises from transactions with financial institutions involving cash and cash
equivalents, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the
reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets. To reduce this risk, Unilever has
concentrated its main activities with a limited number of counter-parties which have secure credit
ratings. Individual risk limits are set for each counter-party based on financial position, credit rating and
past experience. Credit limits and concentration of exposures are actively monitored by Unilever’s
treasury department. Netting agreements are also put in place with Unilever’s principal counter-parties.
In the case of a default, these arrangements would allow Unilever to net assets and liabilities across
transactions with that counter-party.

Further details in relation to the Spreads Business’ exposure to credit risk are shown in note 11.

**16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FAIR VALUE RISK**

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

Derivatives and other cash equivalents are valued using valuation techniques with market observable
inputs (level 2). There are no derivatives and other cash equivalents valued at quoted prices for
identical instruments (level 1) or not based on observable market data (level 3). The models
incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counter-parties, foreign exchange spot and
forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Cash and short-term deposits, trade and other current receivables, overdrafts, trade payables and
other current liabilities have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their shortterm nature.

F-39


-----

Related party loans with Unilever and non-current receivables and payables have a fair value
considered to be materially equal to the carrying value based on the net present value of the
anticipated future cash flows associated with these instruments using rates currently available for debt
on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

**17. PROVISIONS**

Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date, as
a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the
outflow of economic benefit is probable.

Restructuring provisions primarily include people costs such as redundancy costs and cost of
compensation where manufacturing, distribution or selling agreements are to be terminated.

**18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES**

Lease payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

F-40


-----

Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised at the lower of fair value at the date of
commencement of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to
initial recognition, these assets are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy relating to
that specific asset. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the income statement and a
reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance
of the liability.

Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic
benefits, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benefits.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will
result in an obligation in the future. Contingent liabilities are disclosed at the risk adjusted best estimate
of the amount that would be required to settle the liability as at the balance sheet date. Where a risk
weighting is not available, the maximum exposure is reported.

The Spreads Business has no material finance leases.

Other commitments principally comprise commitments under contracts to purchase materials and
services. They do not include commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment, which are
reported in note 8.

**CONTINGENT LIABILITIES**

During 2016, one of Unilever’s subsidiaries in Israel became the subject of an application for
certification of a class action claim based upon allegations as to unfair pricing in the margarine market.
The claim, which has not been certified by the court, would if so certified be for approximately
€ 33 million. Unilever and the Spreads Business intends to robustly defend this claim and believe that
the likelihood that it will ultimately prevail is low, however there can be no guarantee of success in
court. We believe our position is strong and so the matter has not been provided for and is considered
to be a contingent liability. There have been no changes to this assessment in 2017.

On 12 March Unilever Elais Hellas S.A, a Unilever subsidiary in Greece, received a Statement of
Objections from the Hellenic Competition Commission for alleged violations of competition law in the
margarines sector from 1996 until today. Unilever and the Spreads business are still assessing the
implications arising from what is a very complex case. We intend to defend these allegations robustly,
though there are no guarantees of success and therefore the matter has not been provided for and is
considered to be a contingent liability. Due to the complex nature of the case, which is still under
investigation, we are currently unable to assess the level of any potential fine. Should the allegations
be upheld, the maximum fine which could be levied under Greek law is 10% of turnover, which for
Unilever Elais Hellas S.A. would be approximately €40 million.
