-----

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or
solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the
offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the initial purchasers or any affiliate of the initial purchasers
is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be made by the initial purchasers
or such affiliate on behalf of the issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the Offering
Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these
securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the United Kingdom and is
for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being
investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) are persons falling within
Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion
Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in
connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be
communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum
is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant
persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is available only to
relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. No part of this Offering Memorandum should
be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received
by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and
consequently none of the initial purchasers, any person who controls the initial purchasers, the issuer, the
guarantors, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents or affiliates of the foregoing entities or
persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering
Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy version available to you on request from
the initial purchasers.

**Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s**
product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities described in the Offering
Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt securities is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum**
are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution
**Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of**
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the
“Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the debt securities described in the
Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling such debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis
that any offer of such debt securities in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such debt securities.
The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED OCTOBER 15, 2019.**

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**


## Selecta Group B.V.
### €150,000,000 Senior Secured Notes due 2024 consisting of € 5 [7]⁄ 8% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 € Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2024

Selecta Group B.V., a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (the “Issuer”), is offering (the “Offering”) € million in aggregate
principal amount of its 5 [7]⁄ 8% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes”) and € million in aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Floating
Rate Notes due 2024 (the “Additional Floating Rate Notes” and together with the Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the “Additional Notes”). The Additional Notes will be issued under
the indenture dated February 2, 2018, as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Indenture”), governing, inter alia, the Issuer’s existing €765,000,000 5 [7]⁄ 8% Senior Secured
Notes due 2024 (the “Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes”), €325,000,000 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2024 (the “Existing Floating Rate Notes”), and CHF 250,000,000 5 [7]⁄ 8%
Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “CHF Notes” and together with the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the “Existing Notes”; the Existing Notes
together with the Additional Notes, the “Notes”). The Additional Notes will have the same ISIN and common codes as their respective series of Existing Notes, provided that the Additional
Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act (the “Regulation S Additional Notes”) will initially be issued bearing a temporary ISIN and common
code. On and from the consolidation date (the day which is 40 days after the later of the date of the original issuance of such Regulation S Additional Notes and the last date on which we or
any of our affiliates were the owner of Regulation S Additional Notes), the Regulation S Additional Notes will be consolidated and fully fungible with the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes or
the Existing Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S. See “Description of the Notes.”
The Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5 [7]⁄ 8%. The Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes will mature on February 1, 2024. The Issuer will pay interest on the
Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes semi-annually in arrears on October 1 and April 1, commencing on April 1, 2020. Interest on the Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes will be deemed to have
accrued from October 1, 2019, with the interest accrued between October 1, 2019 and the Issue Date forming part of the Issue Price (as described below). The Additional Euro Fixed Rate
Notes (together with the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the “Euro Fixed Rate Notes”) will have the same terms and conditions as the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes and will constitute a
single class with the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Prior to
February 1, 2020, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes by paying a “make-whole” premium. At any time on or after February 1,
2020, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). In addition, prior to
February 1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes issued)
with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings so long as at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes (including any additional Euro Fixed Rate
Notes), as the case may be, issued under the Indenture remain outstanding. Prior to February 1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Fixed
Rate Notes issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal
amount thereof.
The Additional Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR plus 5.375% per annum, reset quarterly, and will mature on February 1, 2024. The Issuer
will pay interest on the Additional Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears on each of April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 2, commencing on January 2, 2020. Interest on the Additional
Floating Rate Notes will be deemed to have accrued from October 1, 2019, with the interest accrued between October 1, 2019 and the Issue Date forming part of the Issue Price (as described
below). The Additional Floating Rate Notes (together with the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the “Floating Rate Notes”) will have the same terms and conditions as the Existing Floating
Rate Notes and will constitute a single class with the Existing Floating Rate Notes for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase. The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate Notes at any time at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.
Additionally, upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control or upon certain asset sales, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes. A change of
control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments
affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes. In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”
The Additional Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing
Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). The Additional Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by AB Servicios Selecta España SLU, Acorn Spain 1 SLU,
Gruppo Argenta S.p.A., Pelican Rouge Coffee Roasters B.V., Selecta AB, Selecta AG, Selecta Belgium N.V., Selecta Nordic Holding AB, Selecta Holding SAS, Selecta Netherlands B.V.,
Selecta SAS, Selecta TMP AG, Selecta U.K. Limited and Selecta UK Holding Limited (each a “Guarantor” and collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantors also guarantee, on a senior
basis, the obligations under the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Guarantees (as defined herein) will rank senior in right of payment to the respective Guarantor’s future
debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the respective Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not so
subordinated, including such Guarantor’s obligations under the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Additional Notes will be secured on the Issue Date by the Collateral (as defined herein), which also secures the Existing Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving
Credit Facility is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) and, along with future hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority
basis under the Indenture, is secured by first-priority security interests over the Collateral, contractually ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Additional Notes. Under
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event of enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral, holders of Additional Notes will receive proceeds from the Collateral only
after the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been repaid in full.
The validity, enforceability and, in respect of the security interests over the Collateral, priority and ranking of the Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors, are
subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The
Additional Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Additional Notes and effectively subordinated to any existing and
future debt of the Issuer and the Guarantors that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Additional Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets.
This Offering Memorandum includes more detailed information on the terms of the Additional Notes and the Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices, security,
covenants, events of default and transfer restrictions.
Application will be made to the International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of
The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance, however, that the Additional Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission
to deal in the Additional Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets
in financial instruments, as amended.
**Investing in the Additional Notes involves a high degree of risk. See the “Risk Factors” section of this Offering Memorandum, beginning on page 29.**


**Issue Price of the Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest from October 1, 2019, to the Issue Date.**
**Issue Price of the Additional Floating Rate Notes:** **% plus accrued and unpaid interest from October 1, 2019, to the Issue Date.**

(“Clearstream”), on or around October, 2019 (the “Issue Date”). See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”
The Additional Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 above €100,000.
**None of the Additional Notes or the Guarantees have been, or will be, registered under the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Additional**
**Notes are being offered and sold in the United States only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the**
**“Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are**
**hereby notified that the seller of the Additional Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Additional Notes**
**and Guarantees may not be offered to retail investors in the European Economic Area, each defined as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of**
**Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that**
**customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the**

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

**_Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Additional Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Additional Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Additional Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Additional
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Additional Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Additional Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point

(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the
“Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Additional Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Additional Notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Additional Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**France**

This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in the context of a public offering in France within the
meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code and therefore has not been and will not
be submitted for clearance to the French Autorité des marchés financiers (the French Financial Markets
Authority).

Consequently, the Additional Notes are not being offered directly or indirectly to the public in France and
this Offering Memorandum has not been distributed or caused to be distributed and will not be distributed or
caused to be distributed to the public in France.

only as provided by Articles L.411-1 to L.411-4, L.412-1 and L.621-8 to L.621-8-3 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code.

**Spain**

The offering of the Additional Notes has not been registered with the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de
Valores and therefore the Additional Notes may not be offered in Spain by any means, except in circumstances
which do not qualify as a public offer of securities in Spain in accordance with article 35 of the Securities Market
Act 4/2015, of October 23 (Real Decreto Legislativo 4/2015, de 23 de octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto

with all legal and regulatory requirements under the Spanish Securities Market Law. None of the Additional

In addition to the segments identified above, we reported separately on our Headquarters (HQ), which
included corporate center functions in Switzerland.

**_Business Channels_**

We also report our revenue and certain other financial data by business channel. Our business channels
consist of the following for the year ended September 30, 2018, and the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and
2019:

   - The workplace channel, which includes revenue from (i) private self-service retail, consisting of PoS
placed and serviced in various private locations, such as large corporate customers, in various
businesses and industries and including in corporate offices, manufacturing and logistics sites, and
(ii) OCS, which is comprised of table-top coffee machines rented out to corporate customers (mainly
small and medium-sized enterprises) for office use along with the provision of technical services and
coffee and related supplies for the PoS;

   - The on-the-go channel, which includes revenue from PoS placed and serviced in semi-public areas,
such as hospitals, universities and entertainment venues, or public areas, such as train stations, airports
and gas stations, following a successful bidding process with relevant government authorities to place
our PoS in a given location; and

   - The trading channel, which includes revenue from sales of machines and products, including coffee
roasted in our roasting facility and the provision of technical and hygienic support to customers.

We did not report our revenue by the above business channels in our financial statements for prior periods,
including for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2017. However, for comparative purposes, we presented
our revenue for the year ended September 30, 2017, by business channels in our 2018 Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**Non-GAAP Financial Information**

**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**

This Offering Memorandum contains non-GAAP measures and ratios, including EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin, gross
capital expenditures, net capital expenditures, revenue net of vending fee, and other measures and ratios that are
not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. We use these non-GAAP measures to help evaluate
growth trends, assess operational performance and monitor cash performance. We believe that presenting these
non-GAAP measures is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance. We present non-GAAP
measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities
analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The non-GAAP
measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as
analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as
reported under IFRS.

We define our non-GAAP measures as follows:

   - “Adjusted Cash Capital Expenditures (CS & CC)” consists of Adjusted Net Capital Expenditures
(CS & CC), net of finance lease inflows to Selecta, Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending,
adjusted at constant currency;

xi


-----

- “Adjusted EBIT (CS & CC)” represents our Adjusted EBITA (CS & CC) less Adjusted Amortization
(excluding purchase price allocation) (CS & CC) and purchase price allocation amortization. See
“Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”;

- “Adjusted EBITA (CS & CC)” represents our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) less Adjusted
Depreciation (CS & CC). See “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”;

- “Adjusted EBITDA” represents profit/(loss) before net finance results and income tax, before
(i) depreciation, (ii) amortization expense, (iii) restructuring/redundancy costs, (iv) project expenses,
(v) transaction and integration expenses, (vi) (profit)/loss on sale of subsidiaries, (vii) financing
activities, and (viii) other adjustments, as described further in “Summary—Summary Historical
_Financial and Other Information—Historical Consolidated Financial Information—Other Financial_
_Data and Operating Information”;_

- “Adjusted EBITDA margin” represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue net of vending
fee; we present Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue net of vending fee because we believe
that it is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance as it takes into account the impact
of vending fee on our revenue;

- “Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC)” represents our EBITDA on a constant scope and constant currency
basis after giving effect to certain management adjustments. See “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated
_Financial Information” for a reconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for each_
period presented;

- “Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margin” represent Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) as a percentage of
Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC) (as defined below);

- “Adjusted Gross Capital Expenditures (CS & CC)” represents our capital expenditures on a constant
scope and constant currency basis. See “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”;

- “Adjusted Net Capital Expenditures (CS & CC)” consists of the Adjusted Gross Capital Expenditures
(CS & CC), less net book value of any property, plant, and equipment sold, adjusted at constant
currency;

- “Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC)” represents Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) less vending fees for
each of Selecta, Pelican Rouge and Argenta, adjusted for scope and reconciliation, reclassification, and
constant currency adjustments. See “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”;

- “Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC)” represents our revenue on a constant scope and constant currency
basis. See “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information” for a reconciliation of revenue
to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for each period presented;

- “EBITDA” represents profit/(loss) before net finance results and income tax, before depreciation and
amortization expense;

- “gross capital expenditures” consist of self-service retail equipment purchased;

- “LTM Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC)” represents our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2019, further adjusted to give effect to estimated annualized run-rate
cost savings and synergies resulting from the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and
the Express Vending Acquisition that we have not yet realized;

- “net capital expenditures” consist of gross capital expenditures, less the book value of total disposals of
self-service retail equipment (which includes old PoS sold in such period);

- “non-IFRS cash conversion” represents the difference between Adjusted EBITDA (CC & CS) and
Adjusted Net Capital Expenditures (CS &CC), divided by Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC);

- “revenue net of vending fee” represents our revenue less vending fee;

- “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA” represents Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to give effect to the
cost savings and synergies that we have realized and expect to achieve as a result of the Pelican Rouge
Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition, as described further in
“Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Information—Historical Consolidated Financial
_Information—Other Financial Data and Operating Information”; and_

- “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin” represents Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of
revenue net of vending fee.

-----

These non-GAAP measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS
and should not be considered as alternatives to revenue or net profit for the period or any other performance
measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as
alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities.

Some of the limitations of non-GAAP measures are that:

   - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;

   - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

   - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to
be indicative of our ongoing operations;

   - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any
cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

   - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect
cash payments that were made, or may be made in the future; and

   - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as comparative measures.

**_Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information_**

We also present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited non-GAAP aggregated financial
information (the “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”) on a constant scope and
constant currency basis for the relevant periods. The results of operation for each of the Pelican Rouge Group,
the Argenta Group and the Express Vending Group are represented in our Historical Financial Statements only as
of the respective date of each of their acquisition. As a result, our Historical Financial Statements are not directly
comparable with each other for each of the relevant periods. We also completed a number of disposals between
2016 and 2018, which also affect the comparability of our financial results between periods. We believe that
presenting the Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information is useful to investors in evaluating our
financial performance as we believe this information will aid comparability of our results of operations. The
Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any
generally accepted accounting standards nor with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the
Prospectus Regulation, or any other regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, or any other regulator.
The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been derived by applying adjustments to our
Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, which adjustments are not
recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards.

The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been derived by applying certain
adjustments to each of our Historical Financial Statements and the financial statements of the Pelican Rouge
Group, the Argenta Group and the Express Vending Group for the relevant periods. Such adjustments fall within
two categories, adjusting for the scope of the financial information included (constant scope adjustments) and the
exchange rates used in respect of the financial information recorded in currencies other than euro (constant
currency adjustments), as described in detail below.

_Constant Scope Adjustments_

The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been adjusted to give effect to the
transactions described below, as if they had occurred on October 1, 2015, to the extent they were not already
reflected in the relevant period:

   - the acquisition by Selecta AG of the Pelican Rouge Group, which occurred on September 7, 2017, and
contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 6, 2017;

   - the acquisition by TopCo of the Argenta Group, which occurred on February 2, 2018, and contributes
to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to February 1, 2018;

xiii


-----

   - the acquisition by Selecta AG of the Express Vending Group, which occurred on August 17, 2018, and
contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to August 16, 2018;

   - the disposal of Pelican Rouge subsidiaries in Sweden, which occurred in March 2016, and contributes
to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in March 2016;

   - the disposal of Pelican Rouge subsidiaries in Germany, which occurred in March 2016, and contributes
to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in March 2016;

   - the disposal of Selecta subsidiaries in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which occurred in March 2017,
and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016;

   - the disposal of a Selecta subsidiary in Finland, which occurred in March 2018, and contributes to the
adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2017; and

   - the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which occurred on September 19, 2018, and contributes to the
adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 18, 2018.

While the Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been adjusted to reflect acquisitions
that we consider significant, it does not reflect all acquisitions we have completed during the relevant period. We
categorize acquisitions of businesses with less than €3.0 million in gross sales for the twelve months preceding
such acquisition as part of our organic growth. Consequently, transactions involving such acquisitions are not
included in the constant scope adjustments to our Historical Financial Statements.

In addition to the above, adjustments are made as a result of accounting policy differences and
reclassifications, as further detailed under “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information—Adjusted
_Revenue (CS & CC) and Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC)” and “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial_
_Information—Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC).”_

_Constant Currency Adjustments_

We are a geographically diversified business with operations in 16 countries across Europe and accordingly
we undertake transactions in various currencies. Many of our subsidiaries report their financial results in
currencies other than the euro, the reporting currency used in our Historical Financial Statements. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and
_Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk.” To enhance the comparability of our_
financial results, such results are presented using a constant exchange rate across all periods presented. Measures
calculated using constant exchange rates are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. The
exchange rates used for the calculation of constant exchange rate measures presented in this Offering
Memorandum have been derived from the European Central Bank as of September 29, 2017, which constitute
our budget exchange rates for the financial years ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, as set out in the following
table:

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or thousands, certain operating data, percentages describing market shares and penetration rates, have
been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this Offering Memorandum may
vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes
over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using the numerical data in the_
Historical Financial Statements or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this
Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and do not use the numerical data in the narrative description thereof. As a
result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented in tabular form may differ from the
information that would have appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial information.

**Key Performance Indicators**

Certain key performance indicators and other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum are derived from management information and estimates and are not part of our financial
statements or our accounting records. Our use or computation of these measures may not be comparable to the
use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Any or all of these measures should
not be considered in isolation or as an alternative measure of performance under IFRS or any other generally
accepted accounting principles.

In this Offering Memorandum, core markets refers to Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which are the markets in which we hold or, in the
case of Italy, would have held if the Argenta Acquisition had been completed, the number one or two market
positions as of the year ended December 30, 2017.

**Financial Year**

The financial year of the Group ends on September 30 of each calendar year.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

This Offering Memorandum contains statistics, data and other information regarding markets, market sizes,
market shares, market positions, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to the Group’s business and
markets. Unless otherwise indicated, such information is based on the Issuer’s analysis of multiple sources, and
the industry and market data. Such information has been accurately reproduced and, as far as the Issuer is aware
from such information, no facts have been omitted which would render the information provided inaccurate or
misleading.

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the market in
which we operate and compete. Certain market data and economic and industry data and forecasts used in this
Offering Memorandum were obtained from governmental and other publicly available information, independent
industry publications and reports prepared by industry consultants. These include information extracted without
material adjustment from a commissioned report published by OC&C Strategy Consultants (“OC&C”). The
OC&C Report has been produced based on publications comprising industry data, forecasts, surveys and other
information made available to OC&C by third-party data providers. Some of the data in those publications are
based on estimates in respect of our business whereas OC&C have been provided with actual data by us. The
OC&C Report is therefore based on a combination of third-party sources, adjusted where appropriate to reflect
actual data. As such, the data, statistics and analysis provided by OC&C may differ from the data, statistics and
analysis contained in other industry publications. OC&C’s views on markets and their competitive environment
are derived from a broad range of sources, and include market projections based on estimated historic growth
rates, the projection of known factors which have driven historic market growth and their projected future
evolution. There is an inherent degree of uncertainty in these projections; they are estimates and should be treated
as such. In addition, we have also included information regarding the market in which we operate, which is based
on internal data, management’s estimates, and other sources. In considering the industry and market data
included in this Offering Memorandum, prospective investors should note that such information may be subject
to significant uncertainty due to differing definitions of the relevant markets and market segments described. In
many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government
bodies or other organizations) to independently verify our market related analyses and estimates, thus requiring
us to rely on internally developed data. Consequently, we have made certain estimates largely based on internal
surveys and studies. In the absence of such information, we have made statements regarding our industry and
market share based on our experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our management’s best
estimates. When discussing market share for the year ended December 31, 2017, the terms “we,” “us,” and “our”
include for such purpose the market share of Argenta, even though the Argenta Acquisition was not completed
until February 2, 2018. While we believe our estimates to be reasonable, they have not been verified by any
independent sources and we cannot assure you that any of our assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our
position in the industry. Neither we nor any of the Managers make any representation as to the accuracy of such
information.

While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such
data involves risks and uncertainties and is subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed
under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Offering Memorandum.

shorter period, as the case may be.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Offering Memorandum contains and refers to certain forward-looking statements with respect to our
financial condition, results of operations and business. Forward-looking statements are statements of future
expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and
unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from
those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements
concerning the potential exposure to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations, beliefs,
plans, objectives, intentions, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. All statements other than
statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “objectives,” “outlook,” “probably,” “project,” “will,” “seek,”
“target” and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial
performance. All of these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by such
entities that, although believed to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain. Therefore, undue reliance should not be
placed upon any forward-looking statements. There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. In addition, even if our actual results
are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or
developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that
could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to:

   - changes in general economic conditions, consumer confidence and consumer spending could have an
adverse effect on our business;

   - the success of our vending business depends on consumer preferences, technological innovations and
the consumer’s experience with the vending machines we operate;

   - our business is exposed to fluctuations in costs related to fuel, coffee and other commodity prices;

   - changes in governmental regulations and legislation could adversely affect our business;

   - we operate in a highly competitive market, and if we do not compete effectively, we may lose market
share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our products and services;

   - an increase in vending rent rates could negatively affect our business;

   - our success is dependent, in part, upon the integrity of our management and employees, and our risk
management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law, including mishandling
of cash;

   - a failure of our key information technology, accounting software, and inventory management systems
or processes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business;

   - we may not successfully implement our business strategies, including achieving our growth objectives;

   - we may incur civil and criminal liability due to infringements of the Swiss Data Protection Act and
other applicable data protection laws relating to theft, loss, or misuse of data relating to our employees,
customers or other third parties;

   - defects, failures or security breaches in and inadequate upgrades of, or changes to, our PoS and the
accompanying software could harm our business;

   - any negative impact on the reputation of the brand names of certain of the key products we sell may
adversely affect our competitive position;

   - the performance of our business is negatively affected by increases in Value Added Tax (“VAT”) rates
on food and beverage items sold in vending machines and any further increase in VAT could require us
to incur additional costs and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition;

   - we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

   - we face various political, economic, legal, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with
conducting business in multiple countries;

   - we depend on a limited number of suppliers for the manufacture of the vending machines and the
provision of telemetry equipment we require to operate our business;

xvii


-----

   - disruptions in our supply and logistics chain could adversely affect us;

   - our business requires capital expenditures that may divert significant cash flow from other investments
or uses, including debt servicing;

   - the loss of major clients or partners, or the inability to establish new client relationships or partnerships
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;

   - the result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on
our business;

   - we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquired businesses into our existing business;

   - we may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection
with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express
Vending Acquisition);

   - certain products we sell are susceptible to seasonal variation and sustained periods of abnormal weather
can have a material adverse effect on our business;

   - we are susceptible to claims of anti-competitive practices;

   - our insurance is limited and subject to exclusions, and depends on the ongoing viability of our insurers;
we may also incur liabilities or losses that are not covered by insurance;

   - we are exposed to credit risk related to our clients, which may cause us to make larger allowances for
doubtful trade receivables or incur write-offs related to impaired debts;

   - our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key employees;

   - we may face labor disruptions that could interfere with our operations and have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;

   - restrictions to the immigration of workers from EU countries to Switzerland could impede our ability
to hire or retain employees in Switzerland and limit our ability to conduct our business;

   - we are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings in the normal course of our
business and otherwise;

   - our indemnification rights under the acquisition agreements we have entered into are limited;

could adversely affect our financial condition;

   - increases in the minimum wage or labor and employment costs may have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations;

   - we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may not realize the full value thereof;

   - the Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information presented in this Offering Memorandum
may not reflect what our actual results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented
and thus these results may not be indicative of our future operating performance. The Unaudited
Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information included herein are subject to certain significant
assumptions and limitations;

   - the interests of our principal shareholder may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of Notes;

   - changes in tax laws or challenges to the Group’s tax position could adversely affect the Group’s results
of operations and financial condition;

   - Italian withholding taxes or deduction may be payable on amounts paid by Italian Guarantors; and

**Overview**

We are the leading route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider in Europe by
revenue with more than 475,000 points of sale (“PoS”) in 16 countries as of June 30, 2019, covering
approximately 95% of European GDP and approximately 78% of the European population. We held the number
one or number two market position based on revenue in 2017 in our ten core markets of Belgium, France,
Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We served over
ten million consumers per day via more than 3,800 routes as of June 30, 2019. We operate in a highly fragmented
market, which provides growth opportunities, both organically and through accretive acquisitions. For the twelve
months ended June 30, 2019, we generated a revenue of €1,580.8 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of
€267.7 million, and we would have generated an Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,604.7 million and an
Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) of €271.2 million, achieving 3.8% Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth
compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, and 18.9% Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margins.

The following map illustrates the countries in which we operate, our geographical segments as of June 30,
2019, and our market positions in the Focus Countries (as defined below) for the year ended December 30, 2017.

_Source: OC&C. Market data as of 2017. Our market share in Italy consists of the 2017 market share of Argenta, which we acquired in_
_February 2018. Our market share in the UK consists of the 2017 market share of Selecta combined with (i) the 2017 market share of the UK_
_operations of Pelican Rouge, which we acquired in September 2017, and (ii) the 2017 market share of Express Vending, which we acquired in_
_August 2018._

Our diversified product offering includes both coffee and hot drinks, and we have entered into strong
partnerships with global premium coffee brands such as Starbucks and Lavazza, which allow us to benefit from
consumers’ increasing preference for premium products, especially coffee, and result in higher margins. We also
cater to the impulse-based consumer purchases with offerings of snacks, including healthy options, cold drinks
and fresh food sold through traditional impulse PoS as well as our recently introduced MicroMarkets concept.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) as a percentage of the types of
items we sell amounted to 56% for coffee and hot drinks, 29% for impulse items, and 15% for other.

We serve customers and generate revenue in the workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business
channels further discussed below:

(*) Adjusted Revenue (CS & CS) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

Our business model covers the full value chain of the coffee and convenience food Unattended SSR Market,
from green bean roasting to brewing to the consumer’s cup, and we have developed industry leading coffee
know-how, capabilities, and expertise in connection with these processes. We roast and produce both instant and
full bean coffee, which we use in our own PoS, our customers’ PoS and also sell to third parties, and as such, our
roaster in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, is an important driver of our coffee expertise. We have created a strong
portfolio of high-quality coffee brands, such as our in-house developed Pelican Rouge brand and its
craftsmanship image that caters for growing number of consumers increasingly looking for this attribute. Our
Pelican Rouge brand complements our premium coffee offering in partnership with Lavazza and Starbucks. We
leverage our technology capabilities and data collection from PoS to provide relevant products, gauge consumer
preferences and maximize revenue opportunities, which improve consumer experience and customer satisfaction.
We also provide cleaning, maintenance, and technical support services which can be customized based on
individual customer needs and preferences, even when we do not enter into a full self-service retail service
arrangement with the customer. In addition to our unattended self-service and coffee roasting operations, we also
sell coffee and machines, including to hotels, restaurants and cafés, and machine parts and products independent
of self-service retail service arrangements.

Due to the predictable nature of our business and the length of our customer contracts, we believe we are
able to achieve high revenue visibility. We benefit from diversified revenue streams secured by multi-year
contracts derived from a large and loyal customer base across private and public sector in 2018 and a 100%
retention rate with our top ten customers over that period. As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that our average
private customer contract term is three to five years, and our average public customer contract term is five to ten
years. Moreover, the maintenance and cleaning services we offer as part of our self-service retail services provide
us with an additional source of high margin revenues.

Innovation and technology are also key drivers of our success, and we benefit from our track record of
innovation leadership both in terms of technology upgrades such as cashless payment, touchscreen user
interfaces and telemetry, as well as in terms of unattended self-service retail concepts, such as MicroMarkets, to
drive daily revenue per PoS and open new routes-to-market.

-----

Since our founding in Switzerland in 1957, we have grown organically as well as through acquisitions. On
September 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the Pelican Rouge Group, which increased our presence in
nine of the 15 markets in which we operated at that time, making us the market leader by revenue in France,
Spain, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. In addition, on February 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of the
Argenta Group, a leading unattended self-service retail operator in Italy, which became our 16[th] market. On
August 17, 2018, we acquired Express Vending, a leading UK supplier of premium unattended self-service retail
services, bolstering our position as the leading European provider of route-based unattended self-service coffee
and impulse and convenience food offerings, including MicroMarkets, and further consolidated our leading
position in the United Kingdom. Express Vending is at the forefront of MicroMarket design and deployment in
the UK. Express Vending’s Express HUB brand stores, with open plan refreshment areas, an extensive product
range and self-scan kiosks.

As a result of these acquisitions, our innovation and technology leadership, and through upgrades of our
business, operating systems and corporate culture, we have achieved a leading position in Europe as a routebased unattended self-service retail provider with strong know-how and capabilities in providing coffee and
impulse offerings across a range of workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business channels. We had
average market shares ranging between 10% and 15% in our core markets for the year ended December 30, 2017,
compared to approximately 6% of the European market over the same period in 2016, and we served over ten
million consumers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 6 million for the year
ended September 30, 2016. We see significant opportunities for further organic growth and accretive
acquisition-led growth in our highly fragmented markets.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the key competitive strengths listed below.

**_Business Proposition Offering Unmatched Convenience_**

We offer consumers a wide variety of on-the-go food products for everyday consumption and impulse
purchases, with a strong focus on coffee, at all hours of the day and every day of the year thanks to our
unattended, 24/7, fully automated, convenience retail concept. Our concept targets captive environments and is
economically viable even in low footfall locations due to our minimal operational costs compared with
traditional retail concepts. Our ability to sell products in convenient retail locations and our high level of
customer service has led to an average overall customer retention based on revenue of approximately 95.9% for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and approximately 92.5% and 94.4% for each of the years ended
September 30, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We believe that the quality of our service levels and our customer
relationship management contribute to customer loyalty, leading to an average relationship of approximately 15
years with our 10 largest customers. In addition, contract renewals with our existing long-term customers are
typically more profitable than entering into a contract with a new customer, due to savings on equipment and
other capital expenditures and customer acquisition costs. Our costs associated with new customers are followed
by predictable revenue streams and we usually recoup these costs within two years. We have a scalable routebased business model that we are able to apply across the 16 countries in which we operate with the same key
success factors, to drive growth in customers, daily revenue per PoS and profitability. For example, following the
Argenta Acquisition in 2018, we have replicated Argenta’s MicroMarkets operating model in other countries
such as Switzerland and the Netherlands. Our focus on out-of-home impulse consumption limits our exposure to
competition from online retailers and offerings.

**_Well Positioned to Take Advantage of Premium Coffee and Out-of-Home Consumption Growth_**

We operate in the convenience food and beverage market, estimated at €42 billion in 2017 (our
“Addressable Market”) in our focus countries of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (the “Focus Countries”). Within the Addressable Market, we focus on the
Unattended SSR Market which has a market size of approximately €16 billion in our 16 countries of operations,
of which approximately €15 billion arises in the Focus Countries. Our Addressable Market has grown at a CAGR
of 2.1% between 2012 and 2017, reaching a total value of approximately €40.5 billion in the Focus Countries and
is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% reaching €47.1 billion by 2022. This trend has been driven by a positive
macro-economic backdrop with an increase in GDP and stable employment levels, which have led to increased
spending in the workplace channel. In addition, we believe that an increasing preference for drinking premium
coffee and out-of-home consumption, increased mobility, and the desire for easy availability of healthy and
quality products is driving consumers towards our pan-European on-the-go self-service retail offerings. For


3


-----

example, sales of coffee within the Addressable Market has grown at a CAGR of 2.8% between 2012 to 2017,
reaching €16.0 billion, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.9%, reaching €19.4 billion by 2022.

Moreover, the growing trend toward premium brands has created a shift in consumer emphasis on high
quality product offerings, including organic and name-brand coffee, a trend which we are addressing with our
Starbucks, and Lavazza brand partnerships. For example, we are able to offer consumers a premium hot drinks
experience, both in the workplace and on-the-go through our long-standing partnership with Starbucks. As of
June 30, 2019, we have installed approximately 1,964 Starbucks concepts across Europe, and the price of a
coffee sold in our Starbucks on-the-go concept is between 20% to 90% higher than a coffee sold in traditional
self-service PoS, and such trends for premium brands support our profitability. Similarly, through our partnership
with Lavazza we offer our customers and consumers additional options for a premium coffee experience. As of
June 30, 2019, we had over 15,637 PoS selling Lavazza coffee and we estimate that approximately 40,000 PoS
will serve Lavazza coffee in the long-term.

**_Leading Unattended Self-Service Coffee and Convenience Food Provider in the European Unattended SSR_**
**_Market with Growth above Market_**

We are the leading route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider in the
Unattended SSR Market, and had an estimated 10% market share by revenue in the Focus Countries for the year
ended December 30, 2017, compared to 6% over the same period in 2016. We believe that our adjusted revenue
(on a constant scope and constant currency basis) for the year ended September 30, 2018, was approximately 3.5
times that of the second largest market player. As of June 30, 2019, we had operations in 16 European countries,
which covered approximately 95% of European GDP and contain approximately 78% of the European
population. In 2016, we served over six million consumers per day, which we have nearly doubled to more than
ten million consumers served per day. We held the number one or number two market position based on revenue
in 2017 in our ten core markets, and we estimate that this market data is still accurate as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum. Our sales in these markets represented 90.7% of our revenue for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, we operated a network of more than 475,000 active coffee and
convenience food and beverage self-service PoS, approximately 2.5 times the number of PoS of the second
largest market player. With regards to our suppliers, we believe we are the largest machine buyer in the highly
fragmented Unattended SSR Market, making us the customer of choice for our suppliers, which in turn provides
us with competitively priced procurement arrangements on, amongst other, a wide selection of market leading
machines.

The Unattended SSR Market is characterized by fragmentation and intense competition on a local level. We
are one of the very few operators on a pan-European level, which increases the appeal of our brands and
offerings with consumers and of our services and concepts with customers, as compared with our smaller
competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in each of our three
geographic segments was split relatively evenly with Central accounting for 37%, North accounting for 26%, and
South, UK & Ireland accounting for 37%. This is in contrast to the second largest market player, over three
quarters of whose revenue in its last financial year was derived from Italy alone. In addition, the breadth of our
product portfolio enables us to better address consumers’ preferences across geographic segments, including
evolving market trends, and to provide a one-stop shop offering for our customers. Additionally, our established
brands and unique concepts differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to secure attractive and
comprehensive contracts with a variety of suppliers and premium brands, which help us maintain our high
market share.

**_Using Innovation and Technology to Drive Growth and Improve Margins_**

We use innovation and new technologies to drive our growth and improve margins, and we have a track
record of innovation leadership through continuous rollouts of upgrades to our PoS across all geographies.
Innovation and technology improve the consumer experience, enhance operational excellence and allow us to
further expand our route-based business model. Cashless payment systems and digital touchscreen user interfaces
that we are rolling out across our PoS park enhance the consumer experience by providing additional
accessibility and simplicity of use, thereby driving number of sales and average transaction size compared to
cash transactions. As of June 30, 2019, daily revenue per PoS equipped with cashless technology are on average
10% to 20% higher than PoS that only accept cash, and the average transaction value of products sold from
cashless PoS is between 5% to 10% higher, making cashless payment options an important driver in increasing
sales from existing PoS. As of June 30, 2019, 95% of our public PoS deployed cashless technology. Telemetry in
our PoS allows us to better adjust our pricing and product offerings to drive sales and to more efficiently monitor


4


-----

inventory levels and determine maintenance requirements, which increases our route efficiency and operational
excellence, and thereby improves service quality and customer retention. As of June 30, 2019, we had telemetry
devices installed in approximately 95% of our public PoS. In addition to technological innovation, we also
continue to innovate and introduce new unattended self-service retail concepts, such as MicroMarkets, to adapt to
market and consumer trends, increase sales and improve profitability, while reducing capital expenditures.

**_Route-Based Business Model with High Density on the Last Mile_**

Our route-based business model combined with our size represents a distinct competitive advantage,
particularly on the last mile of service, which allows us to service and supply PoS at an optimized cost level,
thereby improving our profitability compared to other competitors. In addition, we continuously optimize the
density of our PoS to make routes more efficient, thereby reducing driving time and increasing our ability to
service more PoS per hour and more PoS per FTE. We are, therefore, able to offer more competitive pricing at
the same profitability point or the same levels of service at a lower price, as compared to less profitable smaller
regional players, thereby creating genuine barriers to match our scale. We also use data from our PoS equipped
with telemetry and our dedicated team of approximately 150 planners (as of June 30, 2019) to continuously
optimize our over 3,800 dense and cost-effective routes. As of June 30, 2019, our 4,900 route merchandizers and
1,400 route technicians were able to service their routes using a fleet of over 5,000 vehicles. The map below
illustrates the location of each of our PoS, and shows the density of our route-based networks.

**_Scale Driven Business Model Creating Attractive Economics and Enhancing Established Market Presence_**

We have developed a business model with a cost advantage through economies of scale and high density,
and we believe it will be difficult for potential competitors to replicate the scale, breadth, and efficiency of our
organization. Our scale also enables us to deliver superior customer service by leveraging our knowledge of the
industry to provide customers and consumers with a comprehensive range of products and innovative service
offerings. These attributes lead to an estimated 5% to 15% EBITDA margin (as defined by and according to
OC&C) advantage over smaller competitors.

We deploy capital expenditures in order to retain and acquire new customers and do so by acquiring new
PoS and refurbishing our existing PoS in order to enhance returns on investment. Capital expenditure for new
PoS and refurbishment of existing PoS of the Group typically achieves a ROI ranging from 100% to 250%,
depending on the country, with the highest returns in the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland. We have
consistently achieved efficiencies stemming from PoS park rationalization (which includes margin management,
relocating PoS to more profitable locations, and decreasing the types of PoS in use) and refurbishment. In
addition to the operational advantages explained above we also believe that given our scale we retain a cost
advantage over our competitors in terms of pricing from machine suppliers and that our in-house refurbishment
and maintenance capabilities also provide us a cost advantage.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Organic Growth, Profitability and Cash Conversion Momentum_**

Our business has delivered consistent financial results with resilient Adjusted EBITDA margins and stable
cash flow generation, with a non-IFRS cash conversion (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) minus
Adjusted Net Capital Expenditures (CS & CC), divided by Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC)) of 46.7%, 45.9%, and
52.0% for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, and 49.1% for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA minus net capital expenditures, divided by Adjusted EBITDA,
amounted to 38.2%, 42.5% and 50.8% for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and
49.0% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Following the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta
Acquisition, and the Express Vending Acquisition, we have also benefited from significant cost synergies
including, among others, procurement savings, footprint optimization, headquarters integration, and price
harmonization and streamlining. As we continue to realize synergies, our efficiency improves and cash
conversion continues on a positive trend.

Our strong market positions in key markets, coupled with our ongoing efforts to optimize PoS density and
operational efficiencies, increased technology penetration, as well as data analytics across all markets contribute
to further enhancing our financial profile and organic growth. Excluding France and the UK, we achieved
revenue growth of 4.3% for the year ended September 30, 2018, compared to the year ended September 30, 2017,
and 5.2% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, while
achieving organic revenue growth at constant scope and constant currency (as further described under
“Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”) of 3.4% and 2.7% during the same respective
periods. Additionally, through our continued efforts to install new and upgrade existing PoS as well as optimize
our product offering, we have seen a growth of 1.4% in our daily revenue per PoS in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.

**_Experienced Executive Management Team with Proven Execution Track Record_**

We have a long and successful track record of attracting and retaining top talent and have continued to
invest in a high quality management team in order to most effectively manage our existing operations and
execute our strategies. Our senior management team is led by our CEO, David Flochel, Chairman, David Hamill,
CFO, Gabriel Pirona, and COO, Pascal Uffer, who have more than 80 years of combined experience and
leadership track record with international companies. The senior management team has a strong focus on
functional expertise and is complemented by local management teams with regional focus. Over the past three
years, the team has successfully led the roll-out of our innovative Starbucks on-the-go concepts, the
implementation of our profitable partnership with Lavazza, as well as our MicroMarkets concept, and have
successfully progressed the roll-out of new technologies for our PoS across our geographic markets and the
integration of the Pelican Rouge and Gruppo Argenta acquisitions. We believe that the collective industry
knowledge and leadership of our senior management team will enable them to continue to grow our business and
execute our strategies.

**Our Strategies**

**_Key Pillars Driving Our Strategy_**

We intend to continue to nurture our strong reputation with our customers and consumers and to deliver
consistently superior financial results, in line with our ultimate goal of achieving a culture of excellence. This
excellence stems from a driven and successful team combined with a clear, strategic, and consistent framework,
according to which we take decisions and run our business. We have identified the following key pillars driving
our strategy, as further described below.

**_Driving Performance Through Sales Excellence_**

The first line for growing our business and improving our margins is excellence in sales, as it is through
sales that we increase our pipeline of potential new contracts, increase our new contract gains and maintain our
high level of customer retention. Sales excellence is the key driver of our organic growth, and over the last two
years we committed a substantial portion of our resources to improving our salesforce effectiveness and further
strengthening our relationship with our customers. We focus on performance-led management and increased
activity dedicated to new business sales teams and account managers. As part of this initiative, we are engaging
in training, coaching on the job and concept selling to enhance the capabilities of our sales force and to lead the

execution of our strategies. The tables below show our new contract pipeline, increase in new gains and customer
retention since 2017:

**Negotiation** **Agreed** **Signed**


**_Further Developing Pricing and Category Management_**

We believe that there is a significant opportunity to increase daily revenue per PoS by improving pricing
and category management. We have initiated an analytical approach to support decision making and assess the
impact of pricing and category management across our footprint. With telemetry now equipped on most of our
public PoS, it allows us to analyze sales data and unlock pricing capabilities in ways previously unavailable to us.
We believe this gives us an opportunity to continuously optimize performance, with location specific product
assortment and pricing initiatives, allowing us to better manage margins on underperforming accounts, upsell our
services to B2B customers, and reduce leakage to competing local offerings. We expect pricing and category
management efforts to have a more than €10.0 million impact on revenue for our 2019 fiscal year.

**_Improving Operational Excellence_**

Our route-based business model benefits from the significant increases in productivity resulting from our
dense network of PoS and depots, and we are continuously optimizing route density through professional route
planning. We thereby leverage our focus on technology and innovation to further improve our operational
excellence. For example, the installation of telemetry capabilities in our PoS allows for dynamic route planning
and increased efficiency of our refillers by reducing preparation time and enabling the refiller to visit more PoS.
Density optimization is also a key consideration in our bolt-on acquisition program, and one of the key drivers of
synergy achievement.

Our operational excellence is also driven by our success in acquiring and integrating companies, such as
Pelican Rouge, Argenta and Express Vending. Led by an integration office reporting to the Board of Directors of
the Group, we have identified approximately €75 million in annualized procurement, SG&A and operational
synergies that are at being implemented and that we expect to be fully realized by the end of 2020, resulting in a
strong margin uplift. In terms of procurement, we expect to achieve up to €30 million of annualized synergies
from equipment, ingredients, bought-in goods, disposables, packaging and spares and the in-sourcing of coffee
production. SG&A synergies in an amount of up to €13 million include the consolidation of country and group
headquarters and the optimization of overhead and corporate costs. We expect to achieve up to €33 million of
operational synergies from the transfer of best practices within our group and from an increase in density as a
result of depot, merchandizer and technician network optimization and increase in utilization of telemetry
capabilities, which drives route efficiency for our refillers.

**_Continued Roll Out and Focus on Our Technology and Innovation Capabilities_**

We deem technology and innovation to be a competitive differentiator for our current operations and
business going forward. We continue to commit resources and make the necessary investments to be at the
forefront of technology and innovation in our industry. Currently, we are managing three footprint-wide key
enablers that contribute to an improvement in daily revenue per PoS and operational efficiency. Firstly, we are
expanding and upgrading our current PoS base with telemetry technology, a remote PoS monitoring allowing for
optimization of cost-to-serve and product availability while leading the transformation toward an end-to-end
operating model. Approximately 29% of our eligible PoS park has already been upgraded as of June 30, 2019,
while we aim to roll-out telemetry to all eligible PoS across the footprint. Secondly, we are also upgrading our
PoS to support cashless technology to enhance check-out experience at the point of sale by providing access to
non-cash payment methods, i.e. credit cards and proprietary apps. Approximately 20% of our eligible PoS park
has already been upgraded as of June 30, 2019. Thirdly, our MicroMarket concept allows us to introduce an
innovative, unique, and attractive format bringing together technology, brands, and operational capabilities while


7


-----

combining the classic vending model (convenience) with the cafeteria model (premium and healthy). While the
concept is already established in the UK, Italy, Switzerland and, recently, the Netherlands, we plan to roll-out the
format across our other markets to further expand our current footprint of 104 MicroMarkets as of June 30, 2019.
For example, we have launched our MicroMarket concept in Spain, where we have already entered into
agreements to install MicroMarkets, and in Germany, where we have started discussions with potential
customers.

**_Pursuing Growth Through a Disciplined Capital Expenditure Program_**

We intend to continue to pursue growth through a disciplined capital expenditure program that provides an
attractive return on investment period, while also optimizing the capital intensity of our operations. We have a
structured and consistent governance with respect to capital expenditures across our group, with pre-investments
business cases and post-investment appraisals and tracking of outcomes. At the same time, we are working to
optimize the capital intensity of our operations by refurbishing existing PoS to increase their life and maximizing
our refurbishment capabilities and re-siting underperforming PoS. We also intend to continue exploring
off-balance sheet funding options, such as our alternative arrangements with Lavazza and other leasing
companies, to finance PoS investments for our customers, thereby reducing our initial investment cost for new
client contracts. Innovative route-based solutions such as MicroMarkets also have lower capital expenditure
requirements than classic impulse purchase offerings, while generating two to three times the revenue of a classic
self-service retail site, with each MicroMarket generating an approximate turnover of €50,000 annually. Through
these and other initiatives, we intend to reduce our PoS related cash capital expenditures to under €100.0 million
per year.

**_Engaging in Bolt-On Acquisition Opportunities in Our Fragmented Industry_**

Our reference markets present a fragmented structure with significant bolt-on M&A opportunities, which
would allow us to further strengthen our position as the leading unattended self-service coffee and convenience
food provider in Europe. Given our scale and market knowledge, we continue to see ourselves as a natural
market consolidator. We intend to continue to selectively undertake accretive bolt-on acquisition opportunities to
continue our growth, improve our density and improve our technical as well as service capabilities. The
Unattended SSR Market is characterized by a large number of operators, which on average tend to be very small
in terms of revenue. The following table shows the competitor fragmentation in certain of our key markets:

**Number of** **Average Size of**
**Vending Operators** **Tail [(1)]**

**_€m_**

**~100–150** **5.7**

**~200–250** **0.7**

**~1000–1200** **1.7**

This fragmentation, and our position as the leader in the Unattended SSR Market, provide us with a large
number of bolt-on acquisition opportunities. We have completed five bolt-on acquisitions over the past two
years. Each acquisition we make is underpinned by a clear strategy, whether it be to increase density in existing
regions, develop market shares, expand our portfolio of offerings, improve technical capabilities in specialized
services or some combination of the foregoing. We aim to purchase companies at mid-single-digit EV/EBITDA
multiples, and to extract at least a turn of synergies from those acquisitions. Underpinning our success in bolt-on

acquisitions is a disciplined execution and integration program that has been proven through our track record of
identifying, purchasing at attractive multiples and successfully integrating these bolt-on acquisition opportunities.

**_Developing Our People_**

Our people underlie our success, and we believe that our employees are an integral part in successfully
executing our strategies. To that end, we are undertaking initiatives related to performance management, sales
and operational capabilities, employee engagement and employer branding to ensure we maximize the potential
of our talent across our organization. Included among these initiatives are talent reviews of all teams to provide
improved management of the talent pools within each of our markets. We have developed a sales and operations
academy in order to train and develop our team with the right programs to drive customer satisfaction and
efficiencies. We have also worked to improve our employee on-boarding and performance management for our
field force, with a focus on developing first-line manager capabilities. In terms of employee engagement, we
have created a baseline employee survey in partnership with GALLUP, and plan to implement a tailored action
plan based on the survey results for each team. We are also focused on improving our internal communication
strategy, with improvement of our intranet, implementation of a new ethics program and the publishing of our
first CSR report. We believe that continued implementation of these initiatives, and a focus on the continued
development of our people, will support the execution of our strategies.

**Our History**

Since our founding in Switzerland in 1957, we have grown both organically as well as through acquisitions.
Following our first acquisition in Switzerland in 1959, we expanded into Germany in 1986, Sweden and France
in 1990, Austria, Slovakia and the Baltic countries in 1995, Belgium in 1997, Spain in 1998, the United Kingdom
and Ireland in 2001 and the Netherlands in 2004. In 1985, we were acquired by the Valora group, and, in 1997,
we listed on the SIX before de-listing in 2001. In 2001, we were acquired by the Compass group before
becoming part of Allianz Capital Partners through its acquisition of our business in 2007. We were acquired by
KKR in 2015.

In September 2017, we acquired the Pelican Rouge Group, previously known as Autobar Group Ltd, a
company incorporated in London in 1925, which engages in roasting and blending, packaging, and self-service
retail of coffee in the United Kingdom and internationally. In 2014, Autobar Group changed its name to Pelican
Rouge and relocated to Dordrecht, the Netherlands. The coffee brand Pelican Rouge (Roode Pelikaan) was
originally founded in 1863 in Antwerp.

In February 2018, we acquired the Argenta Group. Since its founding in Carpi, Modena, Italy in 1968, the
Argenta Group has grown organically as well as through acquisitions to become the second largest food and
beverage self-service retail operator in the Italian market. In 2016, the Argenta Group expanded into southern
Italy through the acquisition of Somed, and into the food retail business under the Foodie’s brand and through
agreements with 365 Retail Market with its MicroMarket concept.

In August 2018, we acquired Express Vending, a leading UK supplier of premium self-service retail
services with a focus on London and its neighboring counties. Express Vending’s offering of products and
services includes table top coffee machines and MicroMarkets. Express Vending was established in 1992 and is

**Recent Developments**

**_Current Trading_**

We currently estimate our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the year ended
September 30, 2019, to be in line with our financial guidance publicly disclosed in our quarterly noteholder
presentation for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. As of the date of such noteholder presentation, we
expected our revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to be between €1,615 million and €1,635 million,
between €270 million and €275 million and between €70 million and €80 million, respectively, in each case for
the year ended September 30, 2019. We may not, and do not assume any obligation to, update the current, or
issue future, financial guidance. These preliminary results, estimates, and guidance have not been audited or
reviewed by our auditors, are derived from internal management accounts and are subject to our financial closing
procedures. These procedures have not been completed. While we believe these preliminary results and estimates
to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material and
such results are not indicative of our full year results. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this
information. This information may not be indicative of the remainder of the quarter or any future period.
Financial guidance is inherently uncertain and subject to significant business, economic, currency exchange,
financial, regulatory and competitive risks and our actual financial results could different materially from such
financial guidance, and in any case should not be relied upon in making your investment decision with respect to
the Additional Notes. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors,” and “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Offering Memorandum for a more complete_
discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our future performance.

(2) We are offering €150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes. The Additional Notes will be general, senior secured
obligations of the Issuer and will be issued as additional notes under the Indenture pursuant to which the Existing Notes were issued.

(3) On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by AB Servicios Selecta España SLU, Acorn Spain 1 SLU,

of which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of Guarantees and the rights to the security securing the Notes
and the Guarantees. On the Issue Date, the security interests over the Collateral granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the
Existing Notes will, in each case, be amended, confirmed or extended (as applicable) to include the Additional Notes offered hereby.
Accordingly, the Additional Notes will be secured by the same Collateral as the Existing Notes and will benefit from the proceeds of
enforcement of such Collateral on a pro rata basis with the Existing Notes. See “—The Offering—Security.” For more information on

(4) The Revolving Credit Facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to €150.0 million (equivalent). The Guarantors guarantee the
Revolving Credit Facility, and all or substantially all the same collateral which secures the Notes also secures the Revolving Credit
Facility and certain hedging obligations, in each case on a pari passu basis. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit
_Facility Agreement.” As of June 30, 2019, €106.9 million was drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, which we intend to repay in_
full using a portion of the proceeds from the Offering. See “Use of Proceeds.” Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any
liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and any indebtedness permitted to be
incurred and secured on a super priority basis receives priority in relation to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any
Collateral. Any remaining proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral will be applied pro rata to the repayment
of all obligations under the Indenture and any other senior secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred
and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

(5) As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Guarantors accounted for
approximately 97.7% of the total assets of the Group, approximately 89.8% of the revenue (before the impact of vending fee
harmonization) of the Group and approximately 88.8% of the Adjusted EBITDA. As of June 30, 2019, after giving effect to the
Refinancing, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Additional Notes would have had no material third-party debt outstanding
(excluding financial leases and factoring arrangements).

                         - be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth
under “Description of the Notes—Security”;

existing and future debt that is not subordinated in right of
payment to the Additional Notes (including, the obligations of
the Issuer under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit

                         - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt
that is subordinated in right of payment to the Additional Notes;

                         - be guaranteed by the Guarantors, in each case on a senior
secured basis, which also guarantee the Existing Notes and the
Revolving Credit Facility, as described below under

                         - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future
indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its subsidiaries
(including obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by

of the value of the property or assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness; and

                         - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Issuer (including obligations
to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Notes.

the Issuer;

                         - bank account pledges of the material bank accounts of certain
Guarantors;

                         - intra-group receivables pledges or assignments by way of

interests over the Collateral, holders of Additional Notes will receive
proceeds from the Collateral only after the Revolving Credit Facility,
certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted
to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have
been repaid in full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The security interests may be limited by applicable law or subject to
certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability. For
more information on the security interests granted, see “Description
_of the Notes—Security” and for more information on potential_
limitations to the security interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes.” In addition, the security interests in the_
Collateral may be released under certain circumstances. Subject to the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be
pledged to secure future indebtedness. For more information on the
security interests granted, see “Description of the Notes—Security”
and for more information on potential limitations to the security
interests, see “Certain _Insolvency_ _Law_ _Considerations_ _and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the_
_Notes.”_

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** On or around the Issue Date, we will use the proceeds of the Offering
to: (i) repay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility, (ii) fund excess cash on balance sheet for general corporate

**Optional Redemption:**

Euro Fixed Rate Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes on or

“Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional_ _Redemption—Optional_
_Redemption of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes,” plus accrued and unpaid_
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

Prior to February 1, 2020, the Issuer may on any one or more
occasions redeem up to 40% of the original principal amount of the
Euro Fixed Rate Notes issued under the Indenture (including the
original principal amount of any additional Notes), using the net
proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to
105.875% of the principal amount of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes so
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to, but not including, the applicable date of redemption; provided
that at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Euro Fixed
Rate Notes (including any additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes), issued
under the Indenture (excluding Euro Fixed Rate Notes held by the
Issuer and its subsidiaries) remains outstanding after each such
redemption.

Prior to February 1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes originally
issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional
Notes issued) in each calendar year, commencing on the Issue Date,
at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, up to
the redemption date. See “Description of the Notes—Optional
_Redemption—Optional Redemption of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes.”_


16


-----

In addition, prior to February 1, 2020, the Issuer may redeem all or,
from time to time, part of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes plus the applicable “make-whole” premium described in this
Offering Memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable date of
redemption.

Floating Rate Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may at any time redeem all or part of the Floating Rate
Notes, at the redemption prices set forth under “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption of the Floating_
_Rate Notes,” plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,_
if any, to the date of redemption.

**Additional Amounts; Tax**
**Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** All payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with
respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made without
withholding or deduction for taxes or other governmental charges in
any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes”), except to the extent required by law. If_
any such withholding or deduction is required by law, the Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor will pay additional amounts so that the net
amount you receive is no less than that which you would have
received in the absence of such withholding or deduction, subject to
certain exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—Withholding
_Taxes.”_

If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on the Notes, the Issuer may redeem the
Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. See
“Description of the Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Qualified Reopening** . . . . . . . . . . . . For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Issuer intends to treat the
Additional Notes offered hereby as issued pursuant to a “qualified
reopening” of the Existing Notes. If the issuance of the Additional
Notes offered hereby is so treated, then the Additional Notes offered
hereby will be deemed to have the same issue date, the same issue
price and the same adjusted issue price as the Existing Notes.

Accordingly, the Additional Notes offered hereby will be considered
to be issued at par, even though, considered separately, the Additional
Notes offered hereby might be considered to be issued at a premium
or a discount. See “Certain Taxation Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal_ _Income_ _Tax_ _Considerations—Qualified_ _Reopening_ _and_
_Fungibility with the Existing Notes.”_

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, the Issuer
will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase (subject to the
right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date). A change of
control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified
consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection
with such event. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Tender Offers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** In connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a
tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third
party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding
in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to
the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of

IFRS. Non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to the performance figures published by other companies. You should
exercise caution in comparing non-GAAP measures as reported by us to non-GAAP measures of other companies. For more information,
see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The

(5) We define Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to give effect to the annualized cost savings and
synergies that we have not yet realized and expect to achieve as a result of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and
the Express Vending Acquisition, as set forth in the table below for the periods presented. We believe that Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA
is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and our ability to incur and service our indebtedness. Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is not a performance indicator recognized under IFRS. Non-GAAP measures are not necessarily
comparable to the performance figures published by other companies. You should exercise caution in comparing Non-GAAP measures
as reported by us to Non-GAAP measures of other companies. For more information, see “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Non-GAAP Financial Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The following table is a reconciliation of Adjusted_
EBITDA to Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:

(a) Represents estimated annualized run-rate cost savings and synergies, which we expect to realize as a result of the Pelican Rouge
Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition. In total, we expect to realize approximately €75 million of annualized run-rate cost
synergies from these acquisitions by the end of 2020. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have realized
approximately €52 million of these cost synergies, which represents 69% of our total expected cost synergies. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in_
_connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending_
_Acquisition)” and “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our total estimated cost synergies include the following:_

      - Operating cost savings relating to logistics and footprint optimizations of approximately €33 million, of which we had realized
€18 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized by (i) combining operations in areas with fewer
PoS to reduce the number of employees required to maintain and refill these PoS, (ii) implementing Selecta’s refiller planning
program, which is based on actual sales of each PoS rather than a theoretical model, (iii) cost savings by increasing the use of
telemetry for PoS in France, Spain and the UK (iv) headcount reductions following the assessment of productivity of our
technicians and through the integration of corporate, IT and other central functions, (v) footprint optimization by concentrating
warehouses in the countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate, and (vi) logistics network synergies, including
planning denser and more cost-effective routes.

      - Procurement savings of approximately €30 million, of which we had realized €22 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings
are currently being realized by (i) obtaining better prices on ingredients through in-sourcing of our own brand coffee from
Pelican Rouge’s roaster facility and international tender of raw materials used across the countries in which we operate, such as
sugar, (ii) harmonizing prices of products we purchase for our PoS (such as snacks or cold drinks) by leveraging our scale and
negotiating prices through strategic relationships at the Group level, (iii) savings on disposables, such as cups for our PoS, and
packaging through leveraging our increased purchasing volume at the Group level, (iv) streamlining purchases of spare parts
for our machines, (v) indirect cost savings on our fleet, IT, marketing, and warehouses, and (vi) real estate savings as a result of
terminating redundant leases and renegotiating existing leases.

      - Selling, general, and administrative cost savings of approximately €13 million, of which we had realized €12 million as of
June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized through (i) headcount reductions as a result of integrating
management teams in countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate and re-sizing our sales force, (ii) savings in
connection with headcount reductions in the research and development department of the Group by leveraging Argenta’s
research and development expertise, (iii) reductions in employee benefit expenses, such as cars, travel, and mobile phones, in
connection with headcount reductions, (iv) combining headquarters in countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate,
and (v) additional productivity gains in sales, general and administrative costs.

As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have incurred approximately €25 million in costs and capital expenditures to implement
the foregoing synergies, and estimate that we will incur approximately €28 million in further costs and capital expenditures to


25


-----

realize our total targeted cost synergies. In particular, we expect to incur (i) total estimated severance costs of approximately
€24 million, of which approximately €10 million have already been incurred as of June 30, 2019, and (ii) estimated integration costs
of approximately €29 million, of which approximately €14 million have already been incurred as of June 30, 2019.

Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected synergies reflected above, no assurance can be given that such levels will be
achieved in the timeframe indicated or at all or that additional unanticipated costs will not arise. We currently estimate the majority of the
cost to achieve the anticipated synergies to be personnel reductions and related costs that may be required under the laws of the various
countries where we operate, which we expect to continue incurring over the course of the next one to two years. As part of our
reorganization plan, we are required to negotiate severance payments with worker representatives (labor unions) for FTEs being made
redundant pursuant to a collective dismissal procedure provided under applicable regulations in various of the countries where we
operate. While we fully intend to observe the relevant legal procedures and requirements and to negotiate in good faith, if we cannot
reach an agreement on severance payments with such worker representatives or the employees, they may choose to bring administrative
or judicial challenges, which could delay the achievement of our synergies and/or increase costs incurred in order to achieve such
synergies. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and our
judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to
significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those
contained in the synergy benefit estimates, including those described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be
_able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge_
_Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition).” See also “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

(1) Daily revenue per PoS is calculated based on constant scope and constant currency rates as set forth under “Presentation of Financial
_and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Information—Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information.” We calculate_
our daily revenue per PoS based on the weighted average number of days in a relevant period based on revenue per business channel.
Calculation is performed by business channel in each country in which we operate, adjusting the number of days in the workplace
channel for weekends/public holidays in the relevant country, resulting in the number of effective days for the workplace channel being
lower than for our on-the-go business channel. For our on-the-go business channel, we use 365 days as PoS are available every day of the
year.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Additional Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information_
_contained in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before_
_purchasing the Additional Notes. The risks and uncertainties that we describe below are not the only ones we_
_face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial_
_could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If any of_
_the possible events described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be_
_materially and adversely affected. If that happens, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the_
_Additional Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-_
_Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Changes in general economic conditions, consumer confidence and consumer spending could have an adverse_**
**_effect on our business._**

Demand for snacks, hot and cold beverages and in-between meals correlates with consumer confidence and
employment levels. Changes in general economic conditions directly impact consumer confidence and consumer
spending, as well as the general business climate. Therefore, our results of operations and financial performance
are subject to changes in the general economic conditions of the markets in which we sell our products. In
particular, changes in consumer confidence and consumer spending as a consequence of changes to general
economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business. Moreover, consumer confidence,
consumer spending and general economic conditions may deteriorate significantly and remain depressed for an
extended period. A negative development in general economic conditions or consumer confidence and consumer
spending could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Downturns in general economic conditions and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects, which
affect consumers’ disposable income, pose a risk to our business because consumers and businesses may adjust
their spending in response to tighter credit markets, unemployment, negative financial news or declines in
income or asset values, which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products. Many factors
affect discretionary spending, including general business conditions, inflation, interest rates, consumer debt
levels, unemployment rates, foreign currency exchange rates and availability of consumer credit. These and other
such macroeconomic factors are outside our control.

Recessionary conditions and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment may also adversely influence
our customers’ decision to contract for a self-service PoS on their premises as well as consumers’ discretionary
consumption patterns. A majority of our PoS are located in office environments or other private self-service retail
locations. Consequently, the majority of our sales from such PoS occur during the working week. There is
therefore a correlation between the total number of items sold through our PoS and work force levels and the
total number of hours worked which tend to suffer during recessionary periods. Additionally, general strikes by
employees, particularly temporary halts in public transport, would reduce the exposure of our PoS to consumers
and decrease our sales volume. For example, during the railway strikes in France we estimate our revenue from
those points of sale declined by approximately €3 million between March and July 2018 compared to the same
period in 2017. Employee retrenchment, strikes, or uncertain economic prospects may lead customers to decide
against investing in PoS and may lead consumers to make fewer beverage, snack and impulse purchases from our
PoS, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The success of our business depends on consumer preferences, technological innovations and the consumer’s_**
**_experience with the self-service PoS we operate._**

We are a route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider operating in the highly
competitive segments of the food and beverage market serving hot and cold beverages, in-between meals, snacks,
and confectionary products. Changes in consumer preferences could affect both the demand for new PoS and the
volume of products we sell from our PoS. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or our inability to
anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our
competitive and financial position. Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends, including

29


-----

changing tastes, food fads and concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, and product
attributes and ingredients, as well as our ability to address special dietary requirements or preferences. In
addition, changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand
for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including a preference for healthy
eating, sustainable packaging, the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, changes in travel,
workplace, vacation or leisure activity patterns, weather, or negative publicity arising from environmental
concerns, or resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in the snack food and beverage
industries. Furthermore, as millennials begin to form larger portions of the consumer pool, adapting our sales and
marketing strategies to complement their purchasing habits will become increasingly important to our business.
Any of these or other changes may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the products we sell and may
require us to incur unplanned costs to respond to these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, existing technologies may develop further in the fields where we operate, which could impact
our business and require significant investments. For example, wireless technology has developed as a practical
medium through which cashless payments can be made. Furthermore, the ability to transmit sales and stock data
remotely (telemetry) has led to significant developments in the industry. Other technological advances are also
likely to become more widespread, including payments via mobile phone, PoS equipped with internet browsers,
PoS that speak to the visually impaired as well as environmentally friendly PoS, which use less energy. If we are
unable to adopt such advances in technology, our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations
may be adversely affected. Moreover, our continued success is also dependent on product innovation, both in
terms of sourcing more technologically advanced PoS as well as new food and beverage products from suppliers.
Responding to technological changes regularly requires capital expenditures, which could be above our
management’s expectations or may strain our cash flow position and may not be fully recoverable from revenue
streams created by such expenditures. Additionally, we are organized on a decentralized geographic basis, which
can delay or prevent successful implementation of group-wide roll-outs of the above projects. There can be no
assurance that we can acquire or successfully implement new models or variants of existing PoS models or that
we will be successful in stocking such PoS with the products that will be most appealing to consumers.

Furthermore, our success is dependent on the consumer’s experience with the PoS we operate. To generate
revenue and profits, we must stock food and beverage products that appeal to consumer preferences in PoS that
consistently and reliably dispense the products we offer. If consumers encounter PoS that contain undesirable
products, have been vandalized, or malfunction, our reputation may suffer and consumers may no longer seek to
patronize our PoS, leading to a decline in revenue, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is exposed to fluctuations in costs related to fuel, coffee and other commodity prices._**

Our business operations rely on frequent restocking and maintenance of PoS at numerous locations. As a
result, we are exposed to fluctuations in costs related to fuel and other transportation inputs. In addition, we
source significant amounts of coffee at the Group level for the operation of our coffee machines and roaster
facilities, including our own Pelican Rouge and Miofino brands of coffee blends. Supply and price of coffee
beans can be affected by multiple factors, such as weather, pest damage, politics, competitive pressures and
economies of the producing countries. The price of green bean coffee has fluctuated significantly in recent years.
For example, the price of arabica coffee increased by more than 100% from November 2013 to April 2014 and
prices ranged from U.S.$2.30 per pound in October 2011 to U.S.$1.09 per pound in October 2018 (based on the
ICE ‘C’ New York index). In the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we spent €43.2 million on green coffee
beans at our roaster, which accounted for 8.3% of our costs of material and consumables. We manage the risk of
fluctuation in commodity prices by partly hedging the price of coffee beans. While our hedging strategy enables
us to partly mitigate adverse effects of coffee beans price fluctuations over a certain period, it does not allow us
to mitigate the risks associated with the valuation of hedging instruments, which may become too expensive due
to commodity prices fluctuations, and the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also procure food and
beverage products from suppliers, the costs of which are indirectly linked to fluctuations in the prices of certain
commodities such as cocoa and sugar. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in passing on cost
increases to customers or consumers without losses in revenue or gross margin. As a consequence, sudden and
significant changes in the prices of coffee and other commodities could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in governmental regulations and legislation may subject us to new and onerous obligations._**

The food and beverage industry is regulated by various European and national legislation and regulations
covering food safety and hygiene, packaging, nutritional information, broader public health and diet concerns,
and public tenders for placement of self-service PoS on public premises. For example, EU Regulation 852/2004
sets out general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs and EU Regulation 853/2004
regulates, among other things, the temperature settings of PoS that stock products made from or containing
animal products, such as meats and cheeses. We may also be subject to new or additional UK regulations
following Brexit (as defined herein). See “—The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European
_Union may have a negative effect on our business.” Moreover, as governments target lowering obesity rates and_
obesity-related illnesses, sales of certain snack foods will become discouraged. In the UK, for example, in order
to qualify for government funding, National Health Services, including hospital premises must comply with
certain standards, including a ban on the price promotion, advertisement, and sale of food and drinks that are
high in fat, salt, sugar, and saturates, and provision of healthy food and drinks options to patients and staff at all
times. Although regulations such as the above do not directly regulate our business, our customers will require us
to provide them with a product mix that ensures their compliance with such regulations and will not consider
suppliers who cannot provide the appropriate products. Moreover, as government standards for food quality
increase, our suppliers’ production costs of such items, including organic products, also increase; these increases
are passed up the chain to the consumers, which could lead to lower sale volumes.

In April 2016, the United Kingdom government announced the introduction of a National Living Wage,
which replaced the national minimum wage for people aged 25 and over in the United Kingdom. The National
Minimum Wage remained in place for all working people under the age of 25 who are at least school leaving age
in the United Kingdom. In April 2019, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the
United Kingdom to 18 was increased to £4.35 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for
people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 24 increased to £6.15 per hour and £7.70 per hour respectively,
while the National Living Wage for people aged 25 and over was increased to £8.21 per hour. As we employ
some of our staff at the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, any further increase in the
National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, or their scope, could increase our operating costs. In
addition, individuals may be subject to criminal prosecution for deliberately not complying with the legislation
and anyone found guilty may be disqualified from being a company director for up to 15 years. Additionally, in
order to remain competitive, we strive to pay our workers at slightly higher rates than the National Minimum
Wage and the National Living Wage. As minimum wage rates increase, we may increase the wages of our higher
paid employees in line with increases granted to our minimum wage employees. These higher labor costs could
have a material adverse effect on our profitability. While we cannot be certain how this will affect our business,
an increase in the minimum wage rate paid to certain workers will increase our labor costs, which, in turn, could
have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, stricter requirements regarding energy consumption of our PoS and the use of recyclable or
biodegradable containers in connection with our coffee machines could adversely affect our business operations.
Compliance with such laws and regulations could require us to make additional investments in new PoS and
equipment, and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines and other remedial measures. For
example, our PoS in Germany must be accompanied with a space for consumers to recycle their used coffee
cups; the failure to provide recycling facilities can result in fines from the German regulator. In addition, the UK
has indicated it intends to add new levies in regards to plastic packaging, which could include a tax on the use of
plastic cups in our PoS. Were the UK or other jurisdictions to impose taxes on the use of plastic cups this could
result in significant additional costs and may decrease the profitability of our products. Any such changes in
regulations or costs incurred to comply with stricter regulations could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We are also required to obtain and comply with numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from
the respective government authorities of each jurisdiction in which we operate, in relation to health, safety
(including the security of our facilities) and environmental regulations. The process of obtaining and renewing
necessary permits can be lengthy and complex. In addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial,
revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of
permits or approvals, or failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or
temporary suspension of our operations and sales and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. For
example, we operate a 14,000 square meter coffee roasting facility in Dordrecht, the Netherlands. Given its
potential impact on the environment, this facility qualifies as a type B facility under Dutch environmental laws.
This qualification does not require us to obtain an environmental operating permit (omgevingsvergunning milieu)

31


-----

to carry out our activities but requires us to do an annual assessment to confirm this type B status. If we are
unable to confirm this status and are required to obtain an operating permit, and if we are unable to obtain this
permit, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, complying with new legislation or regulations, or changed interpretations of existing
legislations or regulations, may require us to incur significant expense. For example, a recent preliminary court
judgment in California concluded that companies are required to give consumers clear and reasonable warning
about the presence of high levels of acrylamide in coffee products, that is considered toxic and carcinogenic and
that it can impact the consumer’s health. Should similar judgments or regulatory requirements become applicable
in the jurisdictions we operate, it could result in an increase in our operating costs to comply with such
regulations as well as negatively affect the public perception of the consumption of coffee, potentially having a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “—Any negative impact
_on the reputation of the brand names of certain of the key products we sell may adversely affect our competitive_
_position.” We cannot predict the amounts of any increases in capital expenditures or operating costs that we may_
incur to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or whether we will be able to pass on these costs to our
consumers through price increases. Additionally, any tightening of regulations applicable to certain materials and
processes that we use could force us to use more expensive processes and decrease the profitability of our
products. Any failure to obtain or comply with required permits and approvals for our operations, or the possible
imposition of fines or undertaking of capital investments in the aforementioned cases, could have a materially
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We operate in a highly competitive market, and if we do not compete effectively, we may lose market share or_**
**_be unable to maintain or increase prices for our products and services._**

The market in which we operate is highly competitive. Depending on location, our self-service PoS
compete, in terms of product selection and price with a combination of cafés, kiosks, fast-food restaurants,
delicatessens, sandwich shops, gas stations, convenience stores, and supermarkets, among others. In office
locations we also compete with coffee machine manufacturers who offer office coffee services and may seek to
expand in that market segment. As a result of this competitive environment, our suppliers will have multiple
channels through which they can sell and distribute products, which gives them significant bargaining
advantages. Furthermore, an increase in the number of alternative locations in close proximity to our PoS that
sell the same or similar products that we sell through our PoS, or the extension of the opening hours of such
locations, would increase the competitive environment and could result in consumers purchasing similar food
and beverage products through other channels. For example, in recent years, the number of mobile kiosks and
small shops selling coffee and snack foods in train stations where we operate has significantly increased. These
alternative outlets can also reduce our coffee sales in offices, as consumers can instead buy their coffee on the
commute to work. In addition, if the train or metro platforms on which we have public contracts to operate are
under construction for extended periods of time, consumers may become accustomed to purchasing coffee from
one of our competitors.

In general, the self-service retail operator sector is characterized by extensive logistics, distribution, and
maintenance service requirements. Although the Unattended SSR Market is currently fragmented, future
consolidation in the industry among existing operators could adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Certain competitors, such as Nespresso, may have greater capital and other resources and superior brand
recognition relative to us and may be able to provide more sophisticated PoS or adopt more aggressive pricing
policies. In addition, certain competitors may enter into partnership agreements with producers of well-known
coffee brands that may further increase competition with our products. For example, in August 2018 Nestlé,
which owns Nespresso, entered into a global licensing arrangement with Starbucks that would give Nespresso the
right to market Starbucks’ coffee in retail outlets globally outside the café chain. Moreover, certain competitors
such as Coca-Cola, develop, own, and operate their own PoS, which may have superior functionality to our PoS
at a lower cost to our customers. Also, in January 2019 Coca-Cola completed the acquisition of Costa coffee
chain from Whitbread, and in December 2018 Lavazza bought an arm of Mars Drinks including the single-serve
Flavia machine and the Klix freestanding machine business. These competitors may be able to undertake more
extensive marketing campaigns, secure the most advantageous locations for their PoS or otherwise make more
attractive offers to customers and consumers. New market entrants in a particular market segment, such as Café
Royal in the coffee procurement, roasting, and packaging segment, could also increase competition in
procurement for and sale of coffee from our coffee roasting segment. New market entrants in a particular country
or region could also lead to oversaturation in the market, limiting our growth potential in that area. There can be

32


-----

no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in our market and a loss in market share or other
factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Further, we partner from time to time with caterers and facility management companies to place our PoS in
facilities where they operate. Facility management companies are appointed to manage the catering and other
food and beverage suppliers of large offices and companies. If a caterer or facility management company
establishes a formal partnership with another self-service retail operator or decides to operate the PoS business
themselves, our sales could be negatively affected. For example, our business in the UK may suffer if one of our
facility management customers, Compass, successfully creates its own self-service retail services. Furthermore,
facility management companies generally have a strong impact on our pricing in the private sector due to their
function as the intermediary between us and the customer. They typically demand lower prices in order to retain
the flexibility of adding their own margins to the final price, and to ensure the provision of the lowest price to
their customers. If their price reduction requirements are not met, they may grant the business to other caterers
and machine manufacturers. In addition, these contracts require a combination of business development and
international customer management. Our business operates on an internationally decentralized basis and our
teams may not be able to coordinate efficiently to address the needs of our customers. Any failure to maintain our
contracts with such catering or facility management companies could have a materially adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our ability to maintain or increase prices in response to competitive pressures may also be limited.
Additionally, increasing operating costs, including vending fees with certain customers, may offset increases in
margins that rising prices might otherwise produce. As a result, we cannot assure you that competitive dynamics
will not require us to make investments in our PoS park, or that we will be able to increase prices with sufficient
flexibility and speed to preserve or increase our margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_An increase in vending fee rates could negatively affect our business._**

We are generally required to pay vending fees to place our PoS in public locations, such as airports and train
and subway stations and, in certain cases, corporate locations. Our customers may increase the vending fees we
pay to place our PoS on their premises in the future. If these vending fees increase or we are unable to respond
effectively, including if we are unable to pass on the full extent of the increases to our customers, our
profitability could suffer and we may fail to retain or win new customers. Our vending fee arrangements include
fixed and variable rent agreements or combinations thereof, and are based on certain factors including, among
others, public tender specifications, expected revenue, contract length, competitors’ offers and the demographics
of the relevant location. An increase in vending fee payable to our customers could significantly increase our
operating expenses in future periods, and as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our success is dependent, in part, upon the integrity of our management and employees, and our risk_**
**_management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law, including mishandling of cash._**

Our business operations involve risks associated with fraud, bribery and corruption, or allegations thereof,
including with respect to our own employees as well as our customers and the award of public tenders by public
authorities to offer self-service retail services. In particular, our business operations involve the transfer of large
volumes of cash between locations, which exposes us to the risk of loss or theft. We are subject to various legal
and regulatory requirements and risks in the countries in which we have facilities or operations, involving
compliance with the UK Bribery Act 2010, European Anti-Bribery Conventions and other similar laws, generally
prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes
of obtaining or retaining business. Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient in order
to prevent or detect inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law by our management, employees, agents or
contractors. For example, the cash collection process is performed by employees or by third party service
providers, with either centralized or decentralized cash control supervisory teams, depending on the country,
whose methods may lack adequacy in detecting mishandling of cash. Compliance and controls systems of certain
countries may be incomplete, unreliable, or inaccurately transmit data due either to technical shortcomings which
may or not be in our control, or malicious efforts of internal staff and third parties. Such malicious efforts include
manual input of cash data in systems and are exacerbated by poor or inconsistent control execution from branch
to branch within a country. Therefore, we may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of theft, fraud,
bribery and corruption involving our employees, management, directors, agents, contractors or other third parties

33


-----

in the future. To the extent we are not successful in protecting ourselves from such activities, we may be subject
to civil and criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences. Allegations,
proceedings and convictions of certain crimes including, among others, fraud, bribery and corruption may make
it more difficult for us to obtain or acquire new customers or render us ineligible to participate in public tenders.
The involvement or association of our employees, management, directors, agents or contractors with theft, fraud,
bribery or corruption and other crimes committed in relation to our activities, or allegations or rumors relating
thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_A failure of our key information technology, accounting software, cyber security, and inventory management_**
**_systems or processes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business._**

We rely extensively on information technology, external logistics providers, and other processes for our
day-to-day operations. These systems and processes include, but are not limited to, route-planning, ordering and
managing stock from suppliers, coordinating the logistics of restocking our PoS, distributing products to various
locations, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory,
legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. If such systems are damaged or
cease to function properly, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations, which could
negatively affect our revenue and results of operations by impeding our ability to distribute products and restock
our PoS. These interruptions could be caused by any number of events, including catastrophic events, power
outages, security breaches, disruptions at our data maintenance suppliers, or our experienced IT employees being
unavailable or ceasing to work for us. Moreover, because consumer decisions to purchase snack food and
beverages are contextually specific and can change on a day-to-day basis (or even during the course of a day), a
lost vend due to a PoS malfunction or a lack of stock cannot typically be recouped once the malfunction has been
addressed or the PoS has been restocked. Additionally, if we are found to not be in compliance with the license
requirements of our software providers or other third parties, they may bring claims against us and terminate our
licensing agreements with them. Failures in our systems could therefore reduce our revenue, adversely affect our
reputation among our customers and consumers generally, compromise our competitive position or otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to equip our PoS with telemetry in the near future is integral to our success. We expect many of
our largest customers, including Shell and FM, will require real-time sales data in order to improve their
consumer understanding and to test our ability to provide effective 24/7 customer service. Therefore, our
successful roll-out of telemetry equipped PoS will be crucial to maintaining some of our largest customers. As of
June 30, 2019, we have equipped approximately 29% of our eligible PoS park with telemetry, and expect to
complete this roll-out by 2022.

Additionally, our exposure to the risk of cyber security breaches, internal security breaches or other
unauthorized or accidental access to the servers, other information systems or databases which we control or
have access to is heightened when we transmit information over the internet or introduce new, or make changes
or upgrades to existing products and services or servers, other information systems, or databases.

Furthermore, a significant number of our existing IT systems are nearing the end of their economic life and
some of our IT systems lack the technology and automation which is becoming standard across our industry. For
example, our internal IT systems do not interface among each other, we are missing certain system controls at a
central level and we regularly experience control deficiencies throughout our business, which we have currently
addressed through manual controls. Manual controls, as opposed to IT based controls, are costly and inefficient
as they do not provide an appropriate level of risk mitigation in regards to fraudulent behavior. Additionally,
some of our outdated custom made applications are no longer supported and cannot be developed further
internally. Because of outdated IT systems, many of our internal reports have been prepared based on data
extracted from systems and processed manually. Inappropriate handling of spreadsheets containing calculations
may result in misstatements and our existing IT may not provide management with data in an adequate and
consistent form, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may not successfully implement our business strategies, including achieving our growth objectives._**

We may not be able to fully implement our business strategies or realize, in whole or in part within the
expected timeframe, the anticipated benefits of our various growth or other initiatives. Our various business
strategies and initiatives, including further increasing our market leadership with customers and consumers as
well as delivering efficient high quality service, are subject to significant business, economic and competitive
uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control.

34


-----

In addition, we expect to incur certain costs to achieve efficiency improvements and growth in our business
and we may exceed the expected costs or timeframes, which would adversely affect our ability to realize
anticipated synergies or efficiencies. In addition, an inability to achieve such improvements could adversely
impact our customer retention or our operations. Also, our business strategies may change from time to time in
light of our ability to implement our new business initiatives, competitive pressures, economic uncertainties or
developments, or other factors.

**_We may incur civil and criminal liability due to infringements of the European General Data Protection_**
**_Regulation._**

The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (or “GDPR”) came into effect on May 25, 2018,
and includes various requirements for data protection, in particular (without limitation) for international data
transfers, data mapping and accountability, processor (service provider) obligations, and the requirement to
designate a data protection officer. Due to its extraterritorial scope of application, it also applies to entities
outside the EU (e.g. to our Swiss business), when processing personal data from data subjects in the EU.

The implementation of these requirements of the GDPR put a significant burden on our legal and
compliance functions. The task to meet all the GDPR requirements on an ongoing basis is relatively complex.
While our operating companies are all currently located in the EU (subject to the outcome of Brexit), the EEA or
in a country that has an adequate level of data protection pursuant to an EU Commission decision, and we do not
face the implications associated with the intra-group data transfer to the so-called “third countries” (according to
art. 44 et seqq. GDPR), we can, nevertheless, not guarantee that our operations are at all times in compliance
with all the requirements of the GDPR (and its implementing ordinances by Member States). To the extent that
we violate the requirements set out in the GDPR, sanctions may be imposed. These sanctions depend on the
nature of the infringed provision and may consist in civil liabilities and criminal sanctions. Criminal sanctions
can include fines of up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding
financial year, whichever is higher, for each infraction. Additional penalties may apply, such as the deprivation
of profits. Our failure to implement the GDPR (including the implementing rules of the EU Member States)
could significantly affect our reputation and relationships with our customers, and civil and criminal liabilities
for the infringement of data protection rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may incur civil and criminal liability due to infringements of the Swiss Data Protection Act and other_**
**_applicable data protection laws relating to theft, loss, or misuse of data relating to our employees, customers or_**
**_other third parties._**

The theft, loss or misuse of data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result
in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Swiss and other applicable data
protection legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex
compliance regulatory environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data
protection measures could be significant. In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with privacy-related
or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others,
including our employees or customers, which could negatively affect our reputation, customer relationships, as
well as have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Also the pending amendment of the Swiss Data Protection Act, which will enter into force in 2020 at the
earliest, may lead to more strict data protection requirements and more severe consequences in case of breach.
According to the latest draft of the Swiss Data Protection Act, fines will be limited to CHF 250,000 and shall be
imposed on individuals and not on entities (the liable person shall be assessed on a case by case basis, e.g.
directors, data protection officer or employees responsible for data protection). However the new law may entail
complex technical changes and significant investments. In addition, we do not have data security insurance
coverage and our liability insurance does not grant any coverage for claims arising out of, based upon or in
connection with a breach of our data security system. Should one or more of these risks materialize, it could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_Defects, failures or security breaches in and inadequate upgrades of, or changes to, our PoS and the_**
**_accompanying software could harm our business._**

The operation of our business depends on sophisticated software, hardware, computer networking and
communication services that may contain undetected errors or may be subject to failures or complications. These

35


-----

errors, failures or complications may arise particularly when new, changed or enhanced products or services are
added. Future upgrades, improvements or changes that may be necessary to expand and maintain our business
may not be timely or appropriately implemented. The security of our customer and consumer data depends on
our PoS and the accompanying software adequately functioning. Despite our security measures, including any
necessary upgrades, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to attacks, hackers or experience other
cyber security breaches as a result of employee error. Such breaches may result in the public disclosure, loss or
theft of proprietary information or of consumer financial information. Further, certain aspects of the operating
systems relating to our business are provided by third parties, including telecommunications and payment
processing. Accordingly, the effectiveness of these operating systems is, to a certain degree, dependent on the
actions and decisions of third parties over whom we may have limited control. Any of the above failures could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of the brand names of certain of the key products we sell may adversely_**
**_affect our competitive position._**

We stock and sell in our PoS a broad range of brand name products whose brands are owned by our
suppliers or other third parties, such as Starbucks. We are dependent on the Starbucks and the Lavazza brands for
the success of our business but we have limited control over these and other brands we supply to our customers.
Any failure on the part of the owners of such brands to defend their intellectual property rights or preserve and
build their brands’ reputations could compromise such reputations or the public’s perception of such brands,
thereby diminishing the value of such brands and potentially having a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we have entered into partnership agreements in
connection with certain of our offerings, such as our partnership with 365 Retail Market, a self-checkout
workplace technology provider offering fresh food, among other products. While food safety is a top priority for
us and we strive to ensure that consumers enjoy safe, quality food products, claims of illness or injury relating to
food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry. Because we purchase prepared food from
our suppliers, food safety could be out of our control, and we rely on suppliers and distributors to label and
transport food in accordance with the relevant food safety regulations. Regardless of the source or cause, any
report of food-borne illness or other food safety issues such as food tampering or contamination at one of our
locations could adversely impact our reputation across our brand. Furthermore, any negative impact on the
reputation of our partners could also have a negative effect on our reputation and products, and as a consequence
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, we have built a reputation for our own brands, such as Pelican Rouge and Miofino, for
delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience. To be successful in the future, we believe we must
preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Our business strategy relies
significantly on the success of the brands in our existing and new markets. Business incidents, whether isolated
or recurring, that erode consumer trust, such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy, contaminated food,
employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, product recalls or other potential
incidents discussed in this “Risk Factors” section, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity,
including rapidly through social or digital media, or result in litigation, and any failure to respond promptly and
appropriately to these incidents, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

The sale of any of the third party products in our PoS or the coffee from our coffee roasting facility can also
give rise to product liability claims against us. Such claims, especially with regards to our roasting facility
products, can be very costly to defend and involve large damages. Product liability claims could harm our
reputation, regardless of the merit or ultimate success of the claim, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position and results of operations.

Consumer demand for our products and our brands could diminish significantly if we fail to preserve the
quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, including with
respect to the sourcing, disposal, content or sale of our products or the use of consumer data, failure to comply
with laws and regulations or failure to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our
markets. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brands and other intellectual property assets, as well as failure to
protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brands or other intellectual property
assets, can erode consumer trust and our brands’ value and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

**_The performance of our business is negatively affected by VAT rates on food and beverage items sold in our_**
**_PoS and any further increase in VAT could require us to incur additional costs and have an adverse effect on_**
**_our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Any of the countries in which we operate may adopt new tax laws or modify existing laws to increase taxes,
especially VAT rates, applicable to the products that consumers purchase from our PoS. For example, as of
January 1, 2014, the Italian VAT rate applicable to PoS products increased from 4.0% to 10.0%. In addition, as
of the same date, the French VAT rate applicable to confectionary items increased from 19.6% to 20.0% and to
hot drinks rose from 7.0% to 10.0% (but decreased from 5.5% to 5.0% for canned beverages). Moreover, as
healthy eating becomes a larger priority for government authorities, the prices of our product offering may
increase due to any taxes imposed to discourage consumers from purchasing such items. The UK, for example,
has begun to impose an additional tax on soft drinks in 2018, and may consider introducing a tax on single-use
plastic waste, which may negatively affect the sales volumes for, or reduce our margins on, our cold beverages.

VAT increases affect the prices consumers pay for food and beverage items, and therefore reduces their
purchasing power, especially if it coincides with a decline in economic conditions or high levels of
unemployment. As a self-service retail operator, we are obliged to respond to VAT rate increases by discussing
with our customers the re-pricing of the food and beverage items sold in a PoS on their premises. As many of our
contracts are based on a fixed price per product and do not contain automatic pass-through mechanisms, our
regional and area managers must engage with customers to reach an agreement. An increase in VAT rates
typically reduces our margins on contracts with a fixed output price, as the output VAT is already included in the
selling price. Following any agreement to raise selling prices, our PoS operators must re-price items on display in
our PoS. For automatic PoS equipped with digital price displays, this may be relatively simple, however, for the
majority of our PoS base with conventional displays, re-pricing has cost and time implications.

Accordingly, any future increase of VAT in a market where we operate, especially under a fixed price
agreement, may negatively affect our revenue and increase our operating costs and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates._**

Changes to currency exchange rates may impact our profitability. For example, a significant strengthening
of the euro compared to the pound sterling or to the Swiss franc could have an adverse effect on our operating
results and financial condition, particularly in relation to the price of certain raw materials upon which we rely.
Moreover, we may be unable to pass along increased costs to our customers or our customers may be less willing
to purchase our products at higher prices. Conversely, our customers may demand that we reduce our prices
where any changes in currency exchange rates may have been beneficial to our operations. Any increased costs
or reduced revenue as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a result of the international nature of our operations, we are subject to foreign exchange risk, including
currency translation, transactional and operating exposure. In particular, the exchange rates between the euro and
the pound sterling or to the Swiss franc have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. As
we report in euro, we are subject to risks relating to the conversion into euros of the statements of financial
position and income statements of our subsidiaries who conduct business in Swiss franc, Danish and Norwegian
krone, Swedish krona, and pound sterling. In addition, we are subject to risks arising from outstanding nominal
foreign currency financial and trade receivables or payables incurred prior to but due to be settled after a change
to the relevant exchange rate, which affect our current cash flows.

A weakening of one or more of the foreign currencies in which we operate against the euro necessarily
reduces our euro-denominated revenue. As a large portion of our expenses are borne in euro, a depreciation of
the pound sterling, Swiss franc, Danish or Norwegian krone, or Swedish krona against the euro would decrease
our profitability. Alternatively, such changes in currency exchange rates may have a long-term impact on
demand for our products as we may become less competitive outside the euro zone due to the higher prices that
customers and consumers outside the euro zone may have to pay for our products.

We may not be able to manage effectively the currency risks we face, and volatility in currency exchange
rates may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements and may have a materially
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We face various political, economic, legal, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with_**
**_conducting business in multiple countries._**

Our business and results of operations are subject to various risks inherent in international operations over
which we have little or no control. These risks include, among others:

   - transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels and suppliers;

   - longer payment cycles for and greater difficulty collecting customer accounts receivable;

   - the ability to finance our foreign operations;

   - fluctuations in currency exchange and currency controls;

   - economic downturns in countries or geographic regions where our manufacturers are located which
among other things may expose the operations of our manufacturers to risks, leading to an increase in
our manufacturing costs or delayed delivery;

   - trade restrictions, higher tariffs and changes to existing, or the imposition of additional, regulations
relating to import or export of our products;

   - unfavorable changes in tax or other laws, including the imposition of new laws or regulations that
restrict our operations or increase our cost of operations;

   - work stoppages and sudden or unexpected increases in wages;

   - political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of
trade and other business restrictions; and

   - difficulties in obtaining the protections of the intellectual property laws of other countries.

The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are
unpredictable; however, the effects of any of these occurrences, or any combination thereof, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We depend on a limited number of suppliers for the manufacture of self-service retail machines and the_**
**_provision of telemetry equipment we require to operate our business._**

Although we have limited in-house refurbishment and customization capabilities, we do not manufacture
our PoS. We source substantially all of our PoS from 16 key suppliers, with the majority of our PoS sourced
through our largest supplier for the year ended September 30, 2018. We currently, and will increasingly, rely on
such manufacturers to produce high-quality machines in adequate quantities to meet customers’ demands. If one
or more of our PoS manufacturers were to experience severe financial difficulties or cease operations, our ability
to source new PoS or component parts could be disrupted and a prolonged interruption could have a significant
adverse effect on our business. Any decline in quality, disruption in production or inability of the manufacturers
to produce the machines we require in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner, whether as a result of a natural
disaster, labor strikes, financial difficulties or other causes, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the provision of necessary telemetry software and
hardware. As access to sales data derived from the use to telemetry becomes standard in the business, customer
expectations for the service has also increased. Therefore, if one or more of our telemetry equipment providers
cease to operate for any reason, including bankruptcy or other financial difficulties, we may not be able to
continue to provide this service to our customers. The inability to provide such services may lead to the loss of
certain of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Disruptions in our supply and logistics chain could adversely affect us._**

A disruption in our supply and logistics chain caused by transportation disruptions, delays or increased
expenses, labor strikes, product recalls or other unforeseen events could adversely affect our ability to restock our
PoS or repair, maintain and retrofit our PoS. If we cannot secure alternative sources of supply or effectively
manage a disruption if it occurs, daily vends and thereby revenue could be reduced until we are able to address
the situation and we are unlikely to recoup the loss of such vends. See “—A failure of our key information
_technology, accounting software, cyber security, and inventory management systems or processes could have a_

38


-----

_material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.” These events could cause our revenue to decline,_
require additional resources to restore our supply and logistics chain or otherwise could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business requires capital expenditures that may divert significant cash flow from other investments or_**
**_uses, including debt servicing._**

As of June 30, 2019, we owned and operated a network of more than 475,000 active coffee, convenience
food and beverage PoS. As part of our business model, we acquire new PoS for new customer sites, refurbish our
existing PoS and replace those that reach obsolescence from our existing installed PoS base. Following the
Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition, we expect our capital
expenditures related to the purchase of additional vehicles, IT systems, other equipment, and new PoS to remain
at a high level in the future to support the investment required to deliver new business growth and maintain the
existing PoS park. Moreover, given its reliance on sophisticated and complex machinery, our coffee roasting
plant could necessitate significant capital expenditures to remain operational. In addition, we finance the
purchase of new equipment and PoS through lease agreements in order to lower maintenance capital
expenditures. As of June 30, 2019, we had €40.6 million outstanding under finance leases. If we are not able to
enter into these lease agreements, our cash requirements for capital expenditures would increase. As our capital
expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on different capital intensity in different business
segments, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to new business, requirements for new PoS versus
refurbished PoS, and specific initiatives to develop telemetry and cashless payment technologies, among other
factors, we can provide no assurance that our capital expenditure will not exceed our expectations. Such
increases may divert significant cash flows from other investments or uses, including debt servicing, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The loss of major customers or partners, or the inability to establish new customer relationships or_**
**_partnerships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We compete to maintain existing customers and to establish new customer relationships in our markets.
However, we can give no assurance of our ability to maintain or renew existing contracts or enter into new
contracts. For example, in 2018, we did not succeed in renewing our contract to provide OCS to a large customer
in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, in certain of our markets we are heavily dependent on our large customers,
such as RATP and SNCF in France. Our ability to compete effectively in these markets depends on our ability to
retain our large customers.

We have a number of partnerships with third parties that allow the use of our partner’s well-known brand
and product in our PoS. Two of our key partnerships for premium coffee are with Starbucks and Lavazza, which
currently span across twelve of our markets. The loss of such partnerships, or the inability to establish new
partnerships with other trendy brands in the market could have a material adverse effect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. We also have a partnership with 365 Retail Market, a self-checkout
workplace technology provider, in regards to our MicroMarkets, and a loss of this partnership could have a
material adverse effect on our MicroMarkets offering.

In addition to our private self-service retail customer contracts, we also maintain contracts with public
customers, who generally have longer terms and are awarded pursuant to public tenders in accordance with EU
and national public tenders laws. We can give no assurance that we will successfully compete in future auction
processes for public service contracts or that current public self-service retail customers will continue to welcome
our PoS on their premises. We are also subject to the risk that contracts with public customers could face legal
challenge because public tender rules were not followed. We can provide no assurance that the loss of any single
customer or group of customers would not have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our_**
**_business._**

The United Kingdom’s initiation of the process to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to Article 50
of the Treaty on European Union following the national referendum in June 2016 (“Brexit”), which is currently
scheduled to occur on October 31, 2019, has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between
the United Kingdom, one of our current markets, and the EU, including each of its member states, which may
constitute an additional risk for the financial markets and the European economy. A downturn in the European

39


-----

economy could have adverse effects on our business in every market in which it operates. In addition, since the
completion of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition, we have increased our
presence in the United Kingdom, which in turn increases our exposure to the negative outcomes of Brexit. For
the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, the United Kingdom (including Express Vending) accounted for 15% of
our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) and 12% of our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC). The most pertinent issue posed
by Brexit is possible short term delays in the importation of goods. Although our suppliers have contingency
plans in place to maintain supply and we are able to increase manufacturing and delivery of buffer stock to the
UK prior to Brexit, these measures may not be effective in the long-term. Other possible negative outcomes
resulting from Brexit include: significantly disrupted trade between the United Kingdom and the EU; political
and economic instability in other countries of the EU, which covers the majority of our markets; and instability in
the global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the euro and the pound
sterling. The depreciation of the pound sterling against the euro has caused, and may continue to cause, an
increase in the price of consumer goods in the UK that are sourced from the EU. Therefore, Brexit might also
affect our ability to maintain the current level of sales in the United Kingdom. The financial, trade and legal
implications of Brexit are unknown and there is uncertainty as to whether, and to what extent, our business might
be affected. Therefore, Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We may not be able to successfully integrate future acquired businesses into our existing business._**

We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses or technologies that have the potential
to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings. We cannot provide assurance that we
will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot
provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our existing business or
perform in line with expectations. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully
integrated with our existing business, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and
adversely affected. No assurance can be given that we will be able to fully integrate the operations of the
businesses we will acquire without encountering difficulties, which may include, among other things, the loss of
key employees, diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or
possible inconsistencies in standards, procedures and policies. In addition, we may not have, or be able to retain,
employees with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with our integration plan and could experience
employee departures and early retirement, all of which could adversely affect our integration efforts.

Additionally, integration of acquired businesses into our business is a complex, costly, and time-consuming
process, and may face unforeseen challenges. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management
attention and resources to integrate new business practices and operations with ours, with which we may not have
previous experience. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, could
restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating new
businesses and to realize any anticipated benefits of such transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of
momentum in, our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operation.

**_We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with_**
**_acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending_**
**_Acquisition)._**

We have in the past, and will continue to grow our business through acquisitions. For example, on
August 17, 2018, we completed the Express Vending Acquisition; on February 2, 2018, we completed the
Argenta Acquisition; and on September 7, 2017, we completed the Pelican Rouge Acquisition. As the integration
of these acquired businesses is ongoing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate
these businesses into our existing business. Further, in order to realize the full benefits of such acquisitions, we
have implemented certain operational efficiency and cost saving measures, as further described under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors
_Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Anticipated Cost Savings and Synergies Resulting_
_from Acquisitions.” We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefit of these measures, either in the amount_
or within the timeframe expected, and the costs of achieving such measures may be higher than expected. Our
ability to realize such operational efficiency and cost saving measures may be affected by a number of factors,
including regulations with respect to personnel and negotiations with trade unions, delays in the ability of our
suppliers to deliver certain innovations we require to implement our plans and delays due to required systems

40


-----

modifications, which may offset the cost savings expected to be realized as part of past or future acquisitions,
including from the Express Vending Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Pelican Rouge Acquisition.

Moreover, successful integration and the realization of synergies require, among other things, proper
coordination of business development and marketing efforts, retention of certain key members of management,
policies for effective recruitment and training as well as the ability to adapt information and computer systems.
Any difficulties encountered in combining operations could result in higher integration costs and lower savings
or revenues than expected. There will accordingly be uncertainty as to the extent to which anticipated synergies
from acquisitions will be achieved and the timing of their realization. Moreover, the integration of Selecta’s
existing operations with the operations of such acquired businesses (including the Pelican Rouge, Argenta and
Express Vending businesses) could interfere with the respective businesses and divert management’s attention
from other aspects of our business, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation.

In addition, our ability to realize any anticipated synergies is subject to significant business, economic and
competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, such as labor laws, changes
to government regulation governing or otherwise impacting our industry, employee strikes, changes in the
political environment in countries where we operate, obtaining appropriate approvals and licenses, operating
difficulties, consumer preferences, changes in competition and general economic or industry conditions.
Consequently, we may overestimate the cost synergies that will result from past or future acquisitions (including
the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition) or underestimate
the time or cost required to implement such synergy plans. Failure to realize the expected synergies could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Certain products we sell are susceptible to seasonal variation and sustained periods of abnormal weather can_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our vends of certain products have historically been affected by seasonal variation during the year. Many of
our PoS include cold drinks, which have historically generated increased vends during the summer months.
Coffee vends generally exhibit less variation, but can also be affected by some seasonal factors, especially for
our PoS inside offices or in other private locations, where vends are lower during public holidays. In addition,
severe weather can influence consumer traffic patterns in high-traffic areas such as gas stations, train and subway
stations and airports. If, for example, transportation services are closed due to heavy snow or rain, our PoS in
those locations may be accessible to significantly fewer consumers and vends lost on a particular business day
typically cannot be recouped in the future. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to
effectively manage the stocking of our products influenced by seasonal variation or that severe weather or other
events will not reduce our vends at certain locations, the occurrence of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are susceptible to claims of anti-competitive practices._**

Part of our overall strategy is to be a market leader in each of the markets in which we operate. For this
reason, and taking into particular consideration our leading market positions in France, Switzerland, Sweden and
the UK, we may be accused of the abuse of our position or the use of anti-competitive practices. This risk may
increase in the event we acquire companies that have market leading positions in the countries in which we
operate. Any such claims could adversely affect our reputation, potentially result in legal proceedings that could
have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and require us to divest assets in
markets where we have a dominant or leading position. Such claims could also impair our ability to conduct
acquisitions accretive to our business. Before certain future acquisitions can be consummated, we may be
required to seek approvals and consents from regulatory agencies or there may be applicable waiting periods that
will need to expire. We may be unable to obtain such regulatory approvals or consents, or, in order to obtain
them, we may be required to dispose of assets or take other actions that could have the effect of reducing our
revenue. Even if regulatory authorities do not require disposals or other actions, the regulatory approval process
triggered by our market position or claims of anti-competitive practices may have the effect of delaying
acquisitions.

For example, on July 17, 2014, the Italian Competition Authority (“ICA”) initiated proceedings against the
Argenta Group pursuant to article 14 of Law n. 287/90 to assess an allegation against Argenta Group and eight
other companies operating in the self-service retail in connection with potential unlawful market sharing. On
February 25, 2015, the ICA initiated proceedings against three additional companies and CONFIDA
Associazione Italiana Distribuzione Automatica, the association representing the main companies of the Italian

41


-----

retail industry, and extended the investigation into further allegations of anti-competitive behavior in relation to
certain private and public tenders for self-service retail services. On June 14, 2016, the ICA issued its final
decision holding the Argenta Group and all other parties to the proceeding (except for Gedac S.r.l.) had infringed
art. 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The ICA imposed on all parties fines at the
maximum possible level provided under Law n. 287/90, consisting of 10% of the overall annual turnover of a
company. The fine imposed on Argenta Group is equal to €19.7 million. On June 27, 2016, the ICA granted
Argenta Group’s request to pay the fine in 30 monthly installments of €0.7 million each beginning in August
2016 and ending in January 2019; these payments were not indemnified under the Argenta Acquisition
Agreement. On November 28, 2017, Argenta Group filed an appeal before the Italian Council of State to obtain a
reduction of the amount of the fine. All instalments of the penalty have been paid, however, the appeal for the
reduction of the total amount remains ongoing. Individuals or companies affected by the illegal conduct could
rely on the ICA decision to bring civil damages actions against Argenta Group and the other addressees of the
decision. Damages actions are subject to a limitation period of five years from cessation of the damaging
conduct. In this case, the damaging conduct could be deemed to have stopped, when the ICA opened the relevant
investigation in July 2014, and no damage action has been brought to date.

**_Our insurance is limited and subject to exclusions, and depends on the ongoing viability of our insurers; we_**
**_may also incur liabilities or losses that are not covered by insurance._**

We currently have in place various insurance policies that cover general liability, property damage and
losses due to the interruption of our business in accordance with market practice in the industry and subject to
customary conditions. Our PoS are generally insured by our customers against damage and vandalism, pursuant
to provisions of our customer contracts which require such insurance to be procured by the customer or included
as part of its general insurance policy coverage. Our other fixed assets, such as our office buildings, technical
equipment used in distribution, restocking and PoS refurbishment, information technology and office equipment
are protected by a group insurance policy (damages from fire, natural catastrophes, theft, flood and severe
weather) that includes certain related business interruption insurance.

Our insurance policies are subject to limitations and exclusions. Furthermore, we do not have insurance for
every type of interruption since such risks cannot be insured or can only be insured on inadequate or onerous
terms. For example, while we fulfil our insurer’s necessary requirements with respect to our coffee roasting
facility, our insurer has noted that the facility lacks a sprinkler system, the costs of installing which outweigh the
benefits. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our insurance programs would be sufficient to cover all
potential losses, that we will be able to obtain sufficient levels of property insurance coverage in the future or that
such coverage will be available on terms acceptable to us.

Moreover, certain types of losses, such as those resulting from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes,
environmental hazards or terrorist acts, may not be fully insurable or may be uninsurable. Moreover, the business
impact of any resulting interruptions has not been quantified and our insurance coverage may not be aligned with
management’s expectations. For example, although our coffee roasting plant is generally insured, if for any
reason our roaster is inoperable for a period of time, the losses we would suffer from the shortage of the coffee
supply are not insured, while the cost associated with replacing the roaster would be approximately €3 million.
We use our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits, deductibility provisions and the appropriateness
of self-insuring with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and on suitable
terms. If we suffer an uninsured or underinsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have
invested in a business or property as well as the anticipated future revenue from such business or property. Such
uninsured or underinsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We are exposed to credit risk related to our customers, which may cause us to make larger allowances for_**
**_doubtful trade receivables or incur write-offs related to impaired debts._**

We engage in numerous sales transactions with our customers and suppliers, and we are subject to the risk
that one or more of these counterparties becomes insolvent and therefore becomes unable to discharge their
obligations to us. Such risk may be exacerbated by our IT system’s inability to consolidate such exposures at the
group level or maintain automated credit limits in every instance, in addition to events or circumstances that are
inherently difficult to anticipate or control. If one of our counterparties were to default on its obligations or
otherwise be unable to discharge its contractual obligations, this could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operation.

42


-----

**_Our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key employees._**

We depend on certain key executives and personnel for our success. Our performance and our ability to
implement our strategies depend on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key employees. Our
operations could be adversely affected if, for any reason, a number of these officers or key employees do not
remain with us. In the event that such key personnel choose not to remain with us, there is a risk that they may
join a competing business. Furthermore, there may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to
serve in these positions, and we may be unable to replace key employees with qualified personnel on acceptable
terms. Additionally, we have, in the past been able to increase our sales capabilities through a consistent
assessment and improvement program for our sales staff, which has assisted in attracting and retaining talented
sales employees. We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our senior management team
and other key employees to execute our business plans. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain
key management and sales personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees may
experience uncertainty about their future roles, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and
retain key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key management and
sales personnel and other key employees. Our ability to recruit, motivate and retain personnel is important to our
success, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so. Loss of our key employees could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may face labor disruptions that could interfere with our operations and have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Labor law in the countries where we operate provides a high level of protection to employees. As of
June 30, 2019, we employed 10,305 FTEs under a variety of arrangements consistent with local laws and
employment practices. The countries in which we operate provide various bargaining rights, among other
protections, to employees. These employment rights may require us to expend greater time and costs in altering
or amending employees’ terms of employment or discontinuing employment relationships. Although we believe
that we have good relations with the labor unions and other such organizations that represent our labor force, we
cannot assure you that we will not experience a deterioration in our labor relations, resulting in strikes or other
disturbances occasioned by our unionized labor force. For example, labor unions may organize strikes if they
disagree with our business strategy for the Group. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that, upon the expiration of
existing collective bargaining agreements with the unions representing our labor force, we will be able to reach
new agreements on satisfactory terms or that we would agree on such new agreements without work stoppages,
strikes or similar industrial actions.

In certain instances, we consult and seek the input of our employee works councils with respect to a broad
range of matters. While we generally have been able to successfully consult with our works councils and we
regard our relations with our executives, employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory,
negotiations may be challenging in connection with the integration process of the Group, as we seek to achieve
competitive cost structures in each market in which we operate while meeting the compensation and benefits
needs of our executives and employees. Consultations with works councils, strikes, similar industrial actions or
other disturbances by our workforce could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of reputation, increased wages
and benefits or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

There can be no assurance that there will not be labor disputes or adverse employee relations in the future.
Disruptions of business operations due to strikes or similar measures by our employees or the employees of any
of our significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_Restrictions to the immigration of workers from EU countries to Switzerland could impede our ability to hire_**
**_or retain employees in Switzerland and limit our ability to conduct our business._**

For our Swiss operations, we rely on certain employees who have immigrated to Switzerland. In the past,
Swiss voters have approved at least one federal ballot measure that sought to restrict immigration, including for
work purposes and a further popular initiative has been launched recently that seeks to terminate Switzerland’s
bilateral agreement with the European Union and its member states on the free movement of people. As of the
date of this Offering Memorandum, the impact of this popular initiative on us and our workforce is unclear.

To the extent that the free movement of people will be restricted as a result of approved popular initiatives
or otherwise, our ability to hire and retain high-skilled and low-skilled employees could be impeded.

43


-----

Furthermore, a termination of the bilateral agreement on the free movement of people or unilateral restrictions to
that effect could limit our access to the European single market and, thus, adversely affect our ability to compete
within the European Union. For example, further restrictions on trade or the need to acquire additional
certifications for our products or services could limit our ability to conduct our business and increase our costs of
doing business. We may also be limited in or prohibited from competing for business with customers that rely on
public procurements funds within the European Union. Any of the above occurrences, alone or in combination,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings in the normal course of our business_**
**_and otherwise._**

We are subject to the risk of legal claims and proceedings and regulatory enforcement actions in the
ordinary course of our business and otherwise. From time to time, we have been party as defendant or plaintiff to
various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our business, such as those related to
employment matters, deductibility of interest and VAT payments and refunds, among others. For example, the
Dutch tax authorities have challenged the deductibility of interest expenses on certain shareholder loans of
Pelican Rouge B.V. for the financial years 2011 through 2014, and concluded that interest on these shareholder
loans is not deductible. This conclusion has resulted in additional tax assessments of approximately €22 million.
We appealed this decision in 2016 and are awaiting a judgement from the court. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we have not made any payment to the tax authorities. In connection with this claim, the purchase
price for the acquisition of Pelican Rouge was reduced. In addition, we issued contingent value notes in favor of
the previous owners of Pelican Rouge B.V. which are payable in the event that the final tax assessment due and
payable is less than the amount of the purchase price reduction, in which case an amount representing the
difference between the purchase price reduction and the final tax assessment is payable to the previous owners of
Pelican Rouge B.V. The results of pending or future legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, and we
can provide no assurance that we will not incur losses in connection with current or future legal or regulatory
proceedings (including tax audits) or actions that exceed any provision we may set aside in respect of such
proceedings or actions or that exceed any insurance coverage available, which may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial position and results of operations. See “Business—Legal, Arbitral and Administrative
_Proceedings” for further information with respect to our current legal proceedings._

**_Our indemnification rights under the acquisition agreements we have entered into are limited._**

Pursuant to the acquisition agreements entered into in connection with the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the
Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition, subject to vendor indemnities secured in these
transactions, we are generally subject to all of the liabilities of the acquired business arising in connection with
operations prior to the closing date of the relevant acquisition. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or
did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence. Under each of the respective acquisition
agreements, we have been provided with a limited set of warranties and indemnities in relation to identified risks.
Our sole remedy from the sellers for any breach of those warranties is an action for indemnification, which is
subject to certain negotiated limitations and thresholds, or an action for damages. Our rights to indemnification in
most cases must be asserted within a negotiated time period after closing, which means if we fail to identify a
breach promptly after closing, we may not be able to recover amounts to which we otherwise would have been
entitled. We have secured insurance to cover losses arising in respect of the breach by the seller of those
warranties and funds have been placed into escrow, but such funds may prove insufficient to cover damages that
may occur. Damages resulting from a breach of warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We incur post-retirement costs, including under defined benefit pension plans, and funding these costs could_**
**_adversely affect our financial condition._**

The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit plans which are funded by the Group, the
employees, and in certain countries, by state authorities. We have pension plans in various countries, with the
majority of our pension liabilities deriving from the UK and Switzerland. For example, in Switzerland, we
maintain a pension scheme in accordance with Swiss pension law. The Swiss pension scheme requires
contributions to be made at defined rates. However, the pension scheme incorporates certain guarantees of
minimum interest accumulation and conversion of capital to pension. As a result, the pension scheme has been
reported as a defined benefit pension plan in accordance with IFRS and can lead to the Group making additional
contributions.

44


-----

For the financial years ended September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, our costs incurred in connection with
post-retirement were €6.4 million, €4.6 million and €4.7 million, respectively, and such expenses may increase in
the future and materially affect our financial results, financial condition or cash flows. As of September 30, 2016,
our defined benefit pension plans were under-funded by €23.5 million. As of September 30, 2017 and 2018, our
defined benefit pension plans were over-funded by €22.7 million and €42.1 million, respectively. Declines in
global capital markets affecting our expected rate of return on pension assets and discount rates may cause
reductions in the value of our pension plan assets and estimates of benefit obligations. Such circumstances could
also have an adverse effect on future pension expense and funding requirements. In addition, the accounting
standards and legal conditions governing our pension obligations are subject to changes in applicable policy,
legislation or case law, which may also lead to new or more extensive pension obligations or may impact our
previous pension obligation calculations. Any of these factors or developments could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Increases in the minimum wage or labor and employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our labor and employment costs may rise in the future, or rise faster than expected as a result of minimum
wage increases, increased workforce activism, government decrees, and changes in social and pension
contribution rules meant to reduce government budget deficits or to increase welfare benefits to employees. We
may not be able to offset increases in labor and employment costs through productivity gains. For example,
changes to the National Living Wage and an increase in the National Minimum Wage in the UK in recent years
have increased our UK payroll costs. See “—Changes in governmental regulations and legislation may subject us
_to new and onerous obligations.” If the minimum wage in some of the countries in which we operate increases,_
or if labor and employment costs increase in the future, our operating costs will increase, which could, if we
cannot recover these costs from our customers or consumers through increased selling prices or offset them
through productivity gains or other measures, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may not realize the full value thereof._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. As of June 30, 2019, our goodwill, which represents the
excess of the cost of acquisitions over our interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities recognized, amounted to €1,053.4 million, representing 40% of our total assets of
€2,633.4 million. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any indication of
impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in
expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, and a variety of other factors. The amount of any
impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to our income statement. Any future impairment of
goodwill may result in material reductions of our income and equity under IFRS.

**_The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information presented in this Offering Memorandum may_**
**_not reflect what our actual results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented and thus_**
**_these results may not be indicative of our future operating performance. The Unaudited Non-GAAP_**
**_Aggregated Financial Information included herein are subject to certain significant assumptions and_**
**_limitations._**

In order to aid the comparability of the financial condition and results of operations of our entire business
undertaking, we have presented the Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information, which gives effect
to various perimeter adjustments, including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition, and the
Express Vending Acquisition, and constant currency adjustments. See “Summary—Summary Historical
_Financial and Other Information—Summary Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information” and_
“Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information.”

The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with
IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial
Information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent our actual financial position
or results. The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information is based on certain assumptions that we
believe are reasonable. Our assumptions may prove to be inaccurate over time. Accordingly, the Unaudited
Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information may not reflect what our results of operations and financial
condition would have been had we been a consolidated company during the periods presented, or what our
results of operations and financial condition will be in the future. The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated

-----

Financial Information should be considered in addition to, and not instead of, our Historical Financial
Statements, and have not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities
Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or any other regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, or any other
regulator. They are not, and do not purport to be, pro forma financial data that has been prepared, audited, or
reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted accounting or auditing standards, and they should not be
read as such.

The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information includes the results of operations and
financial condition of Selecta, the Pelican Rouge Group, the Argenta Group and the Express Vending Group for
each of the periods presented even though we may not have owned or controlled such businesses for all or any of
the duration of the periods presented and would not have been permitted under IFRS to consolidate the results of
such businesses in any historical financial statements. As we have acquired the Pelican Rouge Group, the
Argenta Group, and the Express Vending Group we aggregate 100% of their revenue and expenses in the
Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information for each of the periods presented, despite the fact that
we did not control them, as applicable. For more information on the presentation of financial information in this
Offering Memorandum, including their limitations, please see “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information.”_

In addition, we have presented certain key operating metrics at the level of the Group even though we may
not have owned or controlled certain businesses or entities for the entire duration of the periods presented.

Our lack of operating history as a consolidated company and the challenge of integrating previously
independent businesses make evaluating our business and future financial prospects difficult. Our potential for
future business success and operating profitability must be considered in light of the risks, uncertainties,
expenses and difficulties typically encountered by recently organized or combined companies.

**_The interests of our principal shareholder may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholder, KKR, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests
as holders of the Additional Notes (the “Holders”). Our principal shareholder has, and will continue to have,
directly or indirectly, the ability, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day
operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve any other changes to our
operations. For example, our principal shareholder could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell
certain material assets or make dividends distributions, in each case, so long as the Indenture, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness
would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate
revenue, each of which could adversely affect the Holders.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to the Group’s tax position could adversely affect the Group’s results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

The Group is subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws or enforcement thereof could adversely
affect the Group’s tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. The Group often relies on
generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the
relevant tax authorities are in agreement with the Group’s interpretation of these laws. If the Group’s tax
positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require the Group to
pay taxes that the Group currently does not collect or pay or increase the costs of the Group’s services to track
and collect such taxes, which could increase the Group’s costs of operations or the Group’s effective tax rate and
have a negative effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of
any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition
and results of operations.

In particular, we face the risk of challenges to the tax deductibility of interest on intercompany loans. We
are at present and have been in the past subject to tax audits addressing tax deductibility of interest. While we
endeavor to comply with all such tax regulations, changes in tax law or enforcement may result in the
requirement to pay additional taxes or penalties.

**_Italian withholding taxes or deduction may be payable on amounts paid by Italian Guarantors._**

Under a certain interpretation, payments made by an Italian resident Guarantor to non-resident persons
without an Italian permanent establishment to which the Notes are effectively connected may be subject to Italian

46


-----

withholding taxes or deduction of taxes. The possible imposition of withholding taxes or deduction of taxes with
respect to payments on the Notes and the resulting obligation to pay additional amounts to noteholders could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the Notes and the_**
**_Guarantees._**

After completion of the Offering, we will be highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations.
As of June 30, 2019, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering, we would have had total financial
indebtedness in the amount of €1,465.1 million (euro equivalent) (excluding financial leases, factoring and other
local facilities), consisting entirely of the Notes. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for
the foreseeable future. See “Capitalization,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Offering could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the Revolving Credit
Facility and other debt and liabilities we may incur;

   - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

   - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

   - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

   - increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate
of interest;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;
and

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any
future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our obligations, including under the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on_**
**_cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to make payments on the Notes and the_**
**_Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no business operations other than management of the equity interests
it holds in its subsidiaries. The Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form
of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes
and the Guarantees. Given the Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries
and business participations, which individually contribute to our results. The amounts of dividends and
distributions available to the Issuer depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of
each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law. The Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not
be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the
Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the Notes and the Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of
these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such

47


-----

payments to further taxation. Applicable laws may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be
permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In
particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the
amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay its debt when due. The
subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect
to the Notes or the Guarantees.

While the Indenture limits the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. We have the ability
to borrow up to €150.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is secured by the Collateral, and the
Indenture also permits the incurrence of additional debt thereunder. As of June 30, 2019, €106.9 million was
drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, which we intend to repay in full using a portion of the proceeds from
the Offering. See “Use of Proceeds.” The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permit us
to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes and to incur
indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the
Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent
that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes or secure the Notes, and other debt could be secured or could
mature prior to the Notes. Although the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred
in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Issuer’s and its
subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and
the Guarantees.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture contain covenants which impose significant
operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

   - pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;

   - make certain restricted payments and investments;

   - transfer or sell assets;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;

   - merge or consolidate with other entities, or make certain asset sales; and

   - impair the security interests in the Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain
circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while
amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description

48


-----

_of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the_
Revolving Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will
meet such financial ratio. Subject to certain agreed cure rights, a failure to comply with the financial ratio, if
tested, will result in a draw stop in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility. A breach of any of the covenants or
restrictions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could result in an event of default under this
agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with respect
to any other event of default by the creditors under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the relevant
creditors could cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and elect to declare all amounts
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In
addition, a default under the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under
other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our
creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts,
we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those
amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to
enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed
against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Revolving
Credit Facility and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will
depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success
of our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and
other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit
Facility. At the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility, which matures six months before the Notes, the Notes
or any other debt that we may incur, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we do not
have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our
other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Notes, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, limit, and any future debt may limit, our
ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position
and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could
be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be
acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our
obligations.

-----

**_Drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, debt incurred under the Floating Rate Notes, and any other_**
**_variable interest rate debt we incur in the future will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly,_**
**_thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in
interest rates, primarily under the Floating Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, which is based on the
Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an
applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense
associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures. Neither our Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our
floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these
rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to
terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense
would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law
enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into
whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR may have been
manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or
other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and
international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market
Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force
on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of
benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could
be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27,
2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit
rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA
Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at the FCA on
January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be
guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. The potential elimination of the
LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or
actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is
determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in
respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the
cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse
impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_Hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties_**
**_fall into bankruptcy._**

We may enter into interest hedging agreements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates,
primarily under the Revolving Credit Facility. We may also enter currency hedging arrangements in respect of
the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. Under any such agreements, we would be exposed to credit risks of
our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap
agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our
debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which
would result in a loss.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce_**
**_the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Notes allow the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral
providers to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose
of any income from the Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has
occurred and subject to certain conditions, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other Collateral providers may,

50


-----

among other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the
Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future_**
**_indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement_**
**_ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the_**
**_enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the
Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,
including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned over amounts and other
recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations
(including, among others, those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future
indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying
any such amounts toward discharging the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may
not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater
than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all
obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the
Notes and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will
have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the
holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the
value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees thereof are secured on a first ranking basis with security
interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities and to certain
hedging counterparties. The Indenture also permits the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance
with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates
the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action
unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the
senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit
**Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time**
(the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor
representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or
instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then creditors holding more than 50% of
the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total topco credit
participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless
instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or
(ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the
“Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions
received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the
Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions
first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or
(ii) if Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions
first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then
the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may at any time provide immediate
enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior

51


-----

Secured Creditors determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or
the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with respect to
the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with the first such notice of
such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that
they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event
which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the
Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any
requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the
Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions until it has been
indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction that it may in its discretion require for any cost, loss or liability
which it may incur in complying with those instructions.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the
voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of
indebtedness we incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes
to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of any of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under
the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be
released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these
restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes have limited remedies and recourse against the
Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement.”_

**_The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as security for the_**
**_Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that do not secure the Notes._**

The Notes are secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—
_Security.” Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries_
to secure any future Indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Indenture
(which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted
subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event
of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Guarantees thereof will
not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured
indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the
Collateral securing the Notes.

While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security
over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or
subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Agreed Security
Principles set forth in the Indenture set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be
granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may
result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not
being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the
value of the security or guarantees provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes_**
**_and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets
underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Notes. In the event of an enforcement of the
security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. The Collateral provided as
security for the Notes is limited to liens granted by Guarantors over the shares in other Guarantors and over
intercompany structural loans granted to Guarantors whose shares have been so pledged and to liens over
material bank accounts of the Issuer. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Trade receivables, inventories,
intellectual property rights, real property or other assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not
constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this
Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among
other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such
sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are
located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may
provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its
value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will
be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of
foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of
investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the
Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain
jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged.
Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result,
enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may
be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the
Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to
any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have
limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares
that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be
satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge
of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition,
the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all
amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the
Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
remaining assets.

The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes
on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including
statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties
may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds
available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. In particular, security interests in the Collateral may be
released if a lien is granted on such Collateral in favor of other indebtedness so long as such lien is a Permitted
Lien (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”). Moreover, if we issue
additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same collateral as
the holders of the Notes, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Additional Notes,_**
**_or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such_**
**_security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantees and security interests to secure the Additional Notes may create hardening or
voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared
security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in
particular, as the Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain
circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance
period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or
perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the

53


-----

respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective
and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Additional Notes in connection with the accession
of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant assets and
equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Additional Notes or under the Guarantees thereof or the Collateral_**
**_across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands; the Guarantors are incorporated or organized
under the laws of Belgium, England and Wales, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland;
the Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of those jurisdictions,
and certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries in
respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a
similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Additional Notes,
the guarantees, the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several
jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such
complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Collateral may limit the
realizable value of the Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any
conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular
jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the guarantees and the
security documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_**
**_of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security
Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any
of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except
through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed
to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Existing Notes have and the
holders of the Additional Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example,
the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale
through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of
certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as
registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document are validly secured and/or can be enforced;
this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other
jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security
interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the
relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to
holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All or
part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as
security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same
time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such

54


-----

security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under
law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the
Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties,
holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the
Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the
security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Any failure
to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee
in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. The Trustee and the
Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure
the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent_**
**_obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including
a sale or other disposition of such Collateral in a transaction that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the
Indenture, as applicable, and in connection with an enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Indenture also permits us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as
unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture,
all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary
will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as
such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares
of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

**_The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as_**
**_the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may_**
**_adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date, our obligations under the Additional Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant
Guarantors and secured by security interests over the relevant Collateral. The Issuer is incorporated under the
laws of the Netherlands and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under the laws of Belgium, England
and Wales, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. There is a rebuttable presumption that
the “centre of main interest” as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In
addition, the Collateral includes a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the
laws of Belgium, England and Wales, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and pledges
of certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of Belgium, England and Wales, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and
Switzerland.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer,
the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in
such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee

55


-----

against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral (the “Security Interests”). In
certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Guarantee if the company is close to or
near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an
overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s
fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as
preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other
grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security
Interests provided by such security provider;

   - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any
Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the
Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a
preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot
assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of
each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the Security Interests is limited to the amount that will
result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers
under the Security Documents is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court
would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the
entire Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See
also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would,
for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the
Guarantor or security provider:

   - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created
such security after its insolvency;

   - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person
as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such
Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or Security Interest
knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for
insolvency had been made; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or
Security Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and
only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was
insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the
Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to
engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were
unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to
make required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally
may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security
Interest if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

   - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

56


-----

   - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering, there can be no
assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was
“insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of
the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that
date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was
insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of
the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and
Security Interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and_**
**_the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral._**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under the laws of Belgium, England and Wales,
France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee
against, or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor is subject to certain defenses available
to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or
similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, by limiting the amounts
recoverable under the Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder are
limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider
under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is
not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or
Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral
would be in breach of capital maintenance, financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules
or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider
to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Transfer of the Additional Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Additional_**
**_Notes._**

Because the Additional Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not required to be,
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered
or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These
restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Additional Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the
Additional Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Additional Notes in the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_The Additional Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Additional Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined below) will trade in book entry form only, and Additional Notes in
definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below), will be issued in exchange for book
entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book entry interests will not be considered owners
or holders of Additional Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be
the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Additional Notes. Payments of principal, interest
and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the Additional Notes will be made to
the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be
credited to participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Additional
Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for

57


-----

Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent
will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of
book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on
the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a
holder of the Additional Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Additional Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the
direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders
of the Additional Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the
extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented
for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes representing the Additional Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors
own book entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to
be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights
under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Additional Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Additional Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market in the Additional Notes;

   - your ability to sell your Additional Notes; or

   - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Additional Notes.

Future trading prices of the Additional Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading
market for the Additional Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar
securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Additional Notes. Any such disruption may
have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Additional Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes after
completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to limitations
imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. In addition, if the Additional Notes
are issued with 1.0 percentage point or more of original issue discount they will not be fungible with the Existing
Notes, resulting in a less liquid trading market for such Additional Notes. As a result, there may not be an active
market for the Additional Notes. If no active trading market is maintained, you may not be able to resell your
Additional Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors, including depositors,_**
**_trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of
non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such
subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors
of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer
becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a
solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to
proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and

   - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the
assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as
applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

58


-----

As such, the Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the creditors, including depositors,
trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer. In
addition, the Indenture, subject to certain limitations, permits these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur
substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indenture, and such
indebtedness may also be secured. The Indenture does not contain any limitation on the amount of other
liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized or incorporated outside the United States, and their business is
substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the
Guarantors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States.
Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the
United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, as substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive
officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained
in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the
Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce
(i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer, the Guarantors and the directors and executive
officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions
against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the Netherlands. For further
information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes, including the Additional Notes, upon a change of control._**
**_In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes,_**
**_including the Additional Notes, in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the_**
**_tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to
purchase all the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a
situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer.
If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the
tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A
change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and
agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any
failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the
Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations
or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not
involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control
as defined in the Indenture.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net
leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in
such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all
of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right
to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to
the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, the Issuer will
be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of “change of control”
in the Indenture includes (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole), to any person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law,
varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may
be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes.

**_The Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act (the “Regulation S Additional_**
**_Notes”) will be initially issued with a temporary ISIN and common code. In the event that we are unable to_**
**_transfer the Regulation S Additional Notes to the permanent ISIN and common code, the Regulation S_**
**_Additional Notes will continue to trade under an ISIN and common code different from the ISIN and common_**
**_code of the applicable Existing Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act (the “Regulation S_**
**_Existing Notes”), which may adversely affect the liquidity of the Regulation S Additional Notes and cause the_**
**_Regulation S Additional Notes to trade at different prices than the Regulation S Existing Notes._**

Once the Regulation S Additional Notes offered hereby have become freely tradeable upon the expiration of
the restrictive period under Regulation S, we expect that the Additional Notes will share a single ISIN and
common code with the Regulation S Existing Notes and the Regulation S Additional Notes and the Regulation S
Existing Notes will thereafter be fungible. However, in the event that we are unable to transfer the Regulation S
Additional Notes to the permanent ISIN and common code, the Regulation S Additional Notes will continue to
trade under separate ISIN and common codes to the Regulation S Existing Notes, which may adversely affect the
liquidity of the Regulation S Additional Notes and cause the Regulation S Additional Notes to trade at different
prices than the Regulation S Existing Notes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of proceeds from the issuance of the
Additional Notes based on our balance sheet data as of June 30, 2019 (with the modifications described below)
assuming that the Additional Notes are issued at par. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts
depending on several factors, including the actual price of the Additional Notes, accrued interest on debt being
repaid, and differences from our estimated fees and expenses associated with the Offering.

proceeds from the Offering would be used to replenish such cash on hand.

(3) Represents excess cash funded to the balance sheet of the Issuer for general corporate purposes.

(4) Includes estimated fees and expenses in connection with the Refinancing, including placement, advisory, and other transaction costs and
professional fees. To the extent the Additional Notes are issued with original issue discount, this amount will increase. This amount may

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be_
_read in conjunction with the Selecta Financial Statements which were prepared in accordance with IFRS, as well_
_as with “Selected Historical Financial Data,” and “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” included_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. For purposes of this section, all references to “Selecta,” “we,” “us,”_
_“our” or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information are to Selecta Group B.V. and its_
_subsidiaries on a consolidated basis._

_The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements which, although based on_
_assumptions that we consider reasonable, are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual_
_results or conditions to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. For_
_a discussion of risks and uncertainties facing us as a result of various factors, see “Forward-Looking_
_Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

_The following discussion of our results of operations also makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial_
_measures. Prospective investors should bear in mind that these Non-GAAP Measures are not financial measures_
_defined in accordance with IFRS, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies,_
_have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of_
_our operating results as reported under IFRS. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—_
_Non-GAAP Financial Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”_

**Overview**

We are the leading route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider in Europe by
revenue with more than 475,000 PoS in 16 countries as of June 30, 2019, covering approximately 95% of
European GDP and approximately 78% of the European population. We held the number one or number two
market position based on revenue in 2017 in our ten core markets of Belgium, France, Finland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We served over ten million
consumers per day via more than 3,800 routes as of June 30, 2019. We operate in a highly fragmented market,
which provides growth opportunities, both organically and through accretive acquisitions. For the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019, we generated a revenue of €1,580.8 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €267.7 million,
and we would have generated an Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,604.7 million and an Adjusted EBITDA
(CS & CC) of €271.2 million, achieving 3.8% Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth compared to the twelve
months ended June 30, 2018, and 18.9% Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margins.

**Our Segments and Business Channels**

**_Geographic Segments_**

We report our revenue and certain other financial data by geographic segment. The geographic segments in
which we operate correspond to our reporting segments under IFRS and consist of the following for the year
ended September 30, 2018, and the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and 2019:

   - _South, UK & Ireland includes operating entities in Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK;_

   - _Central includes operating entities in Austria, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland; and_

   - _North includes operating entities in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,_
Norway, and Sweden. As of October 1, 2017, one operating entity in Finland was classified as held for
sale and excluded from this segment; it was subsequently sold in March 2018.

In addition to the segments identified above, we report separately on our Headquarters (HQ), which includes
corporate center functions in Switzerland and certain functions of former Pelican Rouge entities in the
Netherlands and in the UK.

For comparative purposes, we also presented our revenue and certain other financial data for the year ended
September 30, 2017, in line with the above geographic segments in our 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements.

For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, we reported our revenue by the following geographic
segments:

   - _France included operating entities in France;_

   - _West included operating entities in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK;_

65


-----

   - _Central included operating entities in Austria, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland; and_

   - _North included operating entities in Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and_
Sweden. As of October 1, 2016, operating entities in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were classified as
held for sale and excluded from this segment; they were subsequently sold in March 2017.

In addition to the segments identified above, we reported separately on our Headquarters (HQ), which
included corporate center functions in Switzerland.

**_Business Channels_**

We also report our revenue and certain other financial data by business channel. Our business channels
consist of the following for the year ended September 30, 2018, and the nine months ended June 30, 2018 and
2019:

   - The workplace channel, which includes revenue from (i) private self-service retail, consisting of PoS
placed and serviced in various private locations, such as large corporate customers, in various
businesses and industries and including in corporate offices, manufacturing and logistics sites, and
(ii) OCS, which is comprised of table-top coffee machines rented out to corporate customers (mainly
small and medium-sized enterprises) for office use along with the provision of technical services and
coffee and related supplies for the PoS;

   - The on-the-go channel, which includes revenue from PoS placed and serviced in semi-public areas,
such as hospitals, universities and entertainment venues, or public areas, such as train stations, airports
and gas stations, following a successful bidding process with relevant government authorities to place
our PoS in a given location; and

   - The trading channel, which includes revenue from sales of machines and products, including coffee
roasted in our roasting facility and the provision of technical and hygienic support to customers.

We did not report our revenue by the above business channels in our financial statements for prior periods,
including for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2017. However, for comparative purposes, we presented
our revenue for the year ended September 30, 2017, by business channels in our 2018 Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Our results of operation are affected by a combination of factors, including factors which are beyond our
control. We believe that our results of operations, and particularly the results of operation during the periods
under review, have been primarily affected by the following factors.

**_General Economic Conditions, Consumer Spending and Consumer Preferences_**

Demand for our PoS and products is affected by general economic conditions and consumer spending.
Changes in general economic conditions directly impact consumer spending as well as the investment levels of
our customers in non-essential services, such as PoS and services. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019,
we derived 47.0% of our revenue from workplace points of sale, which include OCS. As PoS in such privately
placed points of sale are generally located on companies’ premises in office environments and similar locations,
macroeconomic factors such as GDP and employment levels, among others, affect the number of items sold
through these PoS. For example, reductions in workforce numbers or hours worked during times of economic
downturn (including the effects of reduced overtime, layoffs and increased reliance on part-time versus full-time
workers) means that our PoS on companies’ premises and in office environments are available to fewer
consumers or consumers with lower purchasing power due to reduced income or more conservative spending
habits. On the other hand, economic growth may have a positive impact on our ability to generate new business if
companies invest in non-essential services, such as the decision to contract for the placement of a PoS on their
premises. Variations in consumer spending or consumer purchasing power can also affect revenue generated
from our PoS in public locations, but macroeconomic conditions generally have less impact on our public selfservice retail operations compared to our private operations.

In addition, our revenues in any given period are affected by our ability to maintain the appeal of our PoS to
existing consumers and attract new consumers, which depends on continuous development and improvement of
our range of products and services offering that are responsive to evolving trends and consumer preferences. For
instance, our increasing focus on premium coffee brands and the introduction of touchscreen technology and

66


-----

cashless payment options for our PoS, including our mobile phone app, Selecta eWallet, are driven by changing
consumer behaviors. Specific factors affecting consumer spending in our PoS include our ability to maintain and
improve an attractive product assortment, including through partnerships with Starbucks and Lavazza, the
location and overall aesthetic appeal of our PoS, the accessibility and integration of our on-the-go PoS channels,
and our ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing consumer demands and preferences.

**_Seasonality and Weather_**

Our vends of certain products have historically been affected by seasonal variation during the year. Many of
our PoS include cold drinks, which have historically generated increased sales during the summer months. Coffee
sales generally exhibit less variation, but may also be affected by seasonal factors, especially for our PoS inside
offices or in other private locations, where sales are lower during holiday seasons. In addition, severe weather
can influence consumer traffic patterns in high-traffic areas such as gas stations, train and subway stations, and
airports. If, for example, transportation services are closed due to heavy snow or rain, our PoS in such locations
may be accessible by significantly fewer consumers and vends lost on a particular business day typically cannot
be recouped in the future.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

We incur capital expenditures in connection with the purchase of new PoS and the refurbishment of existing
PoS in the ordinary course of business. We own approximately 78% of the PoS that we service, which we fund
through cash on balance sheet or finance leases, with the remaining PoS being owned or leased directly by our
customers. In addition, we incur capital expenditures in connection with the development of new technologies for
the retail industry, such as the ability to transmit sales and stock data remotely. We divide our capital
expenditures into gross capital expenditures, net capital expenditures, and cash capital expenditures. Gross
capital expenditures consist of self-service retail equipment purchased; net capital expenditures consist of gross
capital expenditures less the book value of total disposals of self-service retail equipment (which includes old
PoS sold); and cash capital expenditures consist of net capital expenditures net of self-service retail equipment
bought through finance lease arrangements during the same period. Capital expenditures excludes purchase of
PoS where alternative arrangements are made through third parties, such as Lavazza, to finance PoS investments.

We have launched a capital intensity program in order to reduce our total cash capital expenditure. A part of
our capital intensity program is to focus on refurbishing our PoS rather than purchasing new PoS, with a view of
expanding the life cycle of our PoS from 6 to 18 years, which in turn decreases the number of new PoS required
to maintain our PoS park. As part of this capital intensity program, we have also established two PoS upgrade
centers in Madrid and Milan.

**_Customers_**

We believe that we have stable relationships with our customers, many of whom are longstanding
customers. For example, the average length of our top ten customer contracts is over 15 years. In addition, our
customer base is highly fragmented, which limits our dependence on any single customer. For the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019, our top ten customers accounted for 9.0% of our revenue and our largest customer by
revenue accounted for 1.5% of our revenue. Nevertheless, the gain or loss of significant customers or a large
number of customers in the same period would affect our results of operations.

We manage our customer relationships differently depending on the market segment. With our workplace
customers, our contractual relationships have a shorter duration, typically between three and five years, but such
contracts often renew automatically. Customers in our on-the-go business channel (like train stations, gas
stations, public institutions and hospitals) will typically organize periodic tenders for the assignment of multiyear contracts, sometimes lasting five to over ten years. Larger customers will also generally charge us a vending
fee to place our PoS on their premises. Vending fees are negotiated according to formulas related to past or
expected traffic in the relevant location and number of vends; vending fees can be either variable (based on total
sales from the applicable PoS) or fixed (based on the number of PoS installed pursuant to the relevant contract).
Our considerable experience in the self-service retail industry provides us with extensive datasets that we can use
to calculate acceptable vending fees that will allow us to submit competitive bids on commercially viable pricing
terms.

**_PoS Density, Concept and Product Mix_**

Our results of operations and profit before interest and income tax are affected by a combination of factors,
including the number of PoS in a given area, the type of PoS, the product mix in our PoS and the level of services

-----

we provide. In both workplace and on-the-go channels, PoS density is one of the primary drivers of profitability
and a key strategy in our acquisition program. PoS that are closer together can be more quickly and efficiently
managed by the same personnel, which reduces transport time and the relative costs associated with labor,
restocking, fuel, and maintenance. In contrast, single PoS in isolated locations may not generate sufficient gross
profit to cover the costs of visits to clean, restock, or perform scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.

Our revenue and margins are also driven by our mix of workplace and on-the-go services. Because the
margins on our products may vary, changes in the mix of our product sales have a direct impact on our total
revenue and profitability. Workplace self-service retail is our largest self-service concept by revenue and is
primarily driven by sales of coffee and other hot beverages. Workplace self-service retail margins vary based on
the type of PoS located in a particular area as well as the extent to which a customer agrees to subsidize the cost
of products for its employees, or alternatively wants to receive a vending fee on it. Consumers generally consume
more products and beverages when the cost is subsidized by their employers, leading to larger volumes of vends
and higher margins. On-the-go self-service retail margins vary primarily based on the combination of the volume
of vends and the price points for the products sold, which depend on the locations of the PoS and the number of
other locations in close proximity to our PoS that sell the same or similar products, as well as the level of vending
fee paid to the customer. Our partnerships with premium coffee brands such as Starbucks and Lavazza also
provide us with the platform to offer a compelling product mix. Therefore, the combination of location, PoS
density, product mix, prices and contributions paid to the customer are among the key factors which determine
profitability of our PoS.

**_Prices of Self-service Retail Stock and Procurement Initiatives_**

Prices of certain commodities, such as green bean coffee, cocoa and sugar, affect our cost of materials. For
example, for our own coffee brands, we estimate we require approximately 7,400 tons of arabica green bean
coffee and approximately 4,100 tons of robusta green bean coffee annually to regularly stock our hot drinks selfservice PoS or supply our customers with coffee beans. Overall, we purchase more than 20,000 tons of green
bean coffee annually for our Pelican Rouge and Miofino brands, half of which we sell to third parties. Prices for
green bean coffee have fluctuated significantly in recent years. For example, the price of arabica green bean
coffee increased considerably from November 2013 to April 2014 and, alternatively, prices ranged from
U.S.$2.30 per pound in October 2011 to U.S.$1.09 per pound in October 2018 (based on the ICE ‘C’ New York
index). In order to manage risks from fluctuations in commodities prices, we secure the green bean requirements
for periods of up to twelve months by instructing the relevant supplier to source the required green beans to cover
certain production lots at a specific price. With certain strategic suppliers, we enter into longer-term agreements
with agreed price adjustment mechanisms that reflect developments in commodity prices. For our other
ingredients such as milk powders, cocoa, and sugar, we have quarterly price contracts with our suppliers ranging
between six to twelve months.

Following the completion of the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge and Argenta, we have strengthened our
corporate procurement department to leverage our scale and obtain better prices. We have started to harmonize
prices of products we purchase for our PoS (such as snacks or cold drinks), which are traditionally sourced at the
country level, by leveraging our scale and negotiating prices with large suppliers (such as Coca-Cola) through
strategic relationships at the Group level. While certain products, such as confectionary items and other stock
items that cater to local or regional tastes, continue to be sourced on a country level, we source our own brand
green bean coffee as well as cups, sugar, and stirrers, among other supplies, through our corporate procurement
department, which allows us to secure more competitive pricing based on larger volume orders.

**_Operations and Maintenance of Our Roasting Facility_**

We operate a roasting facility in Dordrecht, Netherlands, with an annual capacity of approximately 27,000
metric tons from which we supply the Group and third parties with coffee. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2019, our roasting operations accounted for 4% of our revenue. We sell coffee to businesses, such as restaurants,
coffee shops and self-service retail operators, and, in limited quantities, directly to consumers. Our roasting
operations have primarily focused on the roasting, blending, packaging and sale of our own coffee brands,
Pelican Rouge and Miofino. The results of our roasting operations are primarily affected by the level of
marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry, our ability to retain
existing customers and attract new customers for our coffee and fluctuations in the selling prices of Pelican
Rouge-branded coffee. In addition, investments required to maintain or repair our roasting facility have a
material impact on our capital expenditures.

**_Anticipated Cost Savings and Synergies Resulting from Acquisitions_**

To evaluate cost savings and synergies that we have realized and expect to achieve as a result of the Pelican
Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition we have worked with consultants and advisors, including
experienced industry professionals, to examine the profile of our combined businesses and operations. The
synergies resulting from these acquisitions primarily fall into three categories: (i) logistics and footprint
optimizations, (ii) consolidation of procurement, and (iii) selling, general, and administrative costs across the
entire organization. The integration process requires changes to our purchasing practices to improve margins,
while also implementing our own systems and best practices and adjusting our combined organizational structure
and management footprint to maximize synergies. In order to supervise this integration process, we have created
an integration office at the group level led by a dedicated project manager with extensive experience in
integrations and operational turnaround reporting to the Executive Chairman of the Group and supported by our
senior management team and dedicated specialists. We expect to realize approximately €75 million of estimated
annualized run-rate cost synergies from the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition by the end of
2020. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have realized approximately €52 million
of these cost synergies, which represents 69% of our total expected cost synergies. See “Summary—Summary
_Historical Financial and Other Information—Historical Consolidated Financial Information—Other Financial_
_Data and Operating Information” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to_
_realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with acquisitions (including the_
_Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition).” See also “Forward-_
_Looking Statements.”_

Our total estimated cost synergies described above include the following:

   - Operating cost savings relating to logistics and footprint optimizations of approximately €33 million, of
which we had realized €18 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized by
(i) combining operations in areas with fewer PoS to reduce the number of employees required to
maintain and refill these PoS, (ii) implementing Selecta’s refiller planning program, which is based on
actual sales of each PoS rather than a theoretical model, (iii) cost savings by leveraging data from
telemetry technology already in place in the Argenta Group’s PoS and by increasing the use of
telemetry for PoS in France, Spain and the UK (iv) headcount reductions following the assessment of
productivity of our technicians and through the integration of corporate, IT and other central functions,
(v) footprint optimization by concentrating warehouses in the countries where both Selecta and Pelican
Rouge operate, and (vi) logistics network synergies, including planning denser and more cost-effective
routes.

   - Procurement savings of approximately €30 million, of which we had realized €22 million as of
June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized by (i) obtaining better prices on ingredients
through in-sourcing of our own brand coffee from Pelican Rouge’s roaster facility and international
tender of raw materials used across the countries in which we operate, such as sugar, (ii) harmonizing
prices of products we purchase for our PoS (such as snacks or cold drinks) by leveraging our scale and
negotiating prices through strategic relationships at the Group level, (iii) savings on disposables, such
as cups for our PoS, and packaging through leveraging our increased purchasing volume at the Group
level, (iv) streamlining purchases of spare parts for our PoS, (v) indirect cost savings on our fleet, IT,
marketing, and warehouses, and (vi) real estate savings as a result of terminating redundant leases and
renegotiating existing leases.

   - Selling, general, and administrative cost savings of approximately €13 million, of which we had
realized €12 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized through
(i) headcount reductions as a result of integrating management teams in countries where both Selecta
and Pelican Rouge operate and re-sizing our sales force, (ii) savings in connection with headcount
reductions in the research and development department of the Group by leveraging Argenta’s research
and development expertise, (iii) reductions in employee benefit expenses, such as cars, travel, and
mobile phones, in connection with headcount reductions, (iv) combining headquarters in countries
where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate and (v) additional productivity gains in sales, general
and administrative costs.

As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have incurred approximately €25 million in costs and capital
expenditures to implement the foregoing synergies, and estimate that we will incur approximately €28 million in
further costs and capital expenditures to realize our total targeted cost synergies. In particular, we expect to incur
(i) total estimated severance costs of approximately €24 million, of which approximately €10 million have

69


-----

already been incurred as of June 30, 2019, and (ii) estimated integration costs of approximately €29 million, of
which approximately €14 million have already been incurred as of June 30, 2019.

Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected synergies reflected above, no assurance can be
given that such levels will be achieved in the timeframe indicated or at all or that additional unanticipated costs
will not arise. We currently estimate the majority of the cost to achieve the anticipated synergies to be personnel
reductions and related costs that may be required under the laws of the various countries where we operate,
which we expect to continue incurring over the course of the next one to two years. As part of our reorganization
plan, we are required to negotiate severance payments with worker representatives (labor unions) for FTEs being
made redundant pursuant to a collective dismissal procedure provided under applicable regulations in various of
the countries where we operate. While we fully intend to observe the relevant legal procedures and requirements
and to negotiate in good faith, if we cannot reach an agreement on severance payments with such worker
representatives or the employees, they may choose to bring administrative or judicial challenges, which could
delay the achievement of our synergies and/or increase costs incurred in order to achieve such synergies.

Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available
to us and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently
uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates, including those
described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to realize the anticipated
_operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge_
_Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition).” See also “Forward-Looking_
_Statements.”_

**Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Statements**

**_Acquisitions and Disposals_**

The comparability of our results of operations is affected by acquisitions and disposals. On August 17, 2018,
we completed the Express Vending Acquisition; on February 2, 2018, we completed the Argenta Acquisition;
and on September 7, 2017, we completed the Pelican Rouge Acquisition. We have included the operations of
each of these entities in our audited consolidated financial information as of each of their respective acquisition
dates. As a result, our audited consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended September 30,
2018, includes the operations of Express Vending from August 17, 2018 to September 30, 2018, the operations of
the Argenta Group from February 2, 2018 to September 30, 2018, and the full year results of operations of the
Pelican Rouge Group. Since our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018 do not
include the full year results of operations of the Express Vending Group and the Argenta Group, the
comparability of our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018 and as of and for the
nine months ended June 30, 2019, with our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017,
and as of and for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, is significantly limited.

In addition, in connection with the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, in March 2018 we disposed of our Selecta
operations in Finland (“legacy Selecta Finland”) to comply with antitrust requirements. For the year ended
September 30, 2017, legacy Selecta Finland generated €13.9 million in revenue. As a result of applying IFRS 5
to our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2017, the assets and liabilities relating to legacy
Selecta Finland are presented separately in dedicated lines in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30,
2017. The assets presented separately as “assets classified as held for sale” in our consolidated balance sheet as
of September 30, 2017, are valued at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The
corresponding liabilities are presented separately as “liabilities associated with assets held for sale” in the
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017.

On September 19, 2018, we sold Custompack to PortionPack Europe Group. Custompack focuses on the
provision of single portion items such as wet sauces, dry products, and portion packing to its customers. Given
Selecta’s strategy around strengthening its leading position as unattended self-service convenience food and
beverage operator in Europe, Custompack was divested as a non-core business. The net disposal accounting gain
recorded on the sale amounted to €0.6 million.

We also disposed of our operations in the Baltic countries (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) in March 2017.

**_Categorization of Reporting Segments and Business Channels_**

_Geographic Segments_

Following the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition, we have recategorized our
geographic areas and the countries in each area for our financial statements. As a result, our audited consolidated
financial information as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018, includes financial data for three new
geographic segments (South, UK & Ireland, Central, and North), which significantly differ from our previous
four geographic areas (France, West, Central, and North). See “—Our Segments and Business Channels—
_Geographic Segments.” For comparative purposes, our 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements include our_
results according to the three new geographic segments for the year ended September 30, 2017. Therefore, the
comparability of our results of operations by geographic segments as of and for the years ended September 30,
2017 and 2018, with our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, is significantly
limited.

_Business Channels_

Beginning October 1, 2017, we categorized our revenue by business channels for our financial statements.
As a result, our subsequent financial statements include our revenue by workplace, on-the-go, and trading
channels. For comparative purposes, our 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements include our results according to
such categorization for the year ended September 30, 2017. This categorization did not exist for our financial
statements for previous years and therefore our revenue by business channel for the years ended September 30,
2017 and 2018, cannot be compared with information in our financial statements for the year ended
September 30, 2016. See “—Our Segments and Business Channels—Business Channels.”

**_Changes in Accounting Policy_**

IFRS 16 (Leases) was published on January 13, 2016 and became effective on January 1, 2019. As our
financial year begins on October 1[st] each year, we will apply IFRS 16 to our financial statements beginning from
October 1, 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single accounting model for lessees that principally obligates lessees to
account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease contracts with a term of more than twelve months.
The significant impact of IFRS 16 is the elimination of the classification according to IAS 17 (Leases) of lease
contracts as operating leases and finance leases. As a result, leases, which were shown off-balance sheet
according to IAS 17, will be recognized as a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet as of
October 1, 2019. We intend to apply the modified retrospective approach to adopt IFRS 16, and will not restate
comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption. IFRS 16 will primarily affect the accounting for our
operating leases. We currently expect that IFRS 16 will lead to an increase in total assets and total liabilities of
approximately €150 million from the effect of recognizing existing operating leases on the balance sheet.
Additionally, annual operating lease expenses of approximately €40 million are expected to be presented as
depreciation and interest expenses in the future, with a reduction for a similar amount in rent expenses, as part of
our operating expenses. As a result of the implementation of IFRS 16, the comparability of our results presented
in our future financial statements will be significantly limited compared to our Historical Financial Statements.

**Description of Key Income Statement Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue means our gross revenue from our publicly accessible PoS, our privately placed PoS and from
trade sales of machines and products, including sale of our private coffee brands, Pelican Rouge and Miofino, to
businesses, such as restaurants, coffee shops and self-service retail operators and in limited quantities directly to
consumers. It also includes revenue from the rendering of technical services and rental income from PoS placed
at customer sites under a rental contract and rental of advertising space.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the goods are delivered to the customer’s site or when
goods are purchased from a PoS by a consumer, depending on the contract terms. Revenue may be received
directly in the form of cash from the consumer, or may be invoiced to a customer periodically. Where revenue is
received in the form of cash, the amount recognized is the amount of cash received until the last date on which
the cash was collected from the PoS, plus an estimate of the sales between this date and the period end. This
estimate is calculated based on historical trends of sales from PoS in similar areas. Where the sale of goods is
invoiced to the customer, the amount recognized is based either on the amounts delivered to the customer or on
the consumption in the PoS, depending on the specific contractual terms.

**_Vending Fee_**

Vending fee relates to the consideration Selecta pays to its customers for the use of the location on the
customer’s premises to install, operate, supply, and maintain PoS.

**_Materials and Consumables Used_**

Materials and consumables used primarily relates to our cost of materials (which mainly consists of
ingredients and products used to fill our PoS or for trade sales, spare parts used in servicing our PoS and the cost
of machines sold as trade business) adjusted for rebates and discounts.

**_Employee Benefits Expense_**

Employee benefits expense consists of wages and salaries as well as social security costs and postemployment benefits under defined contributions and benefit plans.

**_Depreciation, Amortization, and Impairment Expense_**

Depreciation, amortization, and impairments relate to depreciation of property, plant and equipment, which
we initially recognize at cost and depreciate using a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and
amortization and impairment of tangible and intangible assets.

**_Other Operating Expenses_**

Other operating expenses primarily consist of maintenance, administration expense and travel and
representation expenses and non-vending fee expenses.

**_Finance Costs and Finance Income_**

Net finance costs consist of finance costs, net of finance income. Financial costs consist of interest on bank
loans, finance lease expense and other interest expense as well as changes in the fair value of derivative financial
instruments and net foreign exchanges gains or losses. Finance income consists of gains generated on foreign
exchange transactions, interest on cash deposits and fair value gains on derivative financial instruments.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes represent income and expenses in respect of current and deferred income taxes.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €129.3 million, or 11.9%, from €1,084.4 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2018, to €1,213.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the
acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €111.3 million to our revenue for
the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was partly offset
by the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which had a negative impact of €13.2 million on our revenue over the same
period. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals, our revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2019,
would have increased by €31.3 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to an
increase of €19.6 million in revenue from our public business channel in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands
and in the Central region, and an increase of €16.1 million in trade machine sales, primarily in the North region.
This increase was partly offset by our results of operations in France and the United Kingdom where we are
currently implementing our turnaround plans.

_Vending Fee_

Vending fee increased by €17.4 million, or 16.0%, from €108.6 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2018, to €126.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the
acquisition of Argenta, which contributed €7.3 million to our vending fee expenses for the nine months June 30,
2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The acquisition of Express Vending and the disposal of
Custompack Ltd. did not impact our vending fees as they had no on-the-go business during these periods.
Without giving effect to the acquisition of Argenta, our vending fees for the nine months June 30, 2019, would
have increased by €10.2 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the increase
in revenue in our public segment, which has associated vending fees.

_Materials and Consumables Used_

Expenses for materials and consumables used increased by €31.2 million, or 8.4%, from €372.2 million for
the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €403.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase
was primarily due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed
€34.9 million to materials and consumables used for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months
ended June 30, 2018. This increase was partly offset by the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which reduced

73


-----

materials and consumables used by €10.3 million over the same period. Without giving effect to acquisitions and
disposals, material and consumable expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, would have increased by
€6.5 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the increase in revenue across
the Group.

_Employee Benefits Expense_

Employee benefits expense increased by €32.7 million, or 10.2%, from €322.0 million for the nine months
ended June 30, 2018, to €354.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due
to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €34.0 million to employee
benefit expenses for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This
increase was partly offset by the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which reduced employee benefit expenses by
€3.1 million over the same period. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals, our employee benefit
expenses for the nine months June 30, 2019, would have increased by €1.8 million compared to the nine months
ended June 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to growth projects in certain countries, such as
Switzerland, and expenses incurred in connection with investments in capabilities related to strategic
transactions, which were largely offset by cost savings in connection with our synergy program and rightsizing
our operations in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and Spain.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by €16.7 million, or 12.6%, from €132.4 million for the
nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €149.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €8.3 million to
our depreciation and amortization expense, mainly through depreciation expenses, for the nine months June 30,
2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals over
the period, our depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, would have
increased by €8.4 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to amortization of
customer contracts at a Group level.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by €23.8 million, or 14.3%, from €166.9 million for the nine months
ended June 30, 2018, to €190.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due
to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €13.7 million to other
operating expenses for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018.
Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals over the period, our other operating expenses for the nine
months ended June 30, 2019, would have increased by €10.1 million compared to the nine months ended
June 30, 2018, primarily due to operating expenses, such as consulting expenses of €7.2 million incurred at our
headquarters and mainly related to strategic transactions.

_Net Finance Costs_

Net finance costs decreased by €40.7 million, or 37.2%, from €109.5 million for the nine months ended
June 30, 2018, to €68.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. The acquisitions of Argenta and
Express Vending contributed €10.5 million of net finance costs for the nine months June 30, 2019. Without
giving effect to acquisitions and disposals over the period, our net financing costs for the nine months June 30,
2019, would have decreased by €51.2 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to
foreign exchange gains on intercompany investments that are not eliminated upon consolidation of intra-group
balances.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes decreased by €5.6 million, or 76.7%, from €7.3 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2018, to €1.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This was primarily due to higher income tax
expenses in Sweden, driven by accruals for non-deductible tax relating to previous years, and higher tax expenses
in Italy primarily driven by differences in timing of accrued taxes, which decreased our income tax benefits.

2018 Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain line items in our income statement for the year ended September 30, 2018, will be
restated in our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019, to give effect to certain post-acquisition goodwill
adjustments and other accounting alignments in connection with the Argenta Acquisition, in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business
_Combinations), and other adjustments. For additional information, see note 15.1 and note 18 to our 2019 Interim Unaudited Consolidated_
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €690.1 million, or 90.6%, from €761.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2017, to €1,451.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the
acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta and Express Vending.

The table below shows our total sales by region for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2018,
respectively. The figures for the financial year 2017 have been restated in our 2018 Consolidated Financial

Revenue in our South, UK & Ireland region increased by €369.1 million, or 375.9%, from €98.2 million for
the year ended September 30, 2017, to €467.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to the impact of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition in Spain, the Argenta Acquisition in Italy and to a
lesser extent the Express Vending Acquisition in the UK. This increase was partly offset by the results of
Selecta’s legacy operations in the UK where we are currently implementing our turnaround plans.

Revenue in our Central region increased by €111.6 million, or 23.4%, from €477.9 million for the year
ended September 30, 2017 to €589.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily
driven by the impact of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition in France, and organic growth in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland. This increase was partly offset by the results of Selecta’s legacy operations in France where we are
currently implementing our turnaround plans.

Revenue in our North region increased by €230.2 million, or 124.1%, from €185.4 million for the year
ended September 30, 2017, to €415.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily

75


-----

due to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition driving growth in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Finland.
Excluding the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, we achieved organic growth in all countries, in particular in Belgium,
Norway and Denmark.

_Vending Fee_

Vending fee increased by €66.8 million, or 75.1%, from €88.9 million for the year ended September 30,
2017 to €155.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the
acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending.

_Materials and Consumables Used_

Expenses for materials and consumables used increased by €245.4 million, or 100.6%, from €244.0 million
for the year ended September 30, 2017 to €489.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, which was partly offset
by €4.7 million due to the disposal of legacy Selecta Finland.

_Employee Benefits Expense_

Employee benefits expense increased by €188.0 million, or 82.2%, from €228.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 2017, to €416.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to
the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, which was partly offset by the disposal of
legacy Selecta Finland.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by €89.6 million, or 96.1%, from €93.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 2017, to €182.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, which was partly offset by the
disposal of legacy Selecta Finland.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by €81.5 million, or 57.6%, from €141.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2017, to €223.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to
the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, coupled with integration related advisory
costs.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by €38.7 million, or 37.3%, from €103.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2017 to €142.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increase in
interest on other loans and refinancing costs, partly offset by lower foreign exchange losses in the year
September 30, 2018 as compared with the year ended September 30, 2017.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by €14.8 million, or 197.3%, from €7.5 million for the year ended September 30,
2017 to €22.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a change in the
fair value of derivative financial instruments, and currency translation effects.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes increased by €3.8 million, or 95.0%, from €4.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017
to €7.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was related to a change in deferred tax
relating to customer contracts amortization.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by €25.0 million, or 3.4%, from €736.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to
€761.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the Pelican Rouge
Acquisition, which contributed €36.6 million to our revenue from September 7, 2017, to September 30, 2017.
Without giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the disposal of our Baltics operations in 2016 (€13.3
million), revenue would have increased by €1.7 million, or 0.2%. For a detailed discussion of movements in
revenue, see the discussions for each geographic segment below.

The table below shows our total sales by geographic segment for the years ended September 30, 2016 and
2017, respectively:

**Year ended September 30,**

Revenue in our Central region increased by €14.3 million, or 4.7%, from €304.2 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016 to €318.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to
the effects of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition in Spain, and an increase of 21.7% in Germany compared to the
previous year as a result of the increased sales from the Deutsche Bahn contract, and trade sales from Shell gas
stations. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of €4.7 million in private sales in Switzerland where
new business gains were below expectation. Sales in the Swiss public segment, however, increased slightly due
to the upgrades implemented in PoS, which were fitted with telemetry, cashless payment options, and brighter
new displays.

Revenue in our North region decreased by €10.8 million, or 7.7%, from €140.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016, to €129.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due
to the disposal of our operations in the Baltic countries, which contributed €13.3 million of revenue to the Group
in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by the positive performance of our Starbucks on-the-go locations in
gas stations in Denmark.

Revenue in our France region increased by €7.3 million, or 3.9%, from €184.3 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016, to €191.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to

77


-----

an increase in sales from PoS in public spaces, specifically train stations. This growth was partially offset by a
decline in the private sales due to the removal of low-performing PoS from the PoS park.

Revenue in our West region increased by €14.4 million, or 13.3%, from €107.9 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016, to €122.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to
additional revenue resulting from the Pelican Rouge Acquisition. Consistent sales growth throughout the year at
gas stations in the Netherlands also contributed to this increase, which were partially offset by decreased private
sales in the UK.

_Materials and Consumables Used_

Expenses for materials and consumables used increased by €12.9 million, or 5.6%, from €231.1 million for
the year ended September 30, 2016 to €244.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was
primarily due to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, which contributed €15.7 million to our material and
consumables used from September 7, 2017 to September 30, 2017. Without giving effect to the Pelican Rouge
Acquisition, expenses for materials and consumables would have decreased by €2.8 million, or 1.2%, driven by
the disposal of Selecta’s operations in three Baltic countries completed on March 14, 2017, which accounted for
€6.2 million of this expense in the previous year.

_Employee Benefits Expense_

Employee benefits expense decreased by €5.5 million, or 2.3%, from €234.1 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016, to €228.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due
to a reduction in the number of FTEs in all four regions (other than Germany in the Central region), which
contributed to employee expense savings. FTE reductions were implemented for both field-force and
administrative staff, notably IT as a consequence of the outsourcing of the IT infrastructure. The Pelican Rouge
Acquisition accounted for €12.6 million of employee benefits expense from September 7, 2017, to September 30,
2017, and Selecta’s operations in the Baltics countries accounted for €1.8 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016. Without giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Baltics disposal, employee
benefit expense decreased by 7.0%.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by €1.2 million, or 1.3%, from €92.0 million for the year
ended September 30, 2016, to €93.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily
due to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, which contributed €4.1 million to our depreciation and amortization
expense from September 7, 2017, to September 30, 2017. Without giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition
and the Baltics disposal, depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by €2.9 million, or 3.1%,
primarily as a result of a reduction to the PoS park, compared to the previous year.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by €24.2 million, or 11.7%, from €206.2 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016, to €230.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to
the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and integration related advisory costs. In addition, IT outsourcing and ERP
development expenses contributed €5.3 million to our other operating expenses. Additionally, vending fees also
increased by €3.4 million to €88.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, due to an increase in public
sales. Vending fees, as a percentage of public revenue, increased by 0.5%.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by €17.9 million, or 20.9%, from €85.8 million for the year ended September 30,
2016 to €103.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a €4.9 million
increase in non-cash interest charge on shareholder loans, financing transaction costs directly attributable to the
Pelican Rouge Acquisition, and foreign exchange losses.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by €3.1 million, or 70.5%, from €4.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2016, to €7.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a change in fair
value of derivative financial instruments.

-----

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes decreased by €1.1 million, or 21.6%, from €5.1 million for the year ended September 30,
2016, to €4.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the
consolidation of Selecta headquarters in Switzerland, which led to lower income taxes and higher tax savings.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our principal sources of funds have been cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings under
the Revolving Credit Facility. Our principal uses of cash are to fund debt service obligations, working capital and
capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of €77.8 million.

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows. Our ability
to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn, depends to some extent on general
economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors.”

In addition, we have access to the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital and general
corporate needs. The continued availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon certain conditions,
including ongoing compliance with a maintenance covenant tested quarterly as described further under
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we
cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future
debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to fund
our other liquidity needs.

**Cash Movements in Working Capital**

The table below sets forth a summary of cash movements in our working capital for the periods indicated,
derived from our consolidated cash flow statements:

**Year ended** **Nine months ended**

**Cash movements in working capital** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **5.1** **26.1** **(19.4)** **(89.4)** **(59.8)**

Cash outflow from movements in working capital amounted to €59.8 million for the nine months ended
June 30, 2019, and was primarily attributable to the timing of payment of supplier invoices. Cash outflow from
movements in working capital amounted to €89.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, and was
primarily attributable to the transaction and integration costs relating to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition as well as
the timing for payment of supplier invoices. For the financial years ended September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018,
we experienced structurally negative working capital as our receivables tend to outpace our creditor payments
due to the historical phasing impact of working capital in the first half of the financial year and integration costs
in connection with our various acquisitions, which are typically paid out in the second half of the year. As of
September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018, our net working capital, which consists of inventories, trade receivables
and other current assets less trade payables and other liabilities, amounted to €(77.4) million, €(197.1) million
and €(258.4) million, respectively.

**_Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities_**

_Comparison of the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2019_

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by €40.4 million, or 129.1%, from €31.3 million for the
nine months ended June 30, 2018 to €71.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was
partially due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which contributed €11.5 million to operating
cash flows for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This increase
was partly offset by the impact of the disposal of Custompack Ltd. Without giving effect to acquisitions and
disposals over the periods, the increase in operating cash flows for the nine months June 30, 2019, was primarily
due to a decrease in losses before income tax combined with a decrease in cash outflow due to changes in
working capital.

_Comparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2017 and 2018_

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by €43.2 million, or 43.2%, from €99.9 million for the
year ended September 30, 2017 to €143.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, including synergies achieved
in employee expenses and overall operating expense.

_Comparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2017_

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by €19.7 million, or 24.6%, from €80.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 2016 to €99.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was
primarily due to lower employee expenses driven by headcount reductions and overall operating expense, partly
offset by the Pelican Rouge integration costs.

**_Net Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities_**

_Comparison of the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2019_

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased from €101.8 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2018 to €116.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher
capital expenditures following the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge and Argenta. This increase was partly offset by
proceeds from the sales of property, plant and equipment. This increase was also impacted by the proceeds from
the sale of Selecta Finland in the nine months ended June 30, 2018.

_Comparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2017 and 2018_

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased from €134.3 million for the year ended September 30,
2017 to €186.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the increased
capital expenditure for property, plant, and equipment following the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta
Acquisition while the cash outflow for acquisition of subsidiaries net of proceeds from sale of subsidiaries
remained relatively stable at €75.0 million.

80


-----

_Comparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2017_

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased from €45.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2016 to €134.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the cash
consideration of €119.2 million paid for the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, partially offset by cash acquired from
Pelican Rouge.

**_Net Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities_**

_Comparison of the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2018 and 2019_

Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased from an inflow of €53.6 million for the nine months
ended June 30, 2018, to an outflow of €47.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This decrease was
primarily due to (i) cash overfunding following the refinancing in the nine months ended June 30, 2018, (ii) the
phasing of cash interest payments with interest incurred during the year ended September 30, 2018, being paid in
the nine months ended June 30, 2019, which were partially offset by cash from additional drawings on our
Revolving Credit Facility in the nine months ended June 30, 2019.

_Comparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2017 and 2018_

Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased from €107.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2017 to €75.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. Cash inflows in 2017 were driven by the capital
contribution by KKR while the cash inflows in 2018 were mainly due to the refinancing activities in February
2018, offset by cash outflows for the repayment under factoring arrangements and higher interest payments.

_Comparison of the Years Ended September 30, 2016 and 2017_

Net cash flows used in financing activities increased to €107.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2017 from nil for the year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to a capital contribution
by KKR of €179.7 million to finance the Pelican Rouge Acquisition.

**Capital Expenditures**

Our capital expenditures primarily relate to the acquisition of PoS to be installed on our customers’
premises. Our capital expenditures also relate to the purchase of vehicles and other equipment, such as furniture,
PoS installation costs and IT investments. The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods
presented:

**Nine months ended**

**Year ended September 30,** **June 30,**

**(in € million)** **2016** **2017** **2018** **2018** **2019**

Additions to self-service retail equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61.6 65.7 99.8 71.4 96.1

**Net capital expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **71.6** **70.5** **113.5** **85.0** **108.1**

Net capital expenditures increased by €23.1 million, or 27.2%, from €85.0 million for the nine months
ended June 30, 2018, to €108.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due
to the acquisition of Argenta, which contributed €10.0 million of additional net capital expenditure for the nine
months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. Without giving effect to
acquisitions and disposals over the period, our net capital expenditure for the nine months ended June 30, 2019,
would have increased by €13.1 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to
increased investments in France following a period of underinvestment in the legacy Pelican Rouge entities, as
well as ERP development expenses and new business gains in the on-the-go segments, predominantly in the
Netherlands and Belgium.

81


-----

Net capital expenditures increased by €43.0 million, or 61.0%, from €70.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2017, to €113.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily
attributable to growth in the business in line with our investment strategy.

Net capital expenditures decreased by €1.1 million, or 1.5%, from €71.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 2016, to €70.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily
attributable to various small and medium acquisitions in 2016.

We estimate that we will require gross capital expenditures of approximately €100 million per year on PoS
to support our current PoS park and revenue levels, in addition to capital expenditure for vehicles, IT and other
equipment, of which approximately €20 million are expected to be financed through finance leases. In addition,
we believe that we will require approximately €6 million of PoS gross capital expenditures to support each
additional per cent of revenue growth. Our estimates with respect to future capital expenditure requirements may
vary based on changes in our product, concept and segment mix.

As our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on different capital intensity in
different business segments, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to new business, levels of capital
expenditure funded through new PoS versus refurbished PoS and specific initiatives to develop telemetry and
cashless payment technologies, among other factors, we cannot assure you that our level of capital expenditure
will not increase significantly in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our business
_requires capital expenditures that may divert significant cash flow from other investments or uses, including debt_
_servicing.”_

**Contractual Commitments**

The following table summarizes certain categories of our contractual obligations and commitments
(excluding factoring agreements and hedging obligations) owed to third parties excluding interest, by period, as
of June 30, 2019, on an adjusted basis after giving effect to the Offering:


**(in € million)** **Less than 1 year** **1-5 years**


**More than**
**5 years** **Total**


Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 1,465.1 — 1,465.1
Finance lease liabilities[(a)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12.9 27.7 — 40.6

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **12.9** **1,492.8** **—** **1,505.7**

(a) Finance lease liabilities relate primarily to motor vehicles and equipment. See “—Factors Affecting Comparability of our Financial
_Statements—Changes in Accounting Policy.”_

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

Our off-balance sheet liabilities relate primarily to land, buildings and vehicles under various operating
lease agreements. As of June 30, 2019, we recorded expenses of €37.3 million for payments under operating
lease agreements not recorded on our balance sheet and expenses in relation to property, plants, equipment and
vehicles (excluding vending fees). As a result of the implementation of IFRS 16 beginning October 1, 2019, such
agreements will have to be recognized on the balance sheet.

Except as described above, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are
reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to a variety of market risks including credit risk, interest
rate risk and liquidity risk. We monitor and manage these risks as a part of our overall risk management. The
following section discusses the significant financial risks to which we are exposed. This discussion does not
address other risks to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business, such as operational risks. See
“Risk Factors” and note 30 to our 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relate
primarily to our long-term debt obligations with floating rate interests.

82


-----

The Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes bear interest at variable rates. While we may
enter into hedging agreements in the future, we may also elect not to do so or the terms on which we hedge may
not be satisfactory or may fail to adequately protect us from changes in market interest rates.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from counterparty failure to repay or service debt owed to us
according to the contractual terms or obligations. We are exposed to credit risk on our trade receivables,
non-current other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.

Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and ongoing credit evaluations in all of our subsidiaries. Due to
our large geographic presence and large base of customers, we are not exposed to material concentrations of
credit risk on our trade receivables and have no significant exposure to credit risk with any single counterparty.
In addition, due the nature of our operations, a significant portion of our revenue is received in cash.

We do not believe we are exposed to significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents as these are
spread over several financial institutions in different countries.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill present or future obligations if we do not have sufficient
funds available to meet such obligations at the time they become due. Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to
cash flows generated and used in working capital and from financing activities, particularly by servicing our
debt, in terms of both interest and capital, and our payment obligations relating to our ordinary business
activities. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring our expected cash flows and working capital
levels and ensuring that adequate borrowing facilities are maintained.

We have several thresholds and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for using
derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency
without the approval of our Chief Financial Officer. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency
exposures without the approval of our Chief Financial Officer. Wherever possible, we require that subsidiaries
repatriate all their excess cash and bank balances to Group finance companies to allow the Group to ensure that
adequate funds are made available across the Group as necessary.

**_Foreign Currency Risk_**

Since each of our subsidiaries invoices its customers in the functional currency in which that subsidiary
operates, and since the significant part of its cost base is also denominated in its functional currency, our
exposure to currency risk is not significant.

Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of operations whose functional currency is not the euro
in our financial statements which are presented in euro. Previously, in order to minimize our exposure to
translation risk, we had established the borrowings and related interest payments in the four main currencies in
which we operate, namely EUR, CHF, GBP and SEK, in order to effect a natural hedge between our income and
interest expenses. As of June 30, 2019 €1,163 million of our Existing Notes and our borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility were denominated in EUR, 225 million in CHF and 34 million in GBP, and changes in
foreign exchange rates will therefore give rise to foreign exchange exposure. While we may enter into hedging
agreements in the future, we may also elect not to do so or the terms on which we hedge may not be satisfactory
or may fail to adequately protect us from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

**_Commodity Risk_**

We are exposed to commodity price risk because of coffee price fluctuations. Some of these fluctuations can
be passed on to customers through price increases in line with contractual conditions. In order to manage risks
from fluctuations in commodities prices, we secure the requirements for green bean for periods of up to six
months by instructing the relevant supplier to source the required green beans to cover certain production lots at a
specific price. With certain strategic suppliers, we enter into longer-term agreements with agreed price
adjustment mechanisms that reflect developments in commodity prices. We periodically assess the economic
impact of hedging coffee bean prices but consider the hedging cost too high to make hedging financially
attractive. However, while we do not enter into hedging instruments with respect to coffee prices, coffee volumes
are committed with suppliers between one and six months in advance depending on current green bean coffee
prices and expectations of future price development.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our Historical Financial Statements and the accompanying notes contain information that is pertinent to the
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition set forth above. The preparation of
our Historical Financial Statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results
may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in future periods are summarized
below. For a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies, see note 3 of our 2018 Consolidated
Financial Statements.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives_**

The cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The
recoverable amounts of cash generating units and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are determined
based on their values in use. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with the
most up-to-date business plans that have been formally approved by management.

**_Customer Contracts_**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of customer contracts in a business combination have a finite
useful life and are amortized over the determined life of 10 or 15 years. We actively monitor retention rates on
customer contracts and consider other relevant factors which may provide an indication of impairment.

**_Employee Benefits_**

The present value of the pension obligations depends on a variety of factors that are estimated annually by
independent actuaries using a number of assumptions, including the discount rate to be applied to determine the
present value of defined benefit obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, we consider the interest
rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and
that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.

**_Deferred Income Tax Assets_**

Deferred income tax assets on unused tax losses carried forward are recognized to the extent it is probable
that there will be future taxable profits against which the losses can be offset. The assessment of recoverability of
the recognized deferred income tax assets is based on assumptions regarding future profits and is derived from
the latest budgets and business plans of the Group.

**_Provisions_**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is based on
management’s best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting
period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Provisions for warranties are
ordinarily determined by product line and are based on statistics including the likelihood of a breakdown
occurring and the average cost of repair or replacement.

**_Sales Estimates_**

Where sales are based on consumption in the PoS, there may be a timing difference between the date on
which the cash was last collected from the PoS and the date on which the sales readings were taken. In this case,
an estimate of the sales between the date of the last cash collection or the last PoS reading and the end of the
period is made. The estimate is based on historical sales trends in respect of the specific customer sites and PoS.
The estimated amount of sales which have been neither collected in cash nor invoiced to customers are recorded
as accrued income and uncollected cash in points-of-sale.

84


-----

**_Inventories_**

Food and beverage inventories which have passed their sell by date are fully provided against. Similarly,
where the level of food and beverage inventories held exceeds the sales expected to be achieved before the sell
by date, a provision is made for the excess inventory held. Provisions for equipment in inventory are recorded
against PoS in inventory according to the age of the PoS. Provisions for spare parts held in inventory are
calculated according to the inventory turnover ratio.

**UNAUDITED NON-GAAP AGGREGATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

_The following Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information presents certain of our income_
_statement line items and other financial data on a constant scope and constant currency basis. The following_
_Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information is based on, and should be read in conjunction with,_
_our Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere herein and the sections in this Offering Memorandum_
_titled “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Selected Historical Financial Data,” and_
_“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Unaudited_
_Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any generally_
_accepted accounting standards nor with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus_
_Regulation, or any other regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, or any other regulator. The_
_Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been derived by applying adjustments to our_
_Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, which adjustments are not_
_recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards._

_The results of operation for each of the Pelican Rouge Group, the Argenta Group and the Express Vending_
_Group are represented in our Historical Financial Statements only as of the respective date of each of their_
_acquisition. As a result, our Historical Financial Statements are not directly comparable with each other for_
_each of the relevant periods. We also completed a number of disposals between 2016 and 2018, which also affect_
_the comparability of our financial results between periods._

_We present in this section certain unaudited financial data for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019,_
_which has been derived mathematically by adding the financial data for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, to_
_the financial data for the year ended September 30, 2018, and subtracting the financial data for the nine months_
_ended June 30, 2018._

_The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been derived by applying adjustments to_
_our Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, which adjustments are_
_not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. The Unaudited Non-GAAP_
_Aggregated Financial Information reflects the application of adjustments that are based upon available_
_management account information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the_
_circumstances. We have not included notes describing all the assumptions made in our Unaudited Non-GAAP_
_Aggregated Financial Information. Actual results may differ materially from the Unaudited Non-GAAP_
_Aggregated Financial Information. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting_
_Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been audited or reviewed. The Unaudited_
_Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information is not, and does not purport to be, pro forma financial data that_
_has been prepared, audited, or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted accounting or auditing_
_standards, and should not be read as such. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other_
_Information—Historical_ _Consolidated_ _Financial_ _Information—Other_ _Financial_ _Data_ _and_ _Operating_
_Information.” The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information is not directly comparable with, or_
_representative of, our future operating results and cash flows._

**Description of Adjustments to the Unaudited Aggregated Non-GAAP Financial Information**

The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been derived by applying certain
adjustments to each of our Historical Financial Statements and the financial statements of the Pelican Rouge
Group, the Argenta Group and the Express Vending Group for the relevant periods in order to aid in their
comparability. Such adjustments fall within two categories, adjusting for the scope of the financial information
included (constant scope adjustments) and the exchange rates used in respect of the financial information
recorded in currencies other than euro (constant currency adjustments), as described in detail below.

**_Constant Scope Adjustments_**

The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been adjusted to give effect to the
transactions described below, as if they had occurred on October 1, 2015, to the extent they were not already
reflected in the relevant period:

   - the acquisition by Selecta AG of Pelican Rouge Group, which occurred on September 7, 2017, and
contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 6, 2017;

   - the acquisition by TopCo of Argenta Group, which occurred on February 2, 2018, and contributes to
the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to February 1, 2018;

86


-----

   - the acquisition by Selecta AG of Express Vending Group, which occurred on August 17, 2018, and
contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to August 16, 2018;

   - the disposal of Pelican Rouge subsidiaries in Sweden, which occurred in March 2016, and contributes
to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in March 2016;

   - the disposal of Pelican Rouge subsidiaries in Germany, which occurred in March 2016, and contributes
to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in March 2016;

   - the disposal of Selecta subsidiaries in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which occurred in March 2017,
and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016;

   - the disposal of a Selecta subsidiary in Finland, which occurred in March 2018, and contributes to the
adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2017; and

   - the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which occurred on September 19, 2018, and contributes to the
adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 18, 2018.

While the Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been adjusted to reflect acquisitions
that we consider significant, it does not reflect all acquisitions we have completed during the relevant period. We
categorize acquisitions of businesses with less than €3.0 million in gross sales for the twelve months preceding
such acquisition as part of our organic growth. Consequently, transactions involving such acquisitions are not
included in the constant scope adjustments to our Historical Financial Statements.

In addition to the above, adjustments have been made to align the fiscal period of acquired companies with
Selecta’s financial year and also as a result of accounting policy differences and reclassifications, as further
detailed below under “—Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) and Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC)” and “—Adjusted
_EBITDA (CS & CC).”_

**_Constant Currency Adjustments_**

We are a geographically diversified business with operations in 16 countries across Europe and accordingly
we undertake transactions in various currencies. Many of our subsidiaries report their financial results in
currencies other than the euro, the reporting currency used in our Historical Financial Statements. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and
_Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk.” To enhance the comparability of our_
financial results, such results are presented using a constant exchange rate across all periods presented. Measures
calculated using constant exchange rates are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. The
exchange rates used for the calculation of constant exchange rate measures presented in this Offering
Memorandum have been derived from the European Central Bank as of September 2017, which constitute our
budget exchange rates for the financial years 2018 and 2019 as set out in the following table:

(1) Represents the gross revenue of Selecta for the periods presented based on our Historical Financial Statements for each period.

(2) Represents the revenue contribution of Pelican Rouge to illustrate the addition of Pelican Rouge’s revenue to the Group’s revenue for
each period presented prior to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, based on Pelican Rouge’s financial statements for each period, and to
exclude Pelican Rouge revenue for the 24-day period from the closing of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition through September 30, 2017.
The constant scope adjustments include adjustments made in respect of aligning Pelican Rouge’s financial year with Selecta’s financial
year, based on Pelican Rouge’s audited financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, interim financial statements
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017, and management accounts for the six months ended September 30, 2015.

(3) Represents the revenue contribution of the Argenta Group to illustrate the addition of Argenta’s revenue to the Group’s revenue for each
period presented prior to the Argenta Acquisition, based on Argenta’s financial statements for each period. Because the Argenta
Acquisition occurred prior to Argenta’s preparation of its interim financial results, the calculation of Argenta’s revenue between
October 1, 2017, and February 2, 2018, is based on management records.

(4) Represents the revenue contribution of the Express Vending Group to illustrate the addition of Express Vending’s revenue to the Group’s
revenue for each period presented prior to the Express Vending Acquisition, based on Express Vending’s management accounts. Express
Vending’s revenue is converted from pound sterling to euro for each period at the applicable exchange rates used by Selecta in its

(October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in March 2016), (ii) Pelican Rouge Swedish entities (October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in
March 2016), (iii) Selecta subsidiaries in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia (October 1, 2015, through September 30, 2016), (iv) Selecta
subsidiaries in Finland (October 1, 2015, through September 30, 2017), and (v) Custompack Ltd. (October 1, 2015, through
September 18, 2018).

(6) Represents (i) certain IFRS and accounting policy adjustments in respect of vendor leases that are capitalized into the purchase price of
machinery, (ii) certain reclassifications representing differences in accounting policy at Argenta in respect of revenue recognition relating
to marketing contribution, transportation costs, and non-recurring income, and (iii) adjustments to convert the revenue from Pelican
Rouge’s subsidiaries in the UK and Norway to euro for each period under review at the exchange rates used in the relevant Historical
Financial Statements.

(7) Other adjustments include, among others, revenues of Selecta Finland that were classified as intercompany revenues in Selecta’s
accounting records and that are reclassified as third party revenue to give effect to the disposal of our subsidiary in Finland in March
2018.

(8) Represents adjustments to exclude the effects of changes in currency value in the relevant periods based on a constant currency rate, as
set out under “—Description of Adjustments to the Unaudited Aggregated Non-GAAP Financial Information—Constant Currency
_Adjustments.”_

(9) Represents the vending fees for each of Selecta, Pelican Rouge and Argenta, adjusted for scope and reconciliation, reclassification, and
constant currency adjustments, each as detailed above.

(1) The UK contributed €200.7 million, €190.4 million, and €189.2 million, to our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the years ended
September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively, and €186.2 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

(2) France contributed €298.2 million, €287.9 million, and €295.6 million, to our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the years ended
September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively, and €285.3 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

**_Comparison of Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019, to the Nine Months_**
**_Ended June 30, 2018_**

Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, amounted to €1,217.7 million, an
increase of €40.4 million, or 3.4% compared to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,177.3 million for the nine
months ended June 30, 2018. Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, increased
in all the countries in which we operate, except in France and the UK due to customer retention challenges and a
decrease in the size of the machine park related to the legacy Pelican Rouge business. However, Adjusted
Revenue (CS &CC) in the UK for the three months ended June 30, 2019, increased compared to the three months
ended June 30, 2018, due to a new contract with Coca Cola.

   - _South, UK & Ireland. Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the nine_
months ended June 30, 2019, increased by €17.0 million compared to the nine months ended June 30,
2018. This increase was primarily due to successful bolt-on acquisitions in Italy and organic revenue
growth and bolt-on acquisitions in Spain, where we won a new contract with the Madrid airport driving
significantly higher revenue from our public business channel. In addition, the revenue of Express
Vending in the UK grew by 13.7% for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the nine
months ended June 30, 2018.

   - _North. Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the North region for the nine months ended June 30, 2019,_
increased by €25.2 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due an increase in
revenue from our public business channel in the Netherlands and in Belgium following a new contract
with Euro Garages in these countries, and from our trade business channel in Sweden, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Norway.

   - _Central. Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the Central region for the nine months ended June 30, 2019,_
decreased by €1.8 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was due to a
€10.3 million decrease in Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in France. Excluding our results of operations
in France, Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in our region Central increased by €8.5 million or 3.8%,
driven by organic growth in our public business channel in Switzerland, as well as revenue growth in
our trade business due to bolt-on acquisitions. Our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the nine months
ended June 30, 2019, also increased by €1.2 million or 2.7% in Germany due to Adjusted Revenue
(CS & CC) growth in our private business channel, mainly related to our new contract with Daimler.

**_Comparison of Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the Year Ended September 30, 2018, to the Year Ended_**
**_September 30, 2017_**

Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2018, amounted to €1,564.3 million, an
increase of €58.7 million, or 3.9% compared to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,505.5 million for the year
ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the harmonization of vending fees across the

89


-----

Group, which was completed during the year ended September 30, 2018, and resulted in an alignment of
reporting practices between legacy Selecta entities and the integrated entities of Pelican Rouge and Argenta. We
harmonized our reporting practices based on reporting standards applicable to our business models. This
harmonization of vending fees resulted in an increase in Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the year ended
September 30, 2018, of €25.8 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, with a positive impact on
our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in certain countries, mainly in Switzerland, France and the UK, which was
partly offset by a negative impact on our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in Italy. Without giving effect to the
harmonization of vending fees, Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2018, amounted
to €1,538.5 million, an increase of €32.9 million, or 2.2%, compared to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of
€1,505.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017.

Our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2018, increased in all our markets,
except in the UK, compared to the year ended September 30, 2017.

   - _South, UK & Ireland. Our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the_
year ended September 30, 2018, increased by €13.7 million (without giving effect to harmonization of
vending fees) compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to growth in Adjusted
Revenue (CS & CC) in Italy and Spain. Our operations in Spain benefitted from the development of
new concepts and higher daily revenue per PoS across all business channels, whereas growth in sales in
Italy was supported by the development of new concepts, bolt-on acquisitions and improved daily
revenue per PoS in the workplace channel. This increase was partially offset by lower sales in the UK
due to the legacy Pelican Rouge business and customer retention challenges in the first part of the year
ended September 30, 2018.

   - _North. Our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the North region for the year ended September 30, 2018,_
increased by €14.4 million (without giving effect to harmonization of vending fees) compared to the
year ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth in Sweden,
Belgium, Norway and Denmark, mainly from an increase in trading sales and, to a lesser extent,
successful rollouts in our semi-public business in Sweden and Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth in
or public business in Belgium and Denmark.

   - _Central. Our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the Central region for the year ended September 30,_
2018, increased by €5.6 million (without giving effect to harmonization of vending fees) compared to
the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC)
growth in Austria and, to a lesser extent, in Switzerland and Germany. We also benefitted from an
increase in Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in France in our public business channel, partly offset by
lower sales in the workplace and semi-public channels due to a decrease in sales from legacy Pelican
Rouge entities and customer retention challenges in France.

**_Comparison of Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the Year Ended September 30, 2017, to the Year Ended_**
**_September 30, 2016_**

Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2017, amounted to €1,505.5 million, an
increase of €4.9 million, or 0.3% compared to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,500.7 million for the year
ended September 30, 2016.

   - _South, UK & Ireland. Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the year_
ended September 30, 2017, decreased by €1.9 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016.
This increase was primarily due to revenue growth in Italy, driven by revenue from new contracts as
well as positive pricing effects and acquisitions, and in the UK due to an increase of 13.6% in Adjusted
Revenue (CS & CC) from Express Vending. This increase was partly offset by a decrease in revenue
from the legacy Pelican Rouge business in the UK driven by the loss of key contracts.

   - _North. Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the North region for the year ended September 30, 2017,_
increased by €8.0 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily
due to the introduction of the Starbucks concept in gas stations in the Netherlands and in Denmark,
which led to significant gains in our public business channel. We also benefitted from an increase of
4.9% in Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) from our roaster over the periods.

   - _Central. Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the Central region for the year ended September 30, 2017,_
decreased by €2.2 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily
due to lower revenue from the Pelican Rouge entities in France driven by the loss of key contracts. This

90


-----

decrease was partly offset by Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) increase in Germany driven by higher
revenue in our public business channel due to new contracts with Deutsche Bahn and Frankfurt
Airport.

run-rate cost synergies from these acquisitions by the end of 2020. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have
realized approximately €52 million of these cost synergies, which represents 69% of our total expected cost synergies. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in_
_connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition)”_

**_Comparison of Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019, to the Nine Months_**
**_Ended June 30, 2018_**

Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, amounted to €201.0 million, an
increase of €17.8 million, or 9.7% compared to Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) of €183.2 million for the nine
months ended June 30, 2018. We achieved synergies and cost savings of €24 million for the nine months ended
June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. We also undertook significant growth
investments over the period, primarily consisting of investments in (i) our sales force to drive organic growth;
(ii) innovation, mainly new concepts and digitalization; (iii) infrastructure and (iv) our support functions such as
legal, finance and human resources, to activate strategic business partnership; and (v) off-balance sheet financing
projects to implement our strategy of optimizing capital expenditures. This increase was also due to an increase
of €2.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the nine
months ended June 30, 2018, due to bolt-on acquisitions, mainly in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany and the
UK. Below is a discussion of drivers for the increase in our Adjusted EBITDA (CS &CC) for the nine months
ended June 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018:

   - _South, UK & Ireland. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the nine_
months ended June 30, 2019, increased by €5.3 million compared to the nine months ended June 30,
2018, primarily due to an increase in revenue in Spain and from Express Vending, as well as cost
savings and rightsizing personnel and overhead expenses reductions in the UK.

   - _North. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the North region for the nine months ended June 30, 2019,_
increased by €15.8 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to higher
revenue across the region over the period, including from our roaster business which benefitted from
favorable coffee prices.

   - _Central. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the Central region for the nine months ended June 30, 2019,_
decreased by €4.7 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was due to our
results of operations in France, where our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the nine months ended
June 30, 2019, declined by €8.5 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This
decrease was partly offset by our results in Switzerland driven by higher revenue and operational
excellence initiatives.

   - _Headquarters. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) at our Headquarters for the nine months ended June 30,_
2019, increased by €1.5 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to our
leaner corporate structure.

Our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margin for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 (calculated as Adjusted
EBITDA (CS & CC) divided by Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC)), remained stable compared to the nine
months ended June 30, 2018, due to the usually low margin in trade sales being offset by procurement synergy
savings as well as pricing and category managements initiatives.

**_Comparison of Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the Year Ended September 30, 2018, to the Year Ended_**
**_June 30, 2017_**

Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2018, amounted to €253.3 million, an
increase of €13.3 million, or 5.5% compared to Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) of €240.0 million for the year
ended September 30, 2017. We achieved reduction of operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018,
compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, as a result of our cost savings initiatives. These savings were
partly reinvested in operational capabilities, mainly in sales, and to develop technology and off-balance sheet
financing projects to optimize capital expenditures.

   - _South, UK & Ireland. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the year_
ended September 30, 2018, increased by €9.1 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2017.
This increase was primarily due to the performance of our business in Spain across all business
channels and synergies achieved in Spain and in the UK through rightsizing personnel and overhead
expenses reductions.

   - _North. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the North region for the year ended September 30, 2018,_
increased by €1.3 million, compared to the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was due to
the performance of our business in the region, partly offset by higher sales from our trade business
channel, which is less profitable, and investments in operational capabilities and off-balance sheet
financing projects to optimize capital expenditures, which impacted operating expenses.

   - _Central. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the Central region for the year ended September 30, 2018,_
decreased by €8.8 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, mainly due to significant
one-time income in the year ended September 30, 2017 that did not recur in the year ended
September 30, 2018 related to, among others, pension adjustments in Switzerland, partly offset by the
performance of our business in France.

   - _Headquarters. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) at our Headquarters for the year ended September 30,_
2018, increased by €11.7 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, driven by a
€12 million benefit from a one-off reset of pension plans in a legacy Pelican Rouge headquarter entity
in the UK.

Our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margin for the year ended September 30, 2018 (calculated as Adjusted
EBITDA (CS & CC) divided by Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC)) remained stable compared to the year ended
September 30, 2017, due to the usually low margin in trade sales being offset by procurement synergy savings as
well as pricing and category managements initiatives.

**_Comparison of Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the Year Ended September 30, 2017, to the Year Ended_**
**_September 30, 2016_**

Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2017, amounted to €240.0 million, an
increase of €5.9 million, or 2.5%, compared to Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) of €234.1 million for the year
ended September 30, 2016.

   - _South, UK & Ireland. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the year_
ended September 30, 2017, decreased by €2.5 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016.
This decrease was primarily due to higher personnel costs following machine park increases in Italy
and higher national labor contract rates, which offset the performance of our business in Italy. To a
lesser extent, this decrease was also attributable to the performance of our business in the UK, which
was largely offset by personnel and operating costs savings with respect to Selecta and Pelican Rouge
entities in the UK.

   - _North. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the North region for the year ended September 30, 2017,_
increased by €0.9 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the
performance of our business in the Netherlands and Denmark, which was largely offset by a decrease
in profit in Sweden due to the increased use of customer-owned machines which lead to lower service
fees.

   - _Central. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the Central region for the year ended September 30, 2017,_
increased by €6.0 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016. This increase was primarily
due to the profitability of our business in Switzerland, driven by savings in personnel expenses and
increases in non-operating income, and, to a lesser extent, lower cost of sales in the region due to the

94


-----

termination of low-margin contracts and procurement and costs savings initiatives. This increase was
partially offset by a decrease in profits in France due to the legacy Pelican Rouge entities.

   - _Headquarters. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) at our Headquarters for the year ended September 30,_
2017, increased by €1.5 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to
lower expenditures at Pelican Rouge headquarters.

Our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margin for the year ended September 30, 2017 (calculated as Adjusted
EBITDA (CS & CC) divided by Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC)) remained stable compared to the year ended
September 30, 2016, due to the usually low margin in trade sales being offset by procurement synergy savings as
well as pricing and category managements initiatives.

**INDUSTRY**

**Leading Route-Based Unattended Self Service Coffee and Convenience Food Provider in Europe**

We are the leading route-based unattended self-service and convenience food provider in the European
region, with an installed base of over 475,000 PoS. We operate in 16 countries, covering approximately 95% of
European GDP and approximately 78% of the population. According to OC&C and our internal estimates, we
have the number one or number two market position in the Unattended SSR Market (as defined below) in all but
one of the Focus Countries (as defined below). Overall, we have the number one or number two market position
in ten of our markets. Moreover, we are number one in Europe with approximately 10% market share. We
believe that our adjusted revenue (on a constant scope and constant currency basis) for the year ended
September 30, 2018, was approximately 3.5 times higher than the second largest competitor.

**Market Opportunity of the Convenience Market**

According to OC&C, the total out-of-home food and drink market is €845 billion. This includes all spend at
restaurants, cafes and bars, and unattended self-service retail items. Within the total out-of-home food and
beverage market, we operate in the Addressable Market (as defined below) of €42 billion, consisting of all
convenience spend on hot and cold beverages, and snacks. The Unattended Self Service Retail Market is a subset
of the Addressable Market, and is estimated to be €15 billion. It includes both Unattended Self Service Retail (at
work and on-the-go) and capsule coffee at the office.

**_Definition and Overview of the Core Unattended Self-Service Retail and Addressable Markets_**

We operate within the Unattended SSR Market, which can be categorized into two main segments:
Workplace which includes private segment and OCS, and on-the-go which includes public and semi-public
segment. We estimate that the Unattended SSR Market is a €15 billion market in the Focus Countries. Through
the continued development and expansion of new concepts, such as MicroMarkets, we are increasingly involved
in the broader addressable convenience market (the “Addressable Market”), which spans the Unattended SSR
Market, as well as the broader convenience market with other retail formats (e.g. street stalls, kiosks and
convenience stores), and has a market size of €42 billion in the Focus Countries. The Addressable Market can
also be categorized into the two segments of workplace and on-the-go. Within the Addressable Market, in
addition to Unattended SSR Market, the workplace segment includes cafeterias and the on-the-go segment
includes convenience foodservice and packaged foods.

The workplace segment aims at improving the experience of people at work, for example by enhancing
employee engagement, satisfaction, and productivity in the work environment. Through vending and office
coffee services, unattended self-service retailers, such as us, service private businesses and corporate offices in
places generally not accessible by other retail formats.

Unattended self-service retailers that enter into three to five year contacts with corporate customers receive
proceeds through sale of goods from impulse and coffee machines, servicing fees and revenues from sales of
coffee beans and other consumables. We pay rent to selected large private customers based on percentage of
sales, a flat fee, or a combination thereof.

The workplace segment accounted for approximately 36% (by value) of the Addressable Market in the
Focus Countries in 2017. In addition to self-service PoS, this segment includes cafeteria and capsules, whereby
cafeterias include hot drinks and snacks, but exclude warm lunches, and capsules include machines and capsules
provided by the employer in small and medium office environments.

The on-the-go segment aims to enhance the consumer experience by providing tailored coffee and snacking
offerings in public (e.g. train and gas stations or airports) and semi-public locations (e.g. hospitals and public
schools). Contracts typically range between five to ten years. We receive proceeds from the sales of goods from
PoS and pay rent to customers based on a percentage of sales, a flat fee, or a combination thereof.

The on-the-go segment accounted for approximately 64% (by value) of the Addressable Market in the Focus
Countries in 2017. In addition to self-service PoS, this segment includes convenience foodservice and packaged
food retailing. Convenience foodservice includes products prepared for take-away/ready-to-eat, hot drinks
(especially coffee), as well as value-add drinks sold in street stalls, kiosks and specialized coffee shops. Packaged
food retailing includes packaged food, confectionary items, snacks and soft drinks sold in convenience stores and
forecourt retailers.

Within the Unattended SSR Market, approximately 85% (by value) is in the workplace segment in the Focus
Countries in 2017. This segment includes PoS located in private businesses and is comprised of (i) fully operated
PoS offering hot drinks and impulse items (cold drinks and snacks) (i.e., private self-service retail), and
(ii) coffee machines (often table-top) operated (cleaned and refilled) by the employer located in private
businesses (i.e., OCS).

The remainder of the Unattended SSR Market (approximately 15% by value) in the Focus Countries in 2017
lies in the on-the-go segment. This segment includes the sale of hot drinks and impulse items at public locations
(e.g. train stations, gas stations) and semi-public locations (e.g. hospitals, universities).

The trade segment provides a full suite of services and coffee and coffee related products to customers.
Selecta receives proceeds from the sales of roasted coffee beans, PoS, other goods, and third party technical
servicing.

**Overview of the Self-service Retail Value Chain**

Self-service retail operators distribute food and drink products to consumers through their PoS portfolio.
While consumers consume the products, self-service retail operators contract primarily with the facility
management functions of private entities (e.g. offices, factories) and infrastructure functions of public entities
(e.g. rail stations, airports). Through contractual agreements, customers compensate the self-service retail
operators for providing a full or partial service. The value chain for the self-service retail industry includes
several key participants and areas:

**Machine manufacturing and consumables**

**End consumer** **production**

Employees, students, commuters, Machine or automated coffee
passengers, etc. machine manufacturing, as well as

snack / beverage / coffee
production (roaster)

**Financing and provision of**

**B2B contractors** **machines**

Private entities (at Buying, owning and leasing /
workplace), and selling machine portfolio,
infrastructure functions of installation at site and
public entities, e.g. rail technical service / repair
stations, airports
(on-the-go)

**Restocking and hygiene services** **Product supply**

Restocking of products, Provision of Products, including
cleaning and maintenance coffee, snacks and cold beverages,

as well as ware housing and logistics

Our offering spans sourcing and roasting of coffee, provision of self-service PoS, product supply and
restocking, and hygiene services.

Our operations span across the value chain of the Unattended SSR Market. We purchase machines for our
customers, install them at their premises and manage sourcing and stocking of the food and beverages on behalf
of our customers. We provide quality coffee brands and convenient food and beverage concepts, including
premium coffee concepts through our own brand Pelican Rouge and our Starbucks and Lavazza partnerships. We
also offer cleaning, maintenance and technical support services, which can be customized to individual
customers’ preferences. In addition to our self-service retail operations, we sell machines, machine parts and
products independently of service arrangements.

**Overview of Self-service Retail Business Models**

Business models can be differentiated depending on the level of services provided. Additionally, some selfservice retail operators offer the sale of ingredients (such as coffee beans, ground coffee, milk (powder) and
sugar), machines and machine parts as well as technical services. The provided level of service typically varies
with PoS density which determines profitability levels. The workplace segment with larger companies (with
more than 250 employees) typically provides for large scale full-service contracts. Self-operated PoS are
typically prevalent in smaller companies (with 250 or fewer employees) in the workplace segment, as well as at
gas stations in the on-the-go segment that are too remote to be fully operated by a self-service retail operator. The
detailed overview of business models is as follows:

**Full Service Model** The self-service retail operator owns or leases and is responsible for the
procurement and placement of PoS, stocking and restocking of items, and ongoing
maintenance.
The self-service retail operator pays a fee (e.g. based on sold cups, or a flat fee) to
the B2B contractor.
End consumers typically pay for convenience food and beverage at the PoS, with
sales directly collected from the self-service retail operator on a consumption
basis.
**Partial Service Model** The self-service retail operator provides the PoS and ingredients and receives a
monthly fee, with customers responsible for cleaning and refilling the PoS
themselves.
**Supply/Technical Model** The self-service retail operator sells machines (both replacements and to new
customers) and ingredients to customers without any service element and offers
technical service contracts for machines.

As these business models all require self-service retail operators to make regular visits to customer sites,
maintaining dense clusters of customers in conjunction with dynamic route-planning for merchandizers and
technicians visiting those sites are key for profitability. Telemetry devices installed in PoS provide self-service
retail operators with real-time data from the PoS, which is then used to plan bespoke routes to PoS that require a
visit, ensure no stock-outs and reduce time needed for merchandisers as with telemetry they already have
pre-kitted sets.

We operate across all three types of business models described above with a focus on the full service model,
which together with the partial service model accounted for 84% of our revenue for the year ended September 30,
2018, and the supply/technical model accounted for the remaining 16%.

Self-service retail services are typically provided to private, public and semi-public customers. Private
customers generally operate within private or relatively restricted locations such as offices and factories. Public
customers have properties that are generally located in more widely accessible locations such as railway stations,
and airports. PoS are also provided to customers in semi-public locations such as universities, schools, health
clubs, and hospitals.

We focus on three types of PoS: (i) hot beverages (predominantly coffee, hot chocolate, tea) free standing
PoS and table top machines; (ii) cold beverages (cans and bottles) in closed front PoS; and (iii) snacks, cold
drinks, fresh foods and non-food products in glass front PoS.

While all of these products are available through several other distribution channels (e.g. supermarkets,
coffee shops), PoS offer a value proposition focused around convenience for both consumers and customers at
locations where other distribution channels might not be available. Specifically, we provide consumers with
“24/7” access to products at particularly convenient points of sale in private, public and semi-public locations.
Furthermore, in the workplace segment we also operate MicroMarkets with an enlarged product portfolio on a
much larger area which provide us with an additional route to market which is gaining traction across Europe.

Self-service retail operators such as Selecta typically earn revenue from their customers via long-term
contracts which provide a high degree of revenue visibility due to stable consumption patterns of consumers.
While the term of each contract varies, private contracts are typically for a period of three to five years, and
public contracts are typically for a period of five to ten years. Self-service retail operators generate revenue based
on their specific business models and the range of services offered. Illustratively, a self-service retail provider
operating within a private setting with a full service business model would earn revenues from the sale of
products with prices agreed at the outset of the contract and adjusted based on a mechanism such as a price index.

99


-----

Operators generally also generate fixed service/maintenance fees from their public and private customers.
Volume-based rebates are typically agreed with larger multi-site customers. PoS in private settings operate either
on a free vend or pay vend basis. On a free vend basis, the customer subsidizes the cost for consumers which then
do not need to make payments themselves. Alternatively, on a pay vend basis, consumers purchase items using
cash or a form of cashless payment system without any subsidies from the customer. Products are sold in public
settings on a pay vend basis and providers are typically free to set and adapt product selling prices, but a provider
typically pays a fee (rent) to the customer for occupying the customer’s premises.

**Industry Drivers and Trends**

**_Consumer Trends Driving Growth_**

We operate in a market where future growth is fueled by positive underlying mega trends such as increasing
share of out-of-home food and beverage consumption, premiumization, and convenience. We also benefit from
overall GDP growth, although lower than our own market growth.

_Macroeconomic conditions: Selecta benefits from the supportive macro-economic conditions driving_
consumer spending growth, particularly out-of-home Food & Beverages. Furthermore, the increase in workforce
and hours-spend-at-work is driving overall consumption at the workplace.

_Premiumization: The premium coffee growth in coffee on-the-go and at the workplace drives pricing above_
inflation. Additionally, the shift towards healthy products supports higher prices in snacks and cold drinks.

_Shift toward convenience: As consumers desire convenience, we are poised to benefit from preferences for_
fast and local consumption. With an increasing focus on mobility, consumers prefer convenience formats while
spending more time and money on-the-go.

**_Industry Trends_**

We believe that the key drivers and trends impacting market growth in the Unattended SSR Market include
the following:

_Increased Workforce and Hours Spent In the Office_

The workplace segment is supported by growth in employment statistics, with all but one of the following
countries seeing an increase in total workforce numbers between 2012 and 2017: France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (the “Focus Countries”). Specifically, according
to OC&C, total workforce has grown at a CAGR of 1.4% in Sweden, 1.4% in the UK and 1.3% in France, Spain,
and Switzerland between 2012 and 2017. Collectively across all Focus Countries, the number of hours spent at
the office has grown at a CAGR of 0.9% between 2012 and 2017.

_Time Spent On-the-Go_

Due to overall mobility trends (rise in number of business and leisure commuters), consumers spend more
time (and money) on-the-go and prefer formats that offer desired products and quality fast (e.g. no lines, easy
payment options). The rise in domestic trips per capita is leading to increased number of encounters with PoS
and stores selling convenience products at public locations, increasing the demand for on-the-go convenience
products. Across all product categories and countries, surveys indicate that consumers on-the-go value the quick
transaction nature and convenient location of self-service retail vis-à-vis other retailing formats.

_Increased Consumer Spend on Out-of-Home Food and Beverage_

Out-of-home consumer spending on food and beverage items has been rising across each of the Focus
Countries. Between 2012 and 2014, out-of-home consumer spending increased at a CAGR of 1.8%. This growth
has intensified between 2014 and 2017 to 4.2%, driven primarily by large increases across the Focus Countries.
OC&C estimates that this spending growth will continue between 2018 and 2022. Increases in impulse
purchases, in particular from public points of sale have predominantly contributed to this growth.

_Available Locations_

Although the number of public locations has remained stable, there has been an increase in the number of
locations where operators can place self-service PoS, including offices. This increased availability also increases
consumer exposure to self-service retail points of sale, which drives growth in impulse purchases.

_Premiumization_

An increase in premium coffee drinking culture is driving on-the-go and workplace segment growth.
Furthermore, the premiumization trend (especially in coffee), in combination with a trend toward customized
products are driving average prices of premium food and beverages. Thus, increasing prices per vend and rising
share of premium coffee PoS underline the premiumization trend and consumers’ willingness to pay for it despite
the availability of free alternatives at work. The chart below illustrates the increase in the percentage of PoS
serving bean-to-cup coffee in each Focus Country.

Moreover, increasing health consciousness of consumers is driving the upscale and premium convenience
market, with categories such as cold drinks and snacks benefiting from consumers’ willingness to pay premium
prices for healthier options. The Addressable Market is expected to benefit from a growing demand for healthy

food and drinks, with the average expenditures for health and wellness food and beverage in France, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK, increasing by 4.2%, 3.8%, 3.9%, 2.4%, 3.3%,
1.6%, 1.9%, and 4.9%, respectively, from 2017 to 2022.

_Technology_

The introduction of cashless payments, telemetry, and special features is positively impacting the
Unattended SSR Market sales. The ongoing trend toward cashless payments is expected to drive further growth
in both on-the-go and workplace segments, catering to consumers’ need of “service speed” and convenience. The
share of cashless payments has grown across Europe and is expected to continue in the future.

Another technological trend positively impacting Unattended SSR Market sales is telemetry, which aids the
availability of location specific, high quality products (freshness of products, healthier options), catering to the
needs of consumers, and helps avoid stock-outs.

In addition, other technological advancements such as digital user interface are expected to further boost
Unattended SSR Market sales through attractive product presentation.

_Regulation_

The industry is also impacted by developments in regional, national and EU-wide regulation, for example
with regards to the display of ingredients, technical specifications of machines, ability to operate in certain
locations, recycling and waste disposal to name a few. It is our belief that larger operators such as the Group are
better positioned to understand, influence and react to such changes than smaller regional operators.

**_Focus Countries’ Addressable Markets_**

The Addressable Market in the Focus Countries is valued at approximately €42.4 billion (€40.5 billion
excluding capsules). Excluding capsules, for which there is limited historical data, the Addressable Market has
grown steadily at a CAGR of approximately 2.1% over 2012-2017 (1.4% over 2012-2014 and 2.6% over 20142017), which is driven by strong growth in foodservice, which grew at a CAGR of 4.2% over 2012-2014 and
5.4% over 2014-2017. Despite remaining flat over 2012-2014, the workplace segment grew at a CAGR of 2.7%
between 2014-2017. Going forward, we expect the Addressable Market in the Focus Countries to grow at a
CAGR of approximately 3.1% over 2017-2022, with both workplace and on-the-go segments growing at a
CAGR of 2.2% and 3.3%, respectively, over the same time period, on the back of secular favorable trends.

Evolving consumer preferences and positive macroeconomic trends have generally been driving growth in
the Addressable Market. New trends and economic conditions in most Focus Countries have contributed to
increased consumer spending particularly on out-of-home food and beverages, an overall increased workforce,
and increased average working hours. Consumer trends toward premium coffee experiences and premium
healthy cold drinks have also contributed to driving average prices for such products above the inflation rate.
Moreover, the continuing shift toward convenience in most markets and the overall increase in time spent in
transit (e.g. commuting, business trips) have contributed to expanding the Addressable Market.

The Unattended SSR Market in the Focus Countries, which is made up of on-the-go self-service retail,
workplace self-service retail, and capsules, is valued at approximately €15.3 billion (€13.4 billion excluding
capsules). Excluding capsules, for which there is limited historical data, the Unattended SSR Market has grown
at a CAGR of 1.6% over the period 2012-2017 (remaining relatively flat during 2012-2014 and growing at a
CAGR of 2.6% during 2014-2017). Following a return to growth between 2015 and 2017, largely due to
improvements in the European economy, the Unattended SSR Market is expected to grow at a rate of 2-3% per
year, with slightly higher growth in the on-the-go segment. The growth in the following years is expected to be
driven by an array of favorable trends. The following table illustrates the historical and projected growth for each
of the Focus Countries between 2014 and 2022.

**Drivers of Served Market Growth**

We are well positioned to take advantage of continued volume growth driven by an increase of hours spent
at work, time spent on-the-go, customer spend out-of-home food and beverage, technology, number of travelers,
and regulation. Additionally, as consumers shift toward more premium hot beverages and healthier cold drinks,
we will be able to take advantage of price increases that will ultimately drive margin expansion.

The Unattended SSR Market is expected to grow at 3.3% per annum for on-the-go and 2.3% per annum for
workplace between 2017-22. The Addressable Market is expected to grow at 3.1% per annum through 2022.
Overall, the Unattended SSR Market is expected to grow by 2-3% per annum. This represents considerable
upside potential just from a market growth perspective.

**Number one in Europe with Leading Market Positions Across Key Markets**

Selecta operates in a very fragmented market environment. In five out of the eight Focus Countries, we
claim the number one market position (Switzerland, Sweden, France, UK and Spain). We have a typical 10% to
15% market share in our core markets, while the remaining market is shared among a wide group of other
operators.

This fragmented market in Europe continues to present real opportunities for us, including through selective
acquisitions.

**_Market Fragmentation_**

The Unattended SSR Market is highly fragmented, with only 5 to 7 larger operators in each country, in
addition to over 200 to 1,000 highly localized operators. Therefore, we typically compete with local small
operators, and 4 to 6 larger operators in each country for large scale contracts. The chart below demonstrates the
number of self-service retail operators in each of the Focus Countries:

_2._ _Switzerland market includes adjustments for Dallmayr and Lyreco_

Given the large number of operators in the Unattended SSR Market, there are opportunities for
consolidation, especially for the top five operators in each Focus Country. Between 2015 and 2017, six of the
eight Focus Countries saw increased consolidation. In Sweden, for example, consolidation in the top five
operators between 2015 and 2017 increased by 5% due to acquisitions of the regional operators by the larger,
international operators.

**_Comprehensive Product & Service Offerings_**

We offer a wide variety of products, which range from coffee and hot drinks, cold drinks, snacks, to fresh
food. We have a diversified portfolio of attractive coffee brands across all price points. These include premium
global brands such as Starbucks and Lavazza, local specialties such as Pelican Rouge, and other third party
private labels.

Through these products, we have the ability to offer a suite of three main service capabilities: full service,
partial service, and supply/technical. Selecta’s full service includes a comprehensive package that includes
installations of Selecta PoS, regular filling and cleaning, and technical maintenance. Partial service targets
smaller office environments, and offers machines, ingredients, and consumables. Clients are responsible for
cleaning and refilling. In supply/technical, we provide the machines, ingredients and consumables. We offer
technical support services under separate contracts that are negotiated with the client. The machines are sold to
the customer in this case.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

Although there is no directly comparable competitor, we face competition from other similar traditional
self-service retail operators (both on a local / regional and national / international level), including those run by
contract caterers and facility management companies, fast-moving consumer goods, capsule, coffee bars, as well
as coffee tower companies and providers of alternative formats. Groups of key competitors in the Unattended
SSR Market are elaborated on below.

106


-----

_Traditional Self-service Retail Specialists_

Our main competitors are traditional self-service retail operators. The European Unattended SSR Market is
largely mature and is characterized by a large number of industry participants. The industry is fragmented with
few players of national scale and a long tail of small players per market, indicating the relatively low barriers to
entry at a local level but high barriers to scale. Self-service retail operators offer their services across workplace
and on-the-go segments. In the workplace segment, they focus on larger businesses (blue and white collar) with
high throughput and multiple PoS at one location given the high density required for efficiency in refilling. In the
on-the-go segment, self-service retail operators offer convenience products at locations where footfall for laborintensive formats is too low, retail space is insufficient, or opening hours limit other formats.

Given the high density required to operate PoS portfolio profitably, the Unattended SSR Market has
relatively high barriers to scale. There is a limited set of players comparable to us in terms of brand, scale,
product width and multi-regional presence. Regional specialists are competitive locally, but have a limited ability
to serve national/international customers (e.g. gas stations, public train stations) or offer a full product range. We
believe that the domestic key competitors in the Focus Countries include local players, such as IVS (mainly in
Italy), Daltys (only in France) and Maas (only in the Netherlands).

_Contract Caterers and Facility Management Providers_

Contract caterers and facility management providers can offer a one-stop service at a cost advantage, with
PoS typically being operated by a customer’s own cafeteria staff. However, complex machine operations
typically require trained technicians, leading to the credibility of caterers being increasingly questioned, e.g. in
terms of refilling fresh food and of costs and expenses. As a result, increasingly more, contract caterers and
facility management providers are partnering with self-service retail specialists to provide these services for a
fee. Key players include Aramark in Belgium and Germany, Compass in the UK and Elior in Spain.

_Vertically Integrated Self-service Retail Providers_

Vertically Integrated self-service retail providers represent a small group of mostly coffee and soft drinks
producers, who as an extension to their core drinks production operations also ventured into Unattended SSR
Market. However, they did so mostly as a brand extension and as a means of direct access and communication
with final consumers. As a result their product offering is usually limited or in some cases strictly restricted to
their own product portfolio (e.g. coffee or soft drinks). While they occupy a portion of the market, Vertically
Integrated self-service retail providers cannot fully compete as traditional self-service retail specialists, who
provide a considerably wider portfolio of brands, product offering and capabilities. Key players include JDE,
Dallmayr and Lavazza Professional (former Mars drinks). Coffee towers are also in this group and are operated
by coffee shop chains like Costa. Competitive pressures on traditional self-service retail specialists from coffee
towers is limited to urban areas. One of the key competitors is Costa Express in the United Kingdom (now part of
Coca-Cola, which is a competitor for our coffee offering in the UK, but we are still servicing their machines and
distributing their cold beverages in our PoS).

_Other Formats_

Other formats typically offer a wider range of food and beverages, including healthy and fresh options.
These formats typically require high footfall to be profitable and compensate for high fees. Compared to these
formats, self-service retail operators can maintain better proximity to consumers, in particular during short
changing times (e.g. train station platforms). Key competitors include Tesco Express, REWE to Go, 7-Eleven,
and Relay.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the leading route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider in Europe by
revenue with more than 475,000 PoS in 16 countries as of June 30, 2019, covering approximately 95% of
European GDP and approximately 78% of the European population. We held the number one or number two
market position based on revenue in 2017 in our ten core markets of Belgium, France, Finland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We served over ten million
consumers per day via more than 3,800 routes as of June 30, 2019. We operate in a highly fragmented market,
which provides growth opportunities, both organically and through accretive acquisitions. For the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019, we generated a revenue of €1,580.8 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €267.7 million,
and we would have generated an Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,604.7 million and an Adjusted EBITDA
(CS & CC) of €271.2 million, achieving 3.8% Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth compared to the twelve
months ended June 30, 2018, and 18.9% Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margins.

The following map illustrates the countries in which we operate, our geographical segments as of June 30,
2019, and our market positions in the Focus Countries (as defined below) for the year ended December 30, 2017.

_Source: OC&C. Market data as of 2017. Our market share in Italy consists of the 2017 market share of Argenta, which we acquired in_
_February 2018. Our market share in the UK consists of the 2017 market share of Selecta combined with (i) the 2017 market share of the UK_
_operations of Pelican Rouge, which we acquired in September 2017, and (ii) the 2017 market share of Express Vending, which we acquired in_
_August 2018._

Our diversified product offering includes both coffee and hot drinks, and we have entered into strong
partnerships with global premium coffee brands such as Starbucks and Lavazza, which allow us to benefit from
consumers’ increasing preference for premium products, especially coffee, and result in higher margins. We also
cater to the impulse-based consumer purchases with offerings of snacks, including healthy options, cold drinks
and fresh food sold through traditional impulse PoS as well as our recently introduced MicroMarkets concept.
For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) as a percentage of the types of
items we sell amounted to 56% for coffee and hot drinks, 29% for impulse items, and 15% for other.

We serve customers and generate revenue in the workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business
channels further discussed below:

(*) Adjusted Revenue (CS & CS) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019.

Our business model covers the full value chain of the coffee and convenience food Unattended SSR Market,
from green bean roasting to brewing to the consumer’s cup, and we have developed industry leading coffee
know-how, capabilities, and expertise in connection with these processes. We roast and produce both instant and
full bean coffee, which we use in our own PoS, our customers’ PoS and also sell to third parties, and as such, our
roaster in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, is an important driver of our coffee expertise. We have created a strong
portfolio of high-quality coffee brands, such as our in-house developed Pelican Rouge brand and its
craftsmanship image that caters for growing number of consumers increasingly looking for this attribute. Our
Pelican Rouge brand complements our premium coffee offering in partnership with Lavazza and Starbucks. We
leverage our technology capabilities and data collection from PoS to provide relevant products, gauge consumer
preferences and maximize revenue opportunities, which improve consumer experience and customer satisfaction.
We also provide cleaning, maintenance, and technical support services which can be customized based on
individual customer needs and preferences, even when we do not enter into a full self-service retail service
arrangement with the customer. In addition to our unattended self-service and coffee roasting operations, we also
sell coffee and machines, including to hotels, restaurants and cafés, and machine parts and products independent
of self-service retail service arrangements.

Due to the predictable nature of our business and the length of our customer contracts, we believe we are
able to achieve high revenue visibility. We benefit from diversified revenue streams secured by multi-year
contracts derived from a large and loyal customer base across private and public sector in 2018 and a 100%
retention rate with our top ten customers over that period. As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that our average
private customer contract term is three to five years, and our average public customer contract term is five to ten
years. Moreover, the maintenance and cleaning services we offer as part of our self-service retail services provide
us with an additional source of high margin revenues.

Innovation and technology are also key drivers of our success, and we benefit from our track record of
innovation leadership both in terms of technology upgrades such as cashless payment, touchscreen user
interfaces and telemetry, as well as in terms of unattended self-service retail concepts, such as MicroMarkets, to
drive daily revenue per PoS and open new routes-to-market.

Since our founding in Switzerland in 1957, we have grown organically as well as through acquisitions. On
September 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the Pelican Rouge Group, which increased our presence in
nine of the 15 markets in which we operated at that time, making us the market leader by revenue in France,
Spain, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. In addition, on February 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of the

109


-----

Argenta Group, a leading unattended self-service retail operator in Italy, which became our 16[th] market. On
August 17, 2018, we acquired Express Vending, a leading UK supplier of premium unattended self-service retail
services, bolstering our position as the leading European provider of route-based unattended self-service coffee
and impulse and convenience food offerings, including MicroMarkets, and further consolidated our leading
position in the United Kingdom. Express Vending is at the forefront of MicroMarket design and deployment in
the UK. Express Vending’s Express HUB brand stores, with open plan refreshment areas, an extensive product
range and self-scan kiosks.

As a result of these acquisitions, our innovation and technology leadership, and through upgrades of our
business, operating systems and corporate culture, we have achieved a leading position in Europe as a routebased unattended self-service retail provider with strong know-how and capabilities in providing coffee and
impulse offerings across a range of workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business channels. We had
average market shares ranging between 10% and 15% in our core markets for the year ended December 30, 2017,
compared to approximately 6% of the European market over the same period in 2016, and we served over ten
million consumers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 6 million for the year
ended September 30, 2016. We see significant opportunities for further organic growth and accretive
acquisition-led growth in our highly fragmented markets.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the key competitive strengths listed below.

**_Business Proposition Offering Unmatched Convenience_**

We offer consumers a wide variety of on-the-go food products for everyday consumption and impulse
purchases, with a strong focus on coffee, at all hours of the day and every day of the year thanks to our
unattended, 24/7, fully automated, convenience retail concept. Our concept targets captive environments and is
economically viable even in low footfall locations due to our minimal operational costs compared with
traditional retail concepts. Our ability to sell products in convenient retail locations and our high level of
customer service has led to an average overall customer retention based on revenue of approximately 95.9% for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and approximately 92.5% and 94.4% for each of the years ended
September 30, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We believe that the quality of our service levels and our customer
relationship management contribute to customer loyalty, leading to an average relationship of approximately 15
years with our 10 largest customers. In addition, contract renewals with our existing long-term customers are
typically more profitable than entering into a contract with a new customer, due to savings on equipment and
other capital expenditures and customer acquisition costs. Our costs associated with new customers are followed
by predictable revenue streams and we usually recoup these costs within two years. We have a scalable routebased business model that we are able to apply across the 16 countries in which we operate with the same key
success factors, to drive growth in customers, daily revenue per PoS and profitability. For example, following the
Argenta Acquisition in 2018, we have replicated Argenta’s MicroMarkets operating model in other countries
such as Switzerland and the Netherlands. Our focus on out-of-home impulse consumption limits our exposure to
competition from online retailers and offerings.

**_Well Positioned to Take Advantage of Premium Coffee and Out-of-Home Consumption Growth_**

We operate in our Addressable Market, estimated at €42 billion in 2017, in our Focus Countries. Within the
Addressable Market, we focus on the Unattended SSR Market which has a market size of approximately
€16 billion in our 16 countries of operations, of which approximately €15 billion arises in the Focus Countries.
Our Addressable Market has grown at a CAGR of 2.1% between 2012 and 2017, reaching a total value of
approximately €40.5 billion in the Focus Countries and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% reaching
€47.1 billion by 2022. This trend has been driven by a positive macro-economic backdrop with an increase in
GDP and stable employment levels, which have led to increased spending in the workplace channel. In addition,
we believe that an increasing preference for drinking premium coffee and out-of-home consumption, increased
mobility, and the desire for easy availability of healthy and quality products is driving consumers towards our
pan-European on-the-go self-service retail offerings. For example, sales of coffee within the Addressable Market
has grown at a CAGR of 2.8% between 2012 to 2017, reaching €16.0 billion, and is expected to grow at a CAGR
of 3.9%, reaching €19.4 billion by 2022.

Moreover, the growing trend toward premium brands has created a shift in consumer emphasis on high
quality product offerings, including organic and name-brand coffee, a trend which we are addressing with our

110


-----

Starbucks, and Lavazza brand partnerships. For example, we are able to offer consumers a premium hot drinks
experience, both in the workplace and on-the-go through our long-standing partnership with Starbucks. As of
June 30, 2019, we have installed approximately 1,964 Starbucks concepts across Europe, and the price of a
coffee sold in our Starbucks on-the-go concept is between 20% to 90% higher than a coffee sold in traditional
self-service PoS, and such trends for premium brands support our profitability. Similarly, through our partnership
with Lavazza we offer our customers and consumers additional options for a premium coffee experience. As of
June 30, 2019, we had over 15,637 PoS selling Lavazza coffee and we estimate that approximately 40,000 PoS
will serve Lavazza coffee in the long-term.

**_Leading Unattended Self-Service Coffee and Convenience Food Provider in the European Unattended SSR_**
**_Market with Growth above Market_**

We are the leading route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider in the
Unattended SSR Market, and had an estimated 10% market share by revenue in the Focus Countries for the year
ended December 30, 2017, compared to 6% over the same period in 2016. We believe that our adjusted revenue
(on a constant scope and constant currency basis) for the year ended September 30, 2018, was approximately 3.5
times that of the second largest market player. As of June 30, 2019, we had operations in 16 European countries,
which covered approximately 95% of European GDP and contain approximately 78% of the European
population. In 2016, we served over six million consumers per day, which we have nearly doubled to more than
ten million consumers served per day. We held the number one or number two market position based on revenue
in 2017 in our ten core markets, and we estimate that this market data is still accurate as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum. Our sales in these markets represented 90.7% of our revenue for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, we operated a network of more than 475,000 active coffee and
convenience food and beverage self-service PoS, approximately 2.5 times the number of PoS of the second
largest market player. With regards to our suppliers, we believe we are the largest machine buyer in the highly
fragmented Unattended SSR Market, making us the customer of choice for our suppliers, which in turn provides
us with competitively priced procurement arrangements on, amongst other, a wide selection of market leading
machines.

The Unattended SSR Market is characterized by fragmentation and intense competition on a local level. We
are one of the very few operators on a pan-European level, which increases the appeal of our brands and
offerings with consumers and of our services and concepts with customers, as compared with our smaller
competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in each of our three
geographic segments was split relatively evenly with Central accounting for 37%, North accounting for 26%, and
South, UK & Ireland accounting for 37%. This is in contrast to the second largest market player, over three
quarters of whose revenue in its last financial year was derived from Italy alone. In addition, the breadth of our
product portfolio enables us to better address consumers’ preferences across geographic segments, including
evolving market trends, and to provide a one-stop shop offering for our customers. Additionally, our established
brands and unique concepts differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to secure attractive and
comprehensive contracts with a variety of suppliers and premium brands, which help us maintain our high
market share.

**_Using Innovation and Technology to Drive Growth and Improve Margins_**

We use innovation and new technologies to drive our growth and improve margins, and we have a track
record of innovation leadership through continuous rollouts of upgrades to our PoS across all geographies.
Innovation and technology improve the consumer experience, enhance operational excellence and allow us to
further expand our route-based business model. Cashless payment systems and digital touchscreen user interfaces
that we are rolling out across our PoS park enhance the consumer experience by providing additional
accessibility and simplicity of use, thereby driving number of sales and average transaction size compared to
cash transactions. As of June 30, 2019, daily revenue per PoS equipped with cashless technology are on average
10% to 20% higher than PoS that only accept cash, and the average transaction value of products sold from
cashless PoS is between 5% to 10% higher, making cashless payment options an important driver in increasing
sales from existing PoS. As of June 30, 2019, 95% of our public PoS deployed cashless technology. Telemetry in
our PoS allows us to better adjust our pricing and product offerings to drive sales and to more efficiently monitor
inventory levels and determine maintenance requirements, which increases our route efficiency and operational
excellence, and thereby improves service quality and customer retention. As of June 30, 2019, we had telemetry
devices installed in approximately 95% of our public PoS. In addition to technological innovation, we also
continue to innovate and introduce new unattended self-service retail concepts, such as MicroMarkets, to adapt to
market and consumer trends, increase sales and improve profitability, while reducing capital expenditures.

**_Route-Based Business Model with High Density on the Last Mile_**

Our route-based business model combined with our size represents a distinct competitive advantage,
particularly on the last mile of service, which allows us to service and supply PoS at an optimized cost level,
thereby improving our profitability compared to other competitors. In addition, we continuously optimize the
density of our PoS to make routes more efficient, thereby reducing driving time and increasing our ability to
service more PoS per hour and more PoS per FTE. We are, therefore, able to offer more competitive pricing at
the same profitability point or the same levels of service at a lower price, as compared to less profitable smaller
regional players, thereby creating genuine barriers to match our scale. We also use data from our PoS equipped
with telemetry and our dedicated team of approximately 150 planners (as of June 30, 2019) to continuously
optimize our over 3,800 dense and cost-effective routes. As of June 30, 2019, our 4,900 route merchandizers and
1,400 route technicians were able to service their routes using a fleet of over 5,000 vehicles. The map below
illustrates the location of each of our PoS, and shows the density of our route-based networks.

**_Scale Driven Business Model Creating Attractive Economics and Enhancing Established Market Presence_**

We have developed a business model with a cost advantage through economies of scale and high density,
and we believe it will be difficult for potential competitors to replicate the scale, breadth, and efficiency of our
organization. Our scale also enables us to deliver superior customer service by leveraging our knowledge of the
industry to provide customers and consumers with a comprehensive range of products and innovative service
offerings. These attributes lead to an estimated 5% to 15% EBITDA margin (as defined by and according to
OC&C) advantage over smaller competitors.

We deploy capital expenditures in order to retain and acquire new customers and do so by acquiring new
PoS and refurbishing our existing PoS in order to enhance returns on investment. Capital expenditure for new
PoS and refurbishment of existing PoS of the Group typically achieves a ROI ranging from 100% to 250%,
depending on the country, with the highest returns in the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland. We have
consistently achieved efficiencies stemming from PoS park rationalization (which includes margin management,
relocating PoS to more profitable locations, and decreasing the types of PoS in use) and refurbishment. In
addition to the operational advantages explained above we also believe that given our scale we retain a cost
advantage over our competitors in terms of pricing from machine suppliers and that our in-house refurbishment
and maintenance capabilities also provide us a cost advantage.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Organic Growth, Profitability and Cash Conversion Momentum_**

Our business has delivered consistent financial results with resilient Adjusted EBITDA margins and stable
cash flow generation, with a non-IFRS cash conversion (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) minus
Adjusted Net Capital Expenditures (CS & CC), divided by Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC)) of 46.7%, 45.9%, and
52.0% for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, and 49.1% for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA minus net capital expenditures, divided by Adjusted EBITDA,
amounted to 38.2%, 42.5% and 50.8% for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and

112


-----

49.0% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Following the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta
Acquisition, and the Express Vending Acquisition, we have also benefited from significant cost synergies
including, among others, procurement savings, footprint optimization, headquarters integration, and price
harmonization and streamlining. As we continue to realize synergies, our efficiency improves and cash
conversion continues on a positive trend.

Our strong market positions in key markets, coupled with our ongoing efforts to optimize PoS density and
operational efficiencies, increased technology penetration, as well as data analytics across all markets contribute
to further enhancing our financial profile and organic growth. Excluding France and the UK, we achieved
revenue growth of 4.3% for the year ended September 30, 2018, compared to the year ended September 30, 2017,
and 5.2% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, while
achieving organic revenue growth at constant scope and constant currency (as further described under
“Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”) of 3.4% and 2.7% during the same respective
periods. Additionally, through our continued efforts to install new and upgrade existing PoS as well as optimize
our product offering, we have seen a growth of 1.4% in our daily revenue per PoS in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.

**_Experienced Executive Management Team with Proven Execution Track Record_**

We have a long and successful track record of attracting and retaining top talent and have continued to
invest in a high quality management team in order to most effectively manage our existing operations and
execute our strategies. Our senior management team is led by our CEO, David Flochel, Chairman, David Hamill,
CFO, Gabriel Pirona, and COO, Pascal Uffer, who have more than 80 years of combined experience and
leadership track record with international companies. The senior management team has a strong focus on
functional expertise and is complemented by local management teams with regional focus. Over the past three
years, the team has successfully led the roll-out of our innovative Starbucks on-the-go concepts, the
implementation of our profitable partnership with Lavazza, as well as our MicroMarkets concept, and have
successfully progressed the roll-out of new technologies for our PoS across our geographic markets and the
integration of the Pelican Rouge and Gruppo Argenta acquisitions. We believe that the collective industry
knowledge and leadership of our senior management team will enable them to continue to grow our business and
execute our strategies.

**Our Strategies**

**_Key Pillars Driving Our Strategy_**

We intend to continue to nurture our strong reputation with our customers and consumers and to deliver
consistently superior financial results, in line with our ultimate goal of achieving a culture of excellence. This
excellence stems from a driven and successful team combined with a clear, strategic, and consistent framework,
according to which we take decisions and run our business. We have identified the following key pillars driving
our strategy, as further described below.

**_Driving Performance Through Sales Excellence_**

The first line for growing our business and improving our margins is excellence in sales, as it is through
sales that we increase our pipeline of potential new contracts, increase our new contract gains and maintain our
high level of customer retention. Sales excellence is the key driver of our organic growth, and over the last two
years we committed a substantial portion of our resources to improving our salesforce effectiveness and further
strengthening our relationship with our customers. We focus on performance-led management and increased
activity dedicated to new business sales teams and account managers. As part of this initiative, we are engaging
in training, coaching on the job and concept selling to enhance the capabilities of our sales force and to lead the
execution of our strategies. The tables below show our new contract pipeline, increase in new gains and customer
retention since 2017:

**_Further Developing Pricing and Category Management_**

We believe that there is a significant opportunity to increase daily revenue per PoS by improving pricing
and category management. We have initiated an analytical approach to support decision making and assess the
impact of pricing and category management across our footprint. With telemetry now equipped on most of our
public PoS, it allows us to analyze sales data and unlock pricing capabilities in ways previously unavailable to us.
We believe this gives us an opportunity to continuously optimize performance, with location specific product
assortment and pricing initiatives, allowing us to better manage margins on underperforming accounts, upsell our
services to B2B customers, and reduce leakage to competing local offerings. We expect pricing and category
management efforts to have a more than €10.0 million impact on revenue for our 2019 fiscal year.

**_Improving Operational Excellence_**

Our route-based business model benefits from the significant increases in productivity resulting from our
dense network of PoS and depots, and we are continuously optimizing route density through professional route
planning. We thereby leverage our focus on technology and innovation to further improve our operational
excellence. For example, the installation of telemetry capabilities in our PoS allows for dynamic route planning
and increased efficiency of our refillers by reducing preparation time and enabling the refiller to visit more PoS.
Density optimization is also a key consideration in our bolt-on acquisition program, and one of the key drivers of
synergy achievement.

Our operational excellence is also driven by our success in acquiring and integrating companies, such as
Pelican Rouge, Argenta and Express Vending. Led by an integration office reporting to the Board of Directors of
the Group, we have identified approximately €75 million in annualized procurement, SG&A and operational
synergies that are at being implemented and that we expect to be fully realized by the end of 2020, resulting in a
strong margin uplift. In terms of procurement, we expect to achieve up to €30 million of annualized synergies
from equipment, ingredients, bought-in goods, disposables, packaging and spares and the in-sourcing of coffee
production. SG&A synergies in an amount of up to €13 million include the consolidation of country and group
headquarters and the optimization of overhead and corporate costs. We expect to achieve up to €33 million of
operational synergies from the transfer of best practices within our group and from an increase in density as a
result of depot, merchandizer and technician network optimization and increase in utilization of telemetry
capabilities, which drives route efficiency for our refillers.

**_Continued Roll Out and Focus on Our Technology and Innovation Capabilities_**

We deem technology and innovation to be a competitive differentiator for our current operations and
business going forward. We continue to commit resources and make the necessary investments to be at the
forefront of technology and innovation in our industry. Currently, we are managing three footprint-wide key
enablers that contribute to an improvement in daily revenue per PoS and operational efficiency. Firstly, we are
expanding and upgrading our current PoS base with telemetry technology, a remote PoS monitoring allowing for
optimization of cost-to-serve and product availability while leading the transformation toward an end-to-end
operating model. Approximately 29% of our eligible PoS park has already been upgraded as of June 30, 2019,
while we aim to roll-out telemetry to all eligible PoS across the footprint. Secondly, we are also upgrading our
PoS to support cashless technology to enhance check-out experience at the point of sale by providing access to
non-cash payment methods, i.e. credit cards and proprietary apps. Approximately 20% of our eligible PoS park
has already been upgraded as of June 30, 2019. Thirdly, our MicroMarket concept allows us to introduce an
innovative, unique, and attractive format bringing together technology, brands, and operational capabilities while
combining the classic vending model (convenience) with the cafeteria model (premium and healthy). While the
concept is already established in the UK, Italy, Switzerland and, recently, the Netherlands, we plan to roll-out the
format across our other markets to further expand our current footprint of 104 MicroMarkets as of June 30, 2019.
For example, we have launched our MicroMarket concept in Spain, where we have already entered into
agreements to install MicroMarkets, and in Germany, where we have started discussions with potential
customers.

**_Pursuing Growth Through a Disciplined Capital Expenditure Program_**

We intend to continue to pursue growth through a disciplined capital expenditure program that provides an
attractive return on investment period, while also optimizing the capital intensity of our operations. We have a
structured and consistent governance with respect to capital expenditures across our group, with pre-investments
business cases and post-investment appraisals and tracking of outcomes. At the same time, we are working to

114


-----

optimize the capital intensity of our operations by refurbishing existing PoS to increase their life and maximizing
our refurbishment capabilities and re-siting underperforming PoS. We also intend to continue exploring
off-balance sheet funding options, such as our alternative arrangements with Lavazza and other leasing
companies, to finance PoS investments for our customers, thereby reducing our initial investment cost for new
client contracts. Innovative route-based solutions such as MicroMarkets also have lower capital expenditure
requirements than classic impulse purchase offerings, while generating two to three times the revenue of a classic
self-service retail site, with each MicroMarket generating an approximate turnover of €50,000 annually. Through
these and other initiatives, we intend to reduce our PoS related cash capital expenditures to under €100.0 million
per year.

**_Engaging in Bolt-On Acquisition Opportunities in Our Fragmented Industry_**

Our reference markets present a fragmented structure with significant bolt-on M&A opportunities, which
would allow us to further strengthen our position as the leading unattended self-service coffee and convenience
food provider in Europe. Given our scale and market knowledge, we continue to see ourselves as a natural
market consolidator. We intend to continue to selectively undertake accretive bolt-on acquisition opportunities to
continue our growth, improve our density and improve our technical as well as service capabilities. The
Unattended SSR Market is characterized by a large number of operators, which on average tend to be very small
in terms of revenue. The following table shows the competitor fragmentation in certain of our key markets:

**Number of** **Average Size of**
**Vending Operators** **Tail [(1)]**

**_€m_**

**~100–150** **5.7**

**~200–250** **0.7**

**~1000–1200** **1.7**

**600–700** **2.2**

**~3,000** **0.4**

**~100-200** **3.5**

**1,600–1,900** **0.6**

**1,000–1,500** **2.1**

(1) Average size of tail refers to the average size of our competitors.

This fragmentation, and our position as the leader in the Unattended SSR Market, provide us with a large
number of bolt-on acquisition opportunities. We have completed five bolt-on acquisitions over the past two
years. Each acquisition we make is underpinned by a clear strategy, whether it be to increase density in existing
regions, develop market shares, expand our portfolio of offerings, improve technical capabilities in specialized
services or some combination of the foregoing. We aim to purchase companies at mid-single-digit EV/EBITDA
multiples, and to extract at least a turn of synergies from those acquisitions. Underpinning our success in bolt-on
acquisitions is a disciplined execution and integration program that has been proven through our track record of
identifying, purchasing at attractive multiples and successfully integrating these bolt-on acquisition opportunities.

**_Developing Our People_**

Our people underlie our success, and we believe that our employees are an integral part in successfully
executing our strategies. To that end, we are undertaking initiatives related to performance management, sales
and operational capabilities, employee engagement and employer branding to ensure we maximize the potential
of our talent across our organization. Included among these initiatives are talent reviews of all teams to provide
improved management of the talent pools within each of our markets. We have developed a sales and operations
academy in order to train and develop our team with the right programs to drive customer satisfaction and
efficiencies. We have also worked to improve our employee on-boarding and performance management for our
field force, with a focus on developing first-line manager capabilities. In terms of employee engagement, we
have created a baseline employee survey in partnership with GALLUP, and plan to implement a tailored action

115


-----

plan based on the survey results for each team. We are also focused on improving our internal communication
strategy, with improvement of our intranet, implementation of a new ethics program and the publishing of our
first CSR report. We believe that continued implementation of these initiatives, and a focus on the continued
development of our people, will support the execution of our strategies.

**Our History**

Since our founding in Switzerland in 1957, we have grown both organically as well as through acquisitions.
Following our first acquisition in Switzerland in 1959, we expanded into Germany in 1986, Sweden and France
in 1990, Austria, Slovakia and the Baltic countries in 1995, Belgium in 1997, Spain in 1998, the United Kingdom
and Ireland in 2001 and the Netherlands in 2004. In 1985, we were acquired by the Valora group, and, in 1997,
we listed on the SIX before de-listing in 2001. In 2001, we were acquired by the Compass group before
becoming part of Allianz Capital Partners through its acquisition of our business in 2007. We were acquired by
KKR in 2015.

In September 2017, we acquired the Pelican Rouge Group, previously known as Autobar Group Ltd, a
company incorporated in London in 1925, which engages in roasting and blending, packaging, and self-service
retail of coffee in the United Kingdom and internationally. In 2014, Autobar Group changed its name to Pelican
Rouge and relocated to Dordrecht, the Netherlands. The coffee brand Pelican Rouge (Roode Pelikaan) was
originally founded in 1863 in Antwerp.

In February 2018, we acquired the Argenta Group. Since its founding in Carpi, Modena, Italy in 1968, the
Argenta Group has grown organically as well as through acquisitions to become the second largest food and
beverage self-service retail operator in the Italian market. In 2016, the Argenta Group expanded into southern
Italy through the acquisition of Somed, and into the food retail business under the Foodie’s brand and through
agreements with 365 Retail Market with its MicroMarket concept.

In August 2018, we acquired Express Vending, a leading UK supplier of premium self-service retail
services with a focus on London and its neighboring counties. Express Vending’s offering of products and
services includes table top coffee machines and MicroMarkets. Express Vending was established in 1992 and is
headquartered in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, Great Britain. We also made three smaller acquisitions in
Italy in 2018.

**Our Business**

**_Overview of our Route-Based Operations_**

We are the leading route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider Europe by
revenue. We cover more than 3,800 routes reaching over ten million consumers with more than 475,000 PoS in
16 countries. As of June 30, 2019, our logistics set up was supported by approximately 150 planners, 4,900 route
merchandizers, 1,400 route technicians and a fleet of over 5,000 vehicles. We pro-actively plan routes for our
merchandizers based on PoS consumption, capacity and other specific requirements, such as hygiene or customer
commitments. Our planning teams organize these visits by static route-planning with routes planned four to eight
weeks in advance based on historic consumption and internal tools, and by dynamic route-planning with daily
plans generated based on real-time data and forecasts collected from PoS through telemetry. We plan routes for
our technicians when one of our PoS experience a breakdown and, to a lesser extent, pro-actively to prevent any
issues.

Our operations span across the value chain of the self-service coffee and convenience food markets. We
purchase machines for our customers, or procure third party financing for our customers to purchase machines,
install them at their premises and manage the sourcing and stocking of the food and beverages on behalf of our
customers. We provide quality coffee brands and convenient food and beverage concepts, including premium
coffee concepts through our Starbucks and Lavazza partnerships. We also offer cleaning, maintenance and
technical support services, which can be customized to individual customers’ preferences. In addition to our selfservice retail operations, we sell self-service retail machines, machine parts and products independently of
service arrangements. We operate our PoS network under the “Selecta” brand across all our markets, except in
Italy where we use the “Argenta” brand and in Finland where we use the “Pelican Rouge” brand. We believe our
brands enjoy strong brand recognition in many of the markets in which we operate and stand for quality and
innovation.

**_Our Business Channels_**

Our self-service business serves consumers in the following business channels:

   - The workplace channel, which is comprised of (i) private self-service retail, consisting of PoS placed
and serviced in various private locations, such as large corporate customers, in various businesses and
industries and including in corporate offices, manufacturing and logistics sites and (ii) OCS, which is
comprised of table-top coffee machines rented out to corporate customers for office use along with the
provision of technical services and coffee and related supplies for the PoS. OCS is targeted primarily at
small and medium-sized enterprises.

   - The on-the-go channel, which is comprised of PoS placed and serviced in semi-public areas, or public
areas following a successful bidding process with relevant government authorities to place our PoS in a
given location. The types of public locations include train stations, airports and gas stations. The types
of semi-public locations include hospitals, universities and entertainment venues. The bidding process
by which we obtain our public contracts is long and contentious, and subject to many local laws and
ordinances. These contracts, however, are very lucrative to our business as these public spaces
experience high traffic during all hours in the day, including late nights when most other food and
beverage stores are closed for business. For example, we were able to grow our revenues in Germany
as a result of a public contract with Deutsche Bahn to place PoS throughout rail stations in the West
and South of Germany. Although the number of Selecta PoS used for public areas only represents 4%
of our PoS as of June 30, 2019, it accounts for 18% of our revenue for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019.

   - The trading channel, which is comprised of sales of machines and products, including coffee roasted in
our roasting facility, as well as the provision of technical and hygienic support to customers.

**_Our Geographic Segments_**

As of June 30, 2019, we had combined operations in 16 countries across Europe. For operational,
management and financial reporting purposes, we divide our operations into the following three geographic
segments:

   - _South, UK & Ireland includes operating entities in Ireland, Italy, Spain and the UK;_

   - _Central includes operating entities in Austria, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland; and_

   - _North includes operating entities in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,_
Norway, and Sweden. As of October 1, 2017, one operating in Finland was classified as held for sale
and excluded from this segment; it was subsequently sold in March 2018.

**Our Products**

We provide customers with a range of mainstream to premium coffee and a variety of convenience food and
beverage products, including hot drinks, snacks, cold beverages, and filtered water, through a variety of table-top
coffee machines or free-standing PoS, coffee, cold beverages and snacks PoS and water dispensers. We also sell
coffee from our roasting facility, machines for hotels, restaurants and cafés (“HoReCa”), and machines directly
to customers or third parties independently of any services arrangements. Furthermore, through a partnership
agreement with 365 Retail, we operate MicroMarkets in Italy.

**_Hot Drinks Sold Through Our PoS_**

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, 56% of our revenue was generated by our variety of table top
and free-standing hot drink self-service PoS, with instant, roasted whole bean and ground coffee options,
professional espresso machines, and roasted coffee beans. These machines serve a wide variety of coffee and
coffee specialty drinks as well as freshly brewed tea, hot chocolate and soups. In 2009, we introduced our own
brand coffee blends under the Miofino brand to complement our range of hot drink self-service PoS. Following
the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, we have increased our range of own brand coffee offerings under the name
Pelican Rouge. Both Pelican Rouge and Miofino coffee offerings include mild, medium, and bold blends as well
as decaffeinated and organic and fair trade-certified blends, including instant, roasted whole bean and ground
coffee options. Specific Pelican Rouge and Miofino coffee blend availability varies according to country.

Table top machines are primarily targeted at the private self-service retail segment, such as offices, but are
also frequently located in restaurants and cafés and in certain specific public locations such as gas stations. Free
117


-----

standing PoS, in contrast, are primarily suited for public locations in high-traffic areas such as airports and train
and subway stations. We offer table top and free-standing models on either free vend basis, where the customer
covers the cost of the products and users do not need to pay at the PoS, or pay vend basis, where consumers
purchase items using coins or a form of cashless payment systems. See “—Payment Options.” Our wide selection
of hot drink self-service PoS allows customers to select the right machine for their needs based on additional
factors, such as cup capacity and the number of available drink selections. For example, our Ferrara coffee selfservice machine has capacity for 100 cups per day, can vend a variety of coffee specialties, in addition to freshly
brewed tea and hot chocolate. It also features an integrated color touch screen that allows users to select and
customize their drinks by adding sugar or increasing or decreasing the strength of drinks to taste, and nutritional
and allergy information is available via the touch screen to help consumers make informed choices.

In addition, we provide a range of premium hot drink self-service PoS through the following partnerships:

   - _Starbucks: We introduced Starbucks on-the-go PoS for public spaces in_
2013. These PoS feature premium coffee self-service machines
manufactured by Franke that include space for two types of coffee beans,
offer a wide variety of coffee specialty drinks and allow users to choose
from three drink sizes depending on the beverage selection. Additionally,
flexible payment options are available and each PoS can be configured
with a payment module. On January 12, 2015, we entered into a partnership
with Starbucks governed by an exclusive contract and, in August 2018, we signed a new agreement
with Starbucks. This agreement is valid until July 2021 and provides us with the license to develop and
operate Starbucks premium self-serve solutions, including Starbucks on-the-go for public and
semi-public channels and Starbucks workplace for private channels, in 13 markets in Europe. Under
this agreement, we market, sell and operate the concepts while Starbucks provides all the ingredients,
taking into account a profit element. We earn the revenue and the profit through the sale of the products
and applicable maintenance and service charges. For the year ended September 30, 2018, sales from
Starbucks concepts accounted for €61.6 million of our revenue, which was a 7.9% increase compared
to the same period in 2017. We installed 168 additional Starbucks concepts in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019, and, as of June 30, 2019, we had over 1,964 Starbucks concepts in 11 countries,
increasing from 1,151, 1,490 and 1,796 PoS as of September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.

   - _Lavazza: We introduced our range of Lavazza self-service PoS in 2017 for_
private and public customers. Lavazza PoS can be ordered for an array of
spaces from small or large offices to gas stations and major public
transportation hubs. Our partnership with Lavazza is governed by a
framework contract that we entered into on December 22, 2016, with an
indefinite term set to expire 60 days from the expiry of the last lease
agreement under such framework agreement. Under this framework
agreement, we derive our revenue from (i) sales of products used in connection with leased self-service
PoS owned by Lavazza and (ii) sales of Lavazza coffee from our PoS. We installed 3,654 new Lavazza
PoS selling Lavazza coffee in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and, as of June 30, 2019, we
operated over 15,637 PoS selling Lavazza coffee across eight countries. In the long-term, we plan on
installing approximately 40,000 PoS throughout our markets. Our range of Lavazza PoS can be
combined with our full ranges of services and we have launched our telesales of Lavazza coffee
capsules for table-top machines in eight countries. Lavazza telesales are conducted from our call
centers, and generally target offices where table-top machines that use Lavazza coffee capsules may be
operated. See “—Machines, Machine Parts and Products.” We also enter into alternative lease
arrangements with Lavazza whereby Lavazza directly buys the machine, and we receive the revenue
generated by such PoS less a commission withheld by Lavazza. For the year ended September 30,
2018, sales from Lavazza PoS accounted for €61.1 million of our revenue, which was a 200% increase
compared to the same period in 2017.

**_Roasted Coffee Produced by Our Roasting Facility_**

We operate a roasting facility in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, from which we supply the Group and third
parties, such as wholesale businesses, other self-service retailers, and industrial customers in over 65 countries,
with coffee. While the primary focus of the facility is producing roasted whole bean and ground coffee, which
accounted for 44% of our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2018, it also mixes
instant coffee products, in each case under the Pelican Rouge brand, which accounted for 56% of our Adjusted

118


-----

Revenue (CS & CC) over the same period. Within the capsule, roasted whole bean, ground and instant coffee
categories, customers may choose among a wide selection of arabica or robusta, and caffeinated or decaf roasts
of varying strengths, some of which are certified organic. The typical customers for these products include retail
and food self-service chains, hotels, restaurants, and cafés. Revenue generated from the roasting facility is
accounted for within our trade segment.

**_Snacks, Cold Drinks and Non-Food Items Sold Through Our PoS_**

We offer a range of free-standing PoS for snacks, cold drinks, or a combination of the two. Each PoS can be
configured as a free vend or pay vend PoS, with pay vend PoS being accompanied by a choice of various
cashless payment systems.

Our snack, cold drinks and combination PoS are primarily differentiated by their product capacity. For
example, each of our Santa Fe touch and Santa Fe XL machine models are equipped to vend snacks,
confectionary items, cans, bottles and tetra packs, and their flexible layouts allow for easy reconfiguration to
accommodate changes in product offering or layout, i.e. snacks and cold beverage combination in the warm
months and snacks and hot beverage combination in the colder months. Through the electronic shelf labels and
the touchscreen of the Santa Fe Touch, we can ensure accurate and up-to-date price, allergy, and nutrition
information is provided to the consumers. We generally offer customers a standard assortment of brand name and
top sellers snacks and beverages, but the product mix can also be tailored to the customer’s needs to reflect, for
example, particular regional tastes in snack foods or drinks as well as locally-sourced items.

Our newest glass-fronted cold drinks machines, such as the St. Tropez, include a modern cooling system
which concentrates the air flow at the front of the shelves in order to provide the next drinks to be dispensed at
the optimum temperature, and ensures a shake-free delivery at an ergonomic height. They also feature an
integrated robotic lift, which delivers the selected drink to the carousel within ten seconds, and use energy-saving
LED lights. These machines can be programmed to automatically switch off the illumination or reduce the chiller
outside of working hours.

In addition, our PoS typically feature separators, which can be easily removed for cleaning and separate
access to payment systems.

**_Water Dispensers_**

Our water dispensers are primarily suited for offices and other private settings. Our water dispensers use tap
water with integrated filtration systems to control water quality, allow the water temperature to be adjusted and,
depending on the type of dispenser, offer multiple water dispensing options—unchilled, medium chilled or
chilled still water and medium or highly carbonated soda water. Additionally, flavor concentrates can be installed
inside the water dispenser unit to provide flavored water.

**_HoReCa Product Range_**

HoReCa are products offered historically by Pelican Rouge and targeted at hospitality professionals, such as
food self-service chains, hotels and restaurants. HoReCa products are fully automatic, table top dispensers
suitable for high use environments that provide a wide variety of hot drinks, such as espressos, cappuccinos, hot
chocolates and teas. These products have a distinctive and refined aesthetic appeal, which is a key factor in this
segment. Our line of HoReCa products and services are differentiated on cup capacity and efficiency, multibeverage optionality and flexibility, allowing our customers to select a model that is ideally suited to their
particular environment and the taste and preferences of their consumers.

**_MicroMarkets_**

MicroMarkets, which are unmanned and unattended, self-service convenience stores designed for the
workplace in companies with over 200 employees, are a recent addition to our product offering. These
MicroMarkets provide a wide product range, including fresh products, coffee, drinks and snacks, and are a lowercost alternative for consumers to office cafeterias with similar offerings and limited times of operation.
Alternatively, the self-checkout system in MicroMarkets is available 24 hours a day. MicroMarkets offer a
greater variety of products than traditional self-service retail, specifically fresh foods offerings, such as
sandwiches or fruits, and innovative and healthy snacks and drinks. MicroMarkets allow us to sell products in
various formats and sizes and offer an innovative and digital consumer experience through the ability to touch
products and read labels and the advanced checkout process, while requiring significantly lower capital
expenditures compared with traditional PoS with impulse offerings and less complex operational and planning
requirements of cafeterias.

-----

**_Machines, Machine Parts and Products_**

We also sell new and unwanted used machines, machine parts and products to customers and third parties,
including self-service retail operators, separately and independent of service arrangements. Certain customers
contract with us for the supply of products to stock existing machines on their premises. Revenue generated from
such sales is accounted for within our trade segment. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, revenue from
trade sales of machines and products amounted to €253.2 million, or 16% of our total revenue for the period.

**Our Services**

In conjunction with our range of PoS for our workplace and on-the-go channels, we offer three categories of
services to meet our customers’ needs: full services package, partial service package, and supply/technical
services.

**_Full Service Package_**

Our full service package is our most comprehensive self-service retail concept. It includes installation of
PoS, regular filling and cleaning of PoS, as well as cash collection and technical maintenance. In addition, daily
or weekly visits ensure that our customers’ PoS are well-maintained, functioning properly and frequently stocked
with fresh products, including new product introductions. Under our full services package, we pay a fee to our
customer based on sold cups or a flat fee, and we directly collect the proceeds of the sales from the PoS.

**_Partial Service Package_**

Our partial service concept primarily targets smaller office environments. Under this package, we provide
the PoS and the ingredients to the customer in exchange for a monthly fee or vending fee. The customer is
responsible for cleaning and refilling the PoS. We primarily offer our partial services package to address the OCS
segment.

**_Supply/Technical Services_**

We also offer our technical support services under separate contracts negotiated with the customer, and
these can be combined with our other services to meet the customers’ specific needs.

**Payment Options**

Our pay vend PoS allow for a range of payment options from traditional cash payments with coins to
cashless and mobile payment technologies. These include employee cash cards and keys, bank cards and credit
cards, corporate cashless payment systems and mobile phone payments, including Selecta eWallet, which we
introduced in the summer 2018 as a lower cost (to us) alternative to other contactless payment systems, and the
Argenta App (described below). Cash card and key options are relatively common among our PoS located in
offices or other private points of sale due to the ability to set different prices for different consumers, such as
company personnel and visitors. As the growth in the use of alternative payment methods accelerates, credit card
and mobile phone payment options are more frequently included in our PoS located at publicly accessible points
of sale. We have also started to add alternative payment methods to our paid vend PoS in semi-public and private
sites. Cashless payment options help to support sales from PoS and enable higher average spend of consumers
than cash transactions. We have, therefore, updated our Selecta app and Selecta eWallet, to function not only as a
tool to locate our PoS, but also as a method of payment at certain of our PoS, including all public PoS in
Switzerland and approximately 8,000 PoS in Italy. Similarly, in addition to being a cashless method of payment,
the Argenta App is designed to feature a variety of promos and a loyalty program to incentivize the repeated use
of Argenta’s PoS. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 42,287 cashless devices.

Certain customers in our private channel make our PoS available to their employees on a free vend or
partially subsidized basis. This is particularly true for office coffee machines and is more common among our
customers in Northern European and Scandinavian countries.

**Competition and Market Position**

The Unattended SSR Market is characterized by fragmentation and intense competition on a local level. We
are one of the very few self-service retail operators active on a pan-European level. We are the leading routebased unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider in Europe by revenue, with operations in
16 countries across Europe. We compete with regional players in Europe such as Kaffeepartner, Dallmayr, IVS

120


-----

and Daltys, among others, and with Nespresso and JDE and other OCS providers, in our workplace business
channel. In addition, we compete against a large number of small players that operate a few PoS on a local or
regional basis, particularly in our workplace channel. See “Industry and Market Data” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Business—We operate in a highly competitive market, and if we do not compete effectively, we_
_may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our products and services.”_

**Customers and Consumers**

**_Customers_**

We serve a large base of public, semi-public and private customers, including companies, manufacturing,
logistics, and office environments, hospitals and universities, hotels, restaurants and cafés, as well as networks of
gas stations, airports, train and subway stations. We broadly segregate our customers into workplace and
on-the-go customers. Our customers in our North region are predominantly workplace coffee focused, while our
Central region customers are on-the-go focused, and our South, UK, and Ireland region customers are
predominantly comprised of private customers. We aim to further expand our customer base and, for example,
we have recently won or renewed contracts with Madrid Airport in Spain, Amsterdam UMC hospital and the
National Police in the Netherlands, Texaco (fuel provider) in Belgium, Volvo (car manufacturer) in Sweden,
Welcome Break (motorway services operator) and Coca Cola European Partners in the UK and the Pathé
Gaumont Cinema chain in France.

For public customers and, to a very limited extent, large private customers, we generally pay vending fees to
place our PoS on their premises. Vending fee arrangements include fixed or variable fees (based on a percentage
of revenue from vends) as well as a combination of the two. They are based on a number of factors, including
tender specifications for public bids, competitive pressure, contract length, offers by competitors, expected
revenue, locations and the demographics of the relevant locations. Our extended experience in the self-service
retail operator industry provides us with insight to help determine competitive yet prudent vending fee levels.
Vending fees are typically higher for countries with a higher share of public PoS in their portfolio, given that
these fees refer to the consideration paid to customers for the use of their premises.

In addition to originating new customer business, our sales teams coordinate and monitor the renewal of
customer contracts and the public tenders in which we participate. Approximately an average of 20% of our
contracts are up for renewal each year. In our private self-service retail operations (including our OCS services),
typical customer contract terms range from three to five years. Our contracts with public customers are
frequently longer, typically ranging from five to ten years. Our customer contracts typically provide us with the
exclusive right to install and operate PoS on our customer’s premises, although certain contracts with public
customers do not include such exclusivity rights. Our customer contracts generally automatically renew for a
period of one or two years at the end of the initial term in the absence of notice of termination. The notice period
for termination of customer contracts is typically three or six months for each contracting party. In the event of a
breach of contract that has not been remedied within one month from the provision of notice of the breach, our
customer contracts commonly allow for termination by the non-breaching party at any time.

We believe our reputation for quality products, innovation and customer service has enabled us to form
strong and long lasting customer relationships across a broad range of customers. We believe this is also evident
in our overall average customer retention rate. We estimate that our retention rate was approximately 95.9% for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, without taking into account the Express Vending Acquisition, which is
an increase of approximately 1.8% compared to the same period in 2018.

121


-----

In terms of revenue, we maintain a low customer concentration; for example, for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2019, our top ten customers accounted for 9.0% of our revenue, and no single customer accounted for
more than approximately 1.5% of our revenue for the same period. The following table presents information
related to our top ten customers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019:

**_Consumers_**

Food and beverages available from our PoS are purchased by individuals who consume such items during
breaks, as in-between meals in their offices, at recreational or educational facilities, in hospitals, schools,
government buildings, while on-the-go on public transportation, at airports or at highway service or gas stations.
As a result, we devote significant resources to the consumer experience and specifically to maintaining our PoS
and keeping them clean, updated and well-stocked with international brand-name and local products that appeal
to a variety of demographics and palettes. Furthermore, we leverage the data we collect through telemetry to
tailor our offering of drinks and snacks in each location based on local consumer preferences in order to enhance
the consumer experience with our PoS.

**Procurement**

Our Group procurement department is responsible for negotiating contracts for various products and stock,
which are used uniformly throughout the Group. Such items include machines, coffee, sugar, cups, stirrers and
other ancillary products. In purchasing these products at the Group level, we are able to leverage our size to
obtain better terms than our smaller regional competitors. Certain other items, such as confectionary products and
machine spare parts, and the organization of logistics related to such items generally remain the responsibility of
our local procurement departments at the country level.

**_Product Suppliers_**

We purchase our supplies and stock from a number of suppliers, including from private label suppliers as
well as brand name producers such as Coca-Cola, Danone, Lavazza, Mars, Mondelez, Nestlé, Pepsi and
Starbucks. We purchase the green coffee beans used for our coffee roasting business from Mercon Europe SL,
Supremo SA, Ecom Agroindustrial Corp. Ltd., Bernard Rothfos GmbH and Coffeeteam SA, and most volume is
sourced from Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia. We choose our suppliers carefully and value maintaining a broad
supplier base. For significant portions of our purchasing volumes, we generally enter into framework agreements
with our suppliers pursuant to which products and materials, quality standards, terms and prices are specified.
Such framework agreements typically have terms of three years. Due to the extensive variety of types and brands
of food and drinks we can offer in our PoS, we are not faced with supplier concentration.

122


-----

**_Machine Suppliers_**

We purchase and lease our machines from 16 key suppliers, including Franke for our premium hot drink
machines, WMF for coffee machines, Evoca Group for our mainstream hot drink machines, Crane MS and
Sielaff for our combination public machines and Borg & Overström for our water dispensers, with no single
supplier representing more than 30% of total PoS capital expenditures. We purchase or lease a variety of
different models of machines depending on, among others, the market, concept, product volumes, and the
customer’s requirements. See “—Real Estate and Equipment.” We purchase our machines in the currency of the
supplier to limit our foreign exchange exposure. As of June 30, 2019, we owned approximately 78% of the PoS
in our active PoS park, while the remainder were operated through leases.

**_Refurbishment Capability_**

As part of our strategy to improve our offering and deliver the best self-service and convenience solutions to
our customers and consumers, from time to time we upgrade our public PoS with a new appearance. We have
two primary refurbishment facilities for such purposes located in Milan and Madrid, with a third smaller site in
Dordrecht. While the majority of the refurbishments are processed in one of our three refurbishment facilities, in
cases where the shipping costs for the amount of work required are prohibitive, we use external providers in the
local market. Collectively, our refurbishment plants and external providers can upgrade or repair approximately
30,000 PoS per year. As a result of the Argenta Acquisition, we have gained new and more cost-effective
methods of refurbishment. Refurbishing and upgrading existing PoS can save up to 70% of capital expenditures
when compared to buying a new PoS.

**Innovation**

We are continuously upgrading and improving our PoS park with the latest technology. Telemetry devices
provide real-time sale information from our PoS to remote data collection points. We can then use this data to
improve our product selection for each PoS and our over-all business strategy based on major trends. We also
incur lower service costs by collecting such data as we avoid unnecessary trips to already well-stocked PoS.
Additionally, real time inventory monitoring allows us to avoid stock-outs and lost sales. Approximately 29% of
our eligible PoS park has already been upgraded with telemetry devices as of June 30, 2019, while we aim to
roll-out telemetry to all eligible PoS across the footprint. The number of PoS that include telemetry devices has
increased to 65,813 as of June 30, 2019, from 9,643, 21,573, and 41,612 as of September 30, 2016, 2017 and
2018, respectively.

We are also upgrading our PoS to support cashless technology to enhance check-out experience at the point
of sale by providing access to non-cash payment methods, i.e. credit cards and proprietary apps. Among other
cashless payment options, consumers can choose to pay with their smart-phones through our apps, including the
Selecta eWallet or the Argenta App. See “—Payment Options.” We have been steadily increasing the number of
our PoS equipped with cashless payments, with a cost of approximately €150 to €300 to upgrade each PoS,
depending on the type of payment system and PoS, and approximately 20% of our eligible PoS park has already
been upgraded as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 42,287 cashless devices,
primarily located in public locations.

**Sales, Marketing and Customer Service**

Our sales and marketing activities are largely organized on a decentralized basis. While our best practices,
brand guidelines and sales and marketing concepts are developed centrally at our office in Cham, Switzerland,
the implementation of such practices and concepts is conducted at the country level. Similarly, the organization
of our sales and marketing teams varies by country. In some countries, particularly the smaller countries in which
we operate, the head functions in sales and marketing are combined in one role. In larger countries, we typically
have distinct sales and marketing directors responsible for the respective activities, including setting the budgets
and oversight of small teams of sales and marketing representatives focused on our customers and services in that
country. At a Group level, we incentivize our sales force to focus on increasing turnover contribution margins,
contract length, and customer retention. Following the integration of the Pelican Rouge Group and the Argenta
Group, we have developed strategic initiatives to increase sales efficiency (particularly in France and in the UK),
such as increased focus on customer satisfaction, systematic approach to gathering customer feedback,
introduction of training and incentivizing staff based on customer satisfaction and local sales team offering
specifically tailored propositions to new customers. We have rolled out a strategic sales acceleration program in
Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK as a result of these initiatives.

123


-----

Our private customers frequently come to us through a combination of channels. The Selecta and Pelican
Rouge brand names are among the largest self-service retail companies in the market and potential new
customers may contact us directly. However, we have structured lead generation processes in place, where leads
can be generated from visit to our websites, prospects entered into our CRM tool, incoming calls to our customer
service/telesales departments and also sales force cold calling/visits. The main focus of our local marketing teams
is lead generation. In addition, larger private companies tender their services and we are usually invited to these
tenders. Our cooperation and framework agreements with facility management also provide us with new
customers and leads.

We have developed for our sales team a central program coordination team with strong local capabilities
and support to help harmonize prices in all of our markets. We differentiate prices by applying segmentation and
deploying segment specific and location specific price strategies and to monitor and analyzing sales data
collected through telemetry, in order to formulate pricing strategies for each category of products in each market,
we then focus on price strategies for the top ten popular products in each market. Our telemetry data also allows
for a dynamic pricing strategy, which is capable of adapting to consumer reactions in real time. In the
business-to-business to consumer space we have implemented margin management on underperforming accounts
and systematic annual price increases in addition to price differentiation between brand and non-brand items; in
the business-to-business space, we have implemented similar systematic annual price increases, in addition to
upselling products such as premium coffee and reducing leakage.

We continually aim to provide efficient and effective customer care. Our business operates with the support
of service call centers in each country, which accept inbound calls for PoS malfunctions and maintenance issues,
and sales call centers, which place outbound calls to generate sales of our OCS and machine products and
services. Our relevant call centers’ telephone numbers are displayed on all of our PoS, allowing customers or
consumers to directly get in touch with us for a quick resolution of any maintenance or other technical issues. In
addition, inbound calls received by customers can be directed to technicians to help customers troubleshoot or
resolve technical issues in order to avoid the need for, and time and expense associated with, a site visit. We
improved our average of serviced PoS per technician from 264 for the year ended September 30, 2017 (after
giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition) to 269 over the same period in 2018.

**Information Technology**

Our IT operations have historically been performed primarily on a decentralized basis. In particular, IT
functions related to matters such as procurement, tracking and logistics have largely been managed at the country
level, supported by four teams of IT personnel located in Switzerland, Spain, the Netherlands, France and the
United Kingdom. We continue to invest in our IT systems in order to maintain and enhance our overall business
processes. We use IT solutions in nearly all phases of our operations, from procuring machines, spare parts and
products to monitoring operational processes and tracking logistics and maintenance of our machines.

Furthermore, certain IT systems acquired through the Argenta Acquisition support and facilitate the use and
development of various applications, information streams, and other services that are vital to the efficiency of
business operations. This includes, among others, field service management, supply chain management, business
sales, and finance. We have a dedicated IT department in Italy, with the capability to assist our Italian operations
on all software-related projects.

We have undertaken a detailed assessment of our IT infrastructure, systems, and applications and are
currently in the process of implementing an enhanced IT architecture with a more centralized focus, in particular
with respect to core applications.

**Real Estate and Equipment**

We conduct our operations primarily through PoS that we own. We own or lease a combination of
warehouses and regional and branch offices in many of the countries in which we operate. Our properties are
typically leased for fixed terms of between five and 20 years. In general, our lease agreements can be terminated
at our option prior to the maturity date, in certain cases with a penalty. We believe that our properties meet our
present needs and that they are sufficiently maintained and suitable for their intended use. Additionally, we have
started to lease our coffee roasting plant in the Netherlands since September 2019, pursuant to a sale and
leaseback transaction in respect of all lands and buildings of our roasting facility. The term of the lease, in line
with our other lease agreements, is 20 years.

With respect to other fixed assets, we owned and operated more than 475,000 PoS as of June 30, 2019, and a
fleet of over 5,000 vehicles dedicated to restocking our PoS. Depending on the country, we either purchase or

124


-----

lease our vehicles through finance or operating leases. We believe our equipment is in good condition and
suitable for our operations and their intended use.

We depreciate our free-standing hot drink PoS over a period of six years, table top machines over a period
of four years, and snack and cold drink PoS over a period of eight years. However, we are generally able to
utilize our PoS beyond such four or eight year period, with table top machines lasting up to eight years and snack
and cold drink PoS lasting up to 20 years, with the appropriate refurbishment. We continually refurbish and
upgrade some of our PoS to extend their useful life. For example, public PoS can be refurbished twice, tripling
their useful life. PoS that are not refurbished and redeployed are either sold or scrapped. The typical cost of a
refurbished PoS is approximately 30% to 40% that of a new PoS, which can vary widely depending on the level
of refurbishment required.

**Employees**

As of June 30, 2019, we had 10,305 FTEs, compared to 9,757 FTEs as of September 30, 2018, and 9,878 as
of September 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2019, 1,387, or 13%, of our FTEs were technicians and 4,896, or 48%,
were merchandizers employees. As of September 30, 2018, 1,389 of our FTEs were technicians and 4,679 were
merchandizers employees, compared to 1,447 technicians and 4,751 merchandizers employees as of
September 30, 2017.

The following table shows the number of Selecta’s FTEs by region for the periods indicated.

**_Pension and Benefits_**

We operate various pension and retirement schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in the
countries in which we operate. We have defined contribution plans in place for certain employees in Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and defined benefit
plans for certain employees in Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
These pension plans provide for the payment of retirement and certain survivor benefits. Benefits payable under
these plans are determined on the basis of any employee’s length of service, earnings and position. Under the
defined benefit plans, employees are entitled to retirement benefits equal to a percentage of their accumulated
savings in the plan on reaching a locally defined retirement age. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our
employee benefits expense increased by 10.2% from the previous year.

We also operate a management remuneration bonus policy, which is designed to attract and retain quality
people and to be in line with, or above, market standards. The terms and conditions of our management
remuneration bonus policy are determined at our headquarters and are consistent across the Group. We have
designed this policy to facilitate communication of annual goals to be achieved in each management band.

**_Collective Bargaining Agreements_**

The countries in which we operate provide various protections and bargaining or other rights to employees.
These employment rights may require us to expend greater time and costs in negotiating or amending employees’
terms of employment or making staff reductions.

We have collective bargaining agreements in place with our employees in Finland, Italy, the Netherlands,
Sweden and France. In Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden, we have works councils
in place, which are representative bodies for our employees and through which we agree changes in conditions of
employment, such as working hours, salary levels and benefits. We consider our relations with the works
councils to be good.

125


-----

In all other countries in which we operate, we are subject to applicable national or state legislation which, in
many cases, establishes minimum salaries and benefits for certain types of jobs and apply to all companies
employing individuals in these jobs. The terms of these agreements vary from country to country, but they
generally address matters such as minimum wage, salary adjustments, working hours, breaks and vacation and
are typically agreed for terms of up to several years.

**Intellectual Property**

We rely primarily on a combination of trademarks, trade names and license agreements to protect our
intellectual property rights. Our primary trademarks include “Selecta,” “Miofino,” “fresh+fit,” “fresh point” and
“mySoup” as well as associated word-picture trademarks. We are also the holder of various national and
European Community trademarks for our “Selecta” brand name in the markets in which we operate. Following
the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition, we increased our portfolio of material intellectual
property rights with the trademarks relating to Pelican Rouge and Argenta’s various brands (e.g. “Pelican
Rouge,” “ICS,” “Gruppo Argenta,” “Café Bon,” “My Vending”) and the trademark portfolio of Somed, which
was acquired by Argenta in 2016. This extensive trademark portfolio contains 325 international, European and
national registrations. Most of the trademarks are registered in the name of Selecta U.K. Limited, Pelican Rouge
Group BV, and Gruppo Argenta S.p.A. With the exception of the “Selecta,” “Pelican Rouge,” and “Argenta”
brand names, we do not believe that any individual item of our intellectual property portfolio is material to our
business or the conduct of our business as a whole. To date, no third party has brought legal or administrative
proceedings challenging the validity of our trademarks or trade names.

We cooperate with certain of our machine suppliers and manufacturers to participate in the development of
new machine models and technologies. We hold certain intellectual property rights in connection with these
machines developed or being developed.

**Insurance**

We maintain general liability, property, directors’ and officers’, business interruption and other insurance
policies with coverage limits we consider consistent with industry practice. The terms of our customer contracts
typically provide that the customer will ensure that the PoS placed on its premises are insured against third party
claims and carry certain insurance protection against damage or vandalism, whether as part of its general
insurance policies or insured separately. Our other fixed assets, such as our office buildings, technical equipment
used in distribution, restocking and PoS refurbishment, information technology and office equipment, are
protected by a bundled industrial insurance policy (damages from fire, catastrophes, theft, flood and severe
weather) that includes a business interruption insurance when business interruption is caused by an insured
property damage. We monitor our insurance policies to ensure that we remain in compliance with any conditions
thereunder.

We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the nature of the risks covered and amounts
insured for our business operations and review our coverage on a periodic basis. However, there can be no
assurance that we will not suffer a loss or losses that are not covered by our insurance policies or that may be in
excess of the amount of insurance coverage. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our insurance
_is limited and subject to exclusions, and depends on the ongoing viability of our insurers; we may also incur_
_liabilities or losses that are not covered by insurance.”_

**Regulation**

The food and beverage industry is regulated by various European and national legislation and regulations
covering food safety and hygiene, packaging, nutritional information, broader public health and diet concerns,
and public tenders for placement of PoS on public premises. As a PoS operator, we are subject to the
requirements of a number of EU and national regulations administered by the European Food Safety Authority
and national government entities and agencies in the countries in which we operate.

The primary EU regulations that relate to our business are EU Regulation 178/2002 and EU Regulation
852/2004. EU Regulation 178/2002 establishes the European Food Safety Authority as well as general principles
and requirements of food law in the European Union and procedures in matters of food safety. This regulation is
specified, inter alia, by EU Regulation 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of
compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules. EU Regulation 852/2004 sets out
general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs. Additional regulations include EU
Regulation 853/2004, which regulates, among other things, the temperature settings of PoS that stock products

126


-----

made from or containing animal products, such as meats and cheeses, and EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the
provision of food information to consumers. As we do not manufacture our own PoS or produce our own
products (other than coffee beans sourced from our roasting plant), our daily operations of sourcing and stocking
products and cleaning and providing technical maintenance and support on our PoS are impacted by such
regulations to a limited extent; however, we have to ensure that the PoS are operated in compliance with
applicable law. Moreover, as we continue to source a wide variety of our products in the countries in which the
PoS are located, our suppliers are primarily responsible for ensuring that their products meet applicable
packaging, nutritional information and other requirements.

In the EU countries in which we operate, we have implemented Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points
(“HACCP”) concepts and systems with regard to food hygiene and in accordance with the requirements of EU
Regulation 852/2004 and applicable national legislation. Our employees in such countries are trained at least
annually to comply with the HACCP procedures.

In Switzerland, the handling (i.e., manufacture, processing, storage, transportation, and placing on the
market) of foodstuffs and utility articles is governed by a number of laws and regulations aimed at protecting
consumers’ health, setting minimal hygiene standards, preventing consumer fraud and mandating minimum
nutritional fact information on product labels. The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles of June 20,
2014, as amended (the “FSA”) is the framework legislation in the area of foodstuff and utility articles. The FSA
lays down general requirements for the safety, hygiene and labelling of foodstuffs and utility articles, stipulates
licensing and reporting requirements for businesses and sets out the powers and duties of the enforcement
authorities. A number of implementation ordinances have been enacted by the federal administration under the
FSA, further detailing the requirements prescribed by the FSA.

One of the main purposes of the FSA and its implementation ordinances was to remove previously existing
barriers of trade in the area of foodstuffs and utility articles by aligning Swiss regulations with those of the EU.
Accordingly, the Swiss legislation was based on EU Regulation 178/2002 with regard to foodstuffs and EU
Product Safety Directive 2001/95 with regard to utility articles. However, certain elements of prior Swiss
regulation, e.g., the obligation to indicate the country of production or the origin of ingredients in pre-packaged
foodstuffs, have been retained.

Self-monitoring is a fundamental component of Swiss food legislation. It means that each company is
responsible for complying with the legal requirements. Self-monitoring includes the following elements:
(i) ensuring good practice and protection against deception, (ii) applying the HACCP system or its principles,
(iii) conducting product samplings and analysis, (iv) safeguarding traceability, (v) withdrawal and recall of
products in case of potential hazard, and (vi) documentation duties. The employers’ and employees’ associations
GastroSuisse, hotelleriesuisse, CafetierSuisse and the Swiss industry Association for Hospitality, Home and
Community Catering have promulgated a guideline on Good Practices in the Hospitality Industry (the
“Guideline GVG”), which was approved by the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (the “FSVO”)
on September 21, 2018. The Guideline GVG covers all relevant aspects of food law and sets out the procedure
and scope of self-regulation. It sets the standard for best practice for operating the business in compliance with
the law. By virtue of the approval of the FSVO, the Guideline GVG has a binding character and applies to our
business.

**Environment and Sustainability**

We are committed to operating our business while respecting the environment and other social
considerations. Our past and present operations, including owned and leased real property, are subject to
environmental laws, regulations and local permit requirements related to the discharge of materials into the
environment, the handling and disposition of waste or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are also
committed to reducing our carbon footprint through various measures, such as supplying PoS that use modern
technology to increase energy efficiency, optimize waste streams, including plastics, disposables and coffee
grounds, disposing of our PoS and equipment in accordance with the standards of the European Commission’s
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and developing automated route-planning systems to
reduce total driving distances. All of our Group’s policies and business activities are consistent with the United
Nations Global Compact. We also take a proactive approach with respect to a safe and healthy workplace
through regular employee training and development, Group-wide employee satisfaction surveys and a Groupwide health and safety monitoring system.

We are committed to minimizing the environmental impact of our operations by reducing our carbon
footprint and by contributing to a circular economy. We aim to make optimal use of our fleet, provide energy

127


-----

efficient self-service retail solutions, and optimize our waste streams, including plastics, disposables, and coffee
grounds. For example, waste streams from our roaster and customers are used by third parties, and we are also
supporting a carbon offset project in Peru, on climate friendly cook stoves. We are also committed to sourcing
our raw materials and products sustainably, and to stimulating healthier choices through innovative concepts. We
offer a wide range of certified sustainable products spanning approximately 50% of our coffee offering and a
variety of healthy food and drinks.

We operate a coffee roasting facility located in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, through Pelican Rouge Coffee
Roasters. This facility qualifies as a type B facility under the applicable Dutch environmental laws given its
potential impact on the environment. Therefore, the facility does not require an environmental operating permit
(omgevingsvergunning milieu) to carry out its coffee roasting activities but the facility’s operations are subject to
general environmental rules as enumerated in the Dutch Activities Decree (Activiteitenbesluit wet milieubeheer)
and to an annual assessment. We aim to produce high quality coffee products while demonstrating respect for the
environment. To that end, we have obtained several quality certificates demonstrating sound environment and
quality management systems, in addition to certificates relating to coffee roasting products such as a BRC Global
Standards Food certificate, a Sustainable Agriculture Network certificate, an UTZ Chain of Custody Standard
certificate, and a Bio-certificate as required by EU law on organic production and labeling of organic products.

**Legal, Arbitral and Administrative Proceedings**

From time to time, we are party to proceedings, including legal, arbitral and administrative proceedings,
arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as disputes with our customers, suppliers and employees, and
disputes regarding representations and warranties under agreements, for previous acquisitions and dispositions.

On July 13, 2018, SNCF Mobilites initiated a claim against Selecta SAS and Selecta AG for unpaid invoices
under a contract dated July 1, 2014, between Selecta and SNCF, the French railway company, for a term of
eleven years. Pursuant to this agreement, we place our PoS at SNCF’s train stations where travelers may make
purchases in exchange for a monthly vending fee. During April through June of 2018 rail-workers in France
staged sustained strikes, as a result of which foot traffic at train stations was severely reduced. Consequently, our
revenue from sales generated at SNCF’s stations was also severely reduced. We therefore paid SNCF a reduced
vending fee for the months of April through June, proportional to the days during which there were no strike.
SNCF’s claim is for the full value of the vending fees. The court rejected this claim on September 26, 2018.
However, on appeal the court of appeal (Cour administrative d’appel de Paris) ruled in favor of SNCF for the
entire claim amount of €8.1 million. Despite these proceedings, our relationship with SNCF remains positive
with the contract continuing in effect through 2025.

On July 17, 2014, the Italian Competition Authority (“ICA”) initiated proceedings against the Argenta
Group pursuant to article 14 of Law n. 287/90 to assess an allegation against Argenta Group and eight other
companies operating in the self-service retail section in connection with potential unlawful market sharing. On
February 25, 2015, the ICA initiated proceedings against three additional companies and CONFIDA
Associazione Italiana Distribuzione Automatica, the association representing the main companies of the Italian
retail industry, and extended the investigation into further allegations of anti-competitive behavior in relation to
certain private and public tenders for self-service retail services. On June 14, 2016, the ICA issued its final
decision holding that the Argenta Group and all other parties to the proceeding (except for Gedac S.r.l.) had
infringed art. 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The ICA imposed on all parties fines
at the maximum possible level, consisting of 10% of the overall annual turnover of a company. The fine imposed
on Argenta Group is equal to €19.7 million. On June 27, 2016, the ICA granted Argenta Group’s request to pay
the fine in 30 monthly installments of €0.7 million each beginning in August 2016 and ending in January 2019;
these payments were not indemnified under the Argenta Acquisition Agreement. On November 28, 2017,
Argenta Group filed an appeal before the Italian Council of State to obtain a reduction of the amount of the fine.
All installments of the penalty have been paid, however, the appeal for the reduction of the total amount remains
ongoing. Individuals or companies affected by the illegal conduct could rely on the ICA decision to bring civil
damages actions against Argenta Group and the other addressees of the decision. Damages actions are subject to
a limitation period of five years from cessation of the damaging conduct. In this case, the damaging conduct
could be deemed to have stopped, when the ICA opened the relevant investigation in July 2014, and no damage
action has been brought to date.

The Dutch tax authorities have challenged the deductibility of interest expenses on certain shareholder loans
of Pelican Rouge B.V. for the financial years 2011 through 2014, and concluded that interest on these
shareholder loans is not deductible. This conclusion has resulted in additional tax assessments of approximately

128


-----

€22 million. We appealed this decision in 2016. The Dutch tax authorities rejected our objection and we filed an
appeal with the Court of The Hague in January 2017. We are awaiting a judgement from the court. The total tax
losses carried forward attributable to the relevant period amount to €293.6 million, which could be partly
disallowed depending on the outcome of the case. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not
made any payment to the tax authorities. In connection with this claim, the purchase price for the acquisition of
Pelican Rouge was reduced. In addition, we issued contingent value notes in favor of the previous owners of
Pelican Rouge B.V. which are payable in the event that the final tax assessment due and payable is less than the
amount of the purchase price reduction, in which case an amount representing the difference between the
purchase price reduction and the final tax assessment is payable to the previous owners of Pelican Rouge B.V.
The amount due under these contingent value notes (if any) will become payable following the settlement of the
tax claim, which is currently included as an accrual on our balance sheet.

The Swedish Tax Agency (“STA”) has denied interest expense deductions of Selecta Nordic Holding AB
for the financial year 2016. We have appealed this decision and are awaiting a judgement from the administrative
court. The interest expense deductions denied for this period amount to approximately €1.9 million, and the STA
has disallowed approximately €7 million of tax losses carried forward. If our appeal is successful, the STA will
be required to amend the affected tax returns.

Other than claims disclosed above, we are not currently involved in any material pending legal, arbitral or
administrative proceedings nor are we aware of any threatened material claims or matters against us.

Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

TopCo has 3,330,805 issued and outstanding shares which are beneficially held by KKR and certain

either be (x) capitalized, (y) paid in cash (to the extent sufficient cash reserves are available) or (z) satisfied by
the issuance of additional PECs instruments when it falls due. The PECs are subordinated to all existing and
future third-party indebtedness of the relevant shareholder debtor, and have other terms characteristic of deeply

**Revolving Credit Facility Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

On January 15, 2018, the Issuer entered into a super senior revolving credit facility agreement with, among
others, Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch as agent, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited as the Security Agent,

Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for a super senior revolving credit facility in a principal amount of
€150.0 million (the “Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility” for the purposes of this description).

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized by the Issuer, Selecta AG and Selecta TMP AG
and certain of its restricted subsidiaries which accede to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as

limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on indebtedness
covenant) to incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted additional facilities within
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or any additional notes and/or other facilities or notes
documented outside the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) up to an aggregate amount of the
greater of €200.0 million and 66% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and subject to certain customary additions including the amount of prepayments and
buy-backs).

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to de

mandatory prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a “Change of Control.”

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is defined as per the
Notes provided that the exercise of the portability feature shall be subject to the new owner of the Group being a
person on an agreed transferee list and each lender being satisfied with any necessary KYC and sanctions
requirements.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each Guarantor on a joint and several basis.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is secured by the same security interests as for the Notes as set
forth under “Description of the Notes—Security.”

Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles that apply to the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Group that generate at least 80%
of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”) are guarantors of the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (i) on the date which is 180 days following the Closing Date;
and (ii) thereafter on the date when the annual financial statements of the Issuer are required to be delivered to
the agent in connection with the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above are in all cases subject to certain
limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters
set forth in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and, to the extent such requirement is not
satisfied on such date, the Issuer shall ensure that it is so satisfied within 180 days of such date).

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties
(subject to certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including: (i) status,

(iii) no default, financial statements and no misleading information; (iv) no liens/indebtedness; (v) ownership;
(vi) intellectual property; and (vii) centre of main interests and compliance with sanctions and anti-corruption
laws.

Certain representations and warranties have been made on the Closing Date and will be repeated on the date

at certain other times.

-----

**_Covenants_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and
related definitions (with certain adjustments and exceptions) that are set forth in the Indenture.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a “note purchase condition” covenant.
Subject to certain exceptions set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Issuer may not, and shall
procure that no restricted subsidiary will, repay, prepay, purchase, defease, redeem or otherwise directly or
indirectly acquire or retire the principal amount of the Notes (or, in each case, any replacement or refinancing
thereof as permitted under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from time to time). The
exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) payments that do not exceed 50% of the aggregate
original principal amount of the Notes as at the Issue Date.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and
grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations and consents; (ii) compliance with laws;
(iii) provision of guarantees and security and further assurance; and (iv) compliance with sanctions, anti-money
laundering and anti-corruption laws.

In addition, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes a financial covenant requiring
the drawn super senior leverage ratio not to exceed a ratio of 0.835:1 (the “Drawn Super Senior Leverage
**Ratio”). The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated drawn loans under the**
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and any other funded indebtedness that ranks pari passu with such loans
in respect of the distribution of Recoveries (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to consolidated pro forma
EBITDA for the twelve month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing date and is tested quarterly on a
rolling basis, subject to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility being (excluding any utilizations by way of
letters of credit (or bank guarantees), ancillary facilities any flex or flex related fees or expenses) greater than
40% drawn on the relevant test date. The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio only acts as a draw stop to new
drawings under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and, if breached, will not trigger a default or an event
of default under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and adjustments in the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and the
equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the
shareholders of the Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Issuer to (i) increase
the consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, (ii) decrease
consolidated senior secured net debt as defined in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, or
(iii) prepay the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility so that the Test Condition (as defined in the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) is no longer satisfied. The equity cure right may not be exercised on more
than four occasions during the term of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and may not be utilized in
more than two occasions in any four consecutive quarters and in consecutive quarters.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will fall-away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a
listing in respect of which the Group’s Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed an agreed ratio; or (ii)
the Issuer having a long-term corporate credit rating equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody’s Investor
Services Limited or BBB- according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services.

**_Events of Default_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default
as under the Notes. In addition, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for additional
events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) inaccuracy of a
representation or statement when made; (ii) repudiation, rescission, invalidity and unlawfulness of the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility financing documents; and (iii) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or
in connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with

136


-----

English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
certain Guarantors and the Trustee have entered into an Intercreditor Agreement between, among others, the
agent, arrangers and lenders under our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security
Agent.

By accepting an Additional Note, holders of the Additional Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and
accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors (as defined below) or Third
Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to
which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover
provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and
not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Additional Notes and of the Trustee.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

For the purposes of this description

“Senior Secured Group” shall mean the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing (as defined below) has
been made available to or by a member of the Senior Secured Group which are designated by the Issuer as Senior

securities or other debt instruments issued or to be issued by or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has
been made available to or by a Topco Borrower (as defined below) which are designated by the Issuer as Topco

**Notes Liabilities” to refer to the Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer.**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities,
Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities or Hedging Liabilities
(each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the Issuer that such New Debt
Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under the
relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each agent in
respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities (as defined below) and the Security Agent (and each other person party
to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and
instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as
the case may be) subject to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be,
unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer or otherwise required by the Issuer to the extent that the existing
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is not being amended or released and the new
Transaction Security or new Topco Independent Transaction Security only secures the New Debt Financing,
substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after
the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a
Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the
Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance
against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the
incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be
granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is
no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities
under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be
given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i)
over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group
or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit
support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any
Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of
such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation relation to
such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but
not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility Liabilities
(together with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect
thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency
events in relation to a member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third
Party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under
_“—Application of Proceeds” provided that there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received,_
other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of
assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents (as defined
below) following an acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the
occurrence of an event of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured
**Discharge Date”), the Debtors may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien**
Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to
compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest)
is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or
if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been
issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a de
_minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under any_
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash
Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next
paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second
**Lien Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge**
**Date”), the Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other members of the Senior Secured**
Group may only make specified scheduled payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter, action or
dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the
Topco Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco
Creditors or any holding company of the Issuer or other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of
the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal,
interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management
Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a “Senior Secured Payment Default”), or
under the Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

143


-----

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco
Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit
such payment have been obtained, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or
capitalized interest (such other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if
applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages))) and default interest on the Topco Liabilities
accrued and payable in cash in accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance
Document (as at the date of the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a
result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of
currency indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt buy-back
program approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and
Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any
syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other
than in respect of paragraph (M) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien
Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower
under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (K) below)
irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the
payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in
respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without
double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted
by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco
Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring
advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or
restructuring advisors) and a Topco Agent’s fees, costs and expenses not exceeding €1,500,000, but
excluding the costs of any litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (or their
affiliates), (C) of any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs necessary to
protect, preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees
(including any original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses incurred
in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in relation to any
reporting or listing requirements under the Topco Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not
exceeding €2,500,000 in any twelve month period, (G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which
would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired
and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been capitalized and added to the
principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual
of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or any such amount
described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made if certain events of default have
occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of
making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities,
Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of the Topco
Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any
holding company of the Issuer (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent
payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as
defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities
owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to
the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result of any
such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien
Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien
Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or
Subordinated Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group, (I) of non-cash interest
made by way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non cash-pay instrument which is subordinated on the
same terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds
of Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents, (K) if the payment is
made by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents; and
such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or such
payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior Secured Group

144


-----

without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents unless the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or
borrower of any prior ranking debt facilities at such time and any such prior ranking debt facility has
been accelerated or an Insolvency Event (as defined below) has occurred; (L) if the payment is of a
principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance
Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment of a single lender in
the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and (M) if no Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing the payment
is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the
relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the
original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as
the case may be) of the applicable Topco Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance
Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the
occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or
an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent
(acting on the instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien
Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to
the agent under any Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco
**Notes Trustee”) advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing**
and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has
been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors gave the
instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the
Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event
of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set
of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a
payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect
of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco
**Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.**

145


-----

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to
make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt
Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of
interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a
payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco
**Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments**
which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as
applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop
Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions (including, but not limited to, a provision that provides that any Intra-Group
Lender in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities who is under a competing contractual requirement to turnover those
proceeds to any trade creditor of the Topco Group (and that competing obligations is not prohibited by a Finance
Document) is not required to turnover the applicable proceeds), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at
any time prior to the latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the
Second Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged
(the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor)
receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other litigation or
proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third Party Security
Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which

146


-----

is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of
that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on
trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or
distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by
which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event
that, at any time prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers
from any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any
proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or
following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the
charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the
Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of
_Proceeds.”_

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or
making of an order for insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or reorganization, (b) a
composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally (other than any
Secured Party), (c) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a
liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in
respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in
each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied
will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a
Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party Security Provider (in the
case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall
direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities
owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to
it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the
amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that
the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect
and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to
these provisions.

147


-----

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent of an
Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as
specified in the provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior
Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior
Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured
**Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Secured**
Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to
enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance
with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but
before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the Second
Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become enforceable,
if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement
instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security
Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct
the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver
instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later
of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have
instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party
Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities
(the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of
the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the
Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security
Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or

148


-----

indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super
Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the
paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit
and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen
should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and
(iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or
other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is request to do so by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of
accountants or third party financial adviser.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with
any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any
persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under
the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for the relative position in the capital structure.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Until the Priority Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group,
(i) no Topco Creditor or Topco Investor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce, or otherwise require the
enforcement of any Transaction Security (including the crystallization of any floating charge forming part of the
Transaction Security); (ii) no Topco Creditor nor Topco Investor shall take or require the taking of any
Enforcement Action (as defined below) against any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider (other than in each case (and to the extent not restricted by (i) above and (iii) below) against a Topco
Borrower) in relation to the Topco Group Liabilities; and (iii) no Topco Creditor nor Topco Investor nor Topco
Borrower shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action (as defined below) in relation to Topco
Proceeds Loan Liabilities, except in the case of each of (i) through (iii) as set out under “—Permitted Topco
_Enforcement” below._

Other than as restricted by (i) and (iii) in the paragraph above, any Topco Creditor may at any time take any
Enforcement Action (as defined below) against any Topco Investor, Topco Borrower or any Topco Guarantor
that is not a member of the Senior Secured Group, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Topco
Finance Documents.

149


-----

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply in
respect of the Topco Group Liabilities, Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities, or any Transaction Security securing the
Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (the
“Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and
Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default specifying the event or
circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee
or the Topco Borrower in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities;

150


-----

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of that Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice notifying
any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, the Second Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee of the existence of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a
Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the earliest to
occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular Debtor or
Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or a Topco
Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only take the same
Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the
Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not against any other member of the
Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph shall not include action taken to preserve or
protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor against
whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; and

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned Topco
Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted
remedy).

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may take
Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement) in relation to
a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at any later time, a further
Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may elect to purchase
the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash
Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the
amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and
expenses. Topco Creditors must also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging
obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable
under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in
connection with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document agrees that it shall (and is
irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from
any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the Issuer has
confirmed is the subject of:

(1) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable release and/
or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document including a disposal to

151


-----

a member of the Senior Secured Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any
member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance Document to provide replacement
security;

(2) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which that asset
will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group,

in each case where such disposal is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a
“Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to the extent that the
Issuer has confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document to effect any
amendment or waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take any
action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the
Senior Secured Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the extent that
the Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or guarantor in accordance with the
terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement); and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the extent
that the Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to be given or such release in
accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement); and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interest in a Debtor, other member of the Senior Secured
Group or any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor,
other member of the Senior Secured Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a
member of the Topco Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member
of the Senior Secured Group and its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the
Secured Debt Documents and the respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents
(including any claim relating to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A) or (i)(B) above, the Issuer shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date
of completion of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such
disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Issuer shall confirm
in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant release or cessation
is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the
Senior Secured Group or holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor,
to the extent the Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if
such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document,
such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any Transaction Security
which is being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction
Security has become enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction
Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the
enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a
person or persons which is not a member of the Topco Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the
cost of the relevant Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Issuer and without any consent, sanction,

152


-----

authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third Party Security
Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities;
(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf
of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor to
release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its
borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that holding company
or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of an intragroup lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets
or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to
dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of their
subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not intend that
any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend that any
Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the
liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors; and

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company of
a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of
the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities)
to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities,
liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the
obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not
occurred.

153


-----

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any
other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating
to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral
arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed
to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or,
in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary
facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that
release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities
transferred to a holding company of the Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the
cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being
effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in a
borrower or issuer of, or over assets of a borrower or issuer of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will
be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, Second Lien Notes Trustee, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or Topco
Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable
securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/
or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been obtained in accordance with the
provisions set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Parties (other than in relation to performance bonds, guarantees or
similar instruments issued by a Secured Creditor on behalf of a member of the Senior Secured
Group) against a member of the Senior Secured Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than
any minority interest not owned by members of the Senior Secured Group) are pledged in favor of
the Priority Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and
are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction Security, Topco
Independent Transaction Security or other security in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of the
assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged
concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim
(instead of a release or discharge):

(I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and
any Senior Secured Notes Trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the
Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged but
nevertheless less than the outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a notice on
the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

154


-----

(II) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent and
any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the
Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or
discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to the
Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”), and (ii) serve a notice on the
Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same; and

(III) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and the Topco
Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority Secured
Parties and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will recover more than if such claim was
released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the outstanding Priority Secured
Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively), and (ii) serve a notice on the Security
Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer
may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an
appropriate mechanic the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities
(as applicable) such that the relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged to the extent of
an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with the
advice of a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
professional firm with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably obtainable taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in which creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities
and Topco Liabilities are entitled to participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

(II) where a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing such valuations has delivered an
opinion (including an enterprise valuation) in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount
is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances including
the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such investment bank, firm of
accountants or third party professional firm in giving such opinion may be limited to the
amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first
date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses
are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at
the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the
Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security
Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments)
those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security
Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the
interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the
affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each of the agents or
trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior
Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (i) each Cash Management Facility Lender

obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (ii) each Hedge
Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iii) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or
authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to
any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent
may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents
under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be
binding on each party and the prior consent of the Secured Parties is required to authorize any amendment,
release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect
the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of
enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without

157


-----

limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not
be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

_Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_
(i) any release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in
each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to
the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,”
“—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be
effected solely by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action
or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or another
applicable agreement (but excluding any indenture), any creditor fails to respond to the request within ten
Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or
trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor
will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to have
provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically
operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to
the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares
are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in
full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer
which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio
calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions
of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any
holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider,
Investor (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released
from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and
as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien
Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing
more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO
Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents
and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required
to facilitate such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary.

**Finance Leases**

As of June 30, 2019, we had €40.6 million finance lease liabilities outstanding under various finance leases.
The finance leases are not subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Factoring**

Certain of our subsidiaries in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom have
entered into a non-recourse facility of receivables with ABN Asset Based Finance. The agreement entitles these

158


-----

entities to access €55.0 million of financing with no specified termination date, subject to local terms and
conditions, including interest rates tied to LIBOR or its local equivalent, customary for such transactions. As of
June 30, 2019, €48.2 million was outstanding under this non-recourse facility.

In addition, certain of our operating subsidiaries have entered into various bilateral lending facilities and
factoring arrangements, in each case subject to local terms and conditions customary for these transactions.

**Hedging Obligations**

We enter into cross currency swaps from time to time in order to hedge against currency risk related to our
borrowings. On February 2, 2018, we entered into cross currency swaps with a nominal value of €404 million
under which we swapped €125 million of the principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes into pound
sterling, €173 million of the principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes into Swedish krona, and
€106 million of the principal amount of the Existing Floating Rate Notes into Swiss franc. The fair value of the
swaps as of June 30, 2019, was €14.2 million.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the € million in aggregate principal amount of 5[7]/8% senior
secured notes due 2024 (the “New Euro Fixed Rate Notes”) and € million in aggregate principal amount
of senior secured floating rate notes due 2024 (the “New Floating Rate Notes” and together with the New Euro
Fixed Rate Notes, the “New Notes”). The New Notes will be issued by Selecta Group B.V., a private limited
liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (the “Issuer”). The Issuer will issue the New
Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of February 2, 2018 (the “Original Issue Date”), among,
_inter alios, the Issuer and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The New Notes will be_
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by AB Servicios Selecta España SLU, Acorn Spain 1
SLU, Argenta, Pelican Rouge Coffee Roasters B.V., Selecta AB, Selecta AG, Selecta Belgium
N.V., Selecta Nordic Holding AB, Selecta Holding SAS, Selecta Netherlands B.V., Selecta SAS, Selecta
TMP AG, Selecta U.K. Limited and Selecta UK Holding Limited (each a “Guarantor” and together, the
“Guarantors”).

Pursuant to the Indenture, the Issuer issued on the Original Issue Date €765.0 million 5[7]/8% senior secured
notes due 2024 (the “Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes” and together with the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the
“Euro Fixed Rate Notes”), €325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due
2024 (the “Existing Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the New Floating Rate Notes, the “Floating Rate
_Notes”) and CHF 250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5[7]/8% senior secured notes due 2024 (the “CHF_
_Notes” together with the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the “Existing_
_Notes” and together with the New Notes, the “Notes”)._

The New Euro Fixed Rate Notes will constitute Additional Euro Fixed Rate Notes under the Indenture. The
New Euro Fixed Rate Notes constitute a further issuance of the Issuer’s outstanding Existing Euro Fixed Rate
Notes and are intended to be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Existing Euro Fixed Rate
Notes. The Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes and any Additional Euro Fixed Rate
Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as
otherwise provided in the Indenture.

The New Floating Rate Notes will constitute Additional Floating Rate Notes under the Indenture. The New
Floating Rate Notes constitute a further issuance of the Issuer’s outstanding Existing Floating Rate Notes and are
intended to be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Existing Floating Rate Notes. The Existing
Floating Rate Notes, the New Floating Rate Notes and any Additional Floating Rate Notes subsequently issued
under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in the
Indenture.

The New Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the New Floating Rate Notes offered hereby in reliance on Rule 144A
will have the same international securities identification numbers (“ISINs”) and common codes as, and will be
fungible with, the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, sold in
reliance on Rule 144A immediately upon issuance. The New Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the New Floating Rate
Notes offered hereby in reliance on Regulation S will initially be issued bearing temporary ISINs and temporary
common codes that differ from the ISINs and common codes under which the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes
and the Existing Floating Rate Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S were issued. On and from the earlier of 40
days after the later of the Issue Date and the earliest date or dates permitted under U.S. federal securities laws,
the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the New Floating Rate Notes offered hereby in reliance on Regulation S will
be consolidated and will become fungible with the Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Floating
Rate Notes, as applicable, sold in reliance on Regulation S for trading purposes and thereafter such New Euro
Fixed Rate Notes and New Floating Rate Notes will trade under the same ISINs and common codes as such
Existing Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Existing Floating Rate Notes sold in reliance on Regulation S.

Unless the context otherwise requires or is otherwise clear from context, in this “Description of the Notes,”
the “Issuer” refers only to Selecta Group B.V., and any successor obligor to Selecta Group B.V. in respect of the
Notes, and not to any of its subsidiaries or to its parent.

The proceeds of the offering of the New Notes will be used by the Issuer to: (i) repay all amounts
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) fund excess cash on balance sheet for general corporate
purposes, and (iii) pay estimated fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing, as set forth under the
caption “Use of Proceeds.”

160


-----

The New Notes will be issued in private transactions that are not subject to the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” The terms of the New Notes include those stated in the Indenture.
The registered Holder of a New Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Indenture is not qualified under, does not incorporate provisions by reference to, and is not
otherwise subject to, the Trust Indenture Act. The New Notes are subject to all the provisions of the Indenture,
and Holders of the Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents (as
defined below) and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) and does not purport to be complete
and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture, the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, respectively. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the
information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement in their entirety. Copies of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as described
under “Available Information.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under
“Certain Definitions.”

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The New Notes_**

The New Notes will:

   - be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the New Notes (including, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the obligations of the Issuer under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, and certain other future indebtedness permitted to be
incurred under the Indenture);

   - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is subordinated in right of payment
to the New Notes;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
subsidiaries (including obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by property or assets that do not
constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness;

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Issuer
(including obligations to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the New Notes;

   - be Guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis;

   - mature on February 1, 2024; and

   - be represented by one or more registered New Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may
be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). See “Book-Entry; Delivery and
_Form.”_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the New Notes will receive proceeds from
the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of
payment to the New Notes, except that the Intercreditor Agreement provides that on an enforcement of the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals, the Holders of the New Notes will receive proceeds from such
enforcement only after (i) the Revolving Credit Facility, (ii) certain Hedging Obligations and (iii) other
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a super senior priority basis under the Indenture have been repaid in
full. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Definitions—Permitted
_Collateral Liens.”_

**_The Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the New Notes will be Guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis. In
addition, if required by the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other

161


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Guarantee (as defined below) in the future. Each Guarantee of each of the
Guarantors will:

   - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “Security”;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with all of that Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is not
subordinated in right of payment to its Guarantee (including, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, its
Guarantee granted under the Existing Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain
Hedging Obligations, if any);

   - rank senior in right of payment to all of that Guarantor’s future debt that is subordinated in right of
payment to its Guarantee;

   - rank effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured debt of that Guarantor, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor (including
obligations to trade creditors) that is secured by property or assets that do not constitute Collateral, to
the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligations or indebtedness; and

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of that Guarantor’s subsidiaries (including
obligations to trade creditors) that do not guarantee the Notes.

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue € million in aggregate principal amount of New Euro Fixed Rate Notes and
€ million in aggregate principal amount of New Floating Rate Notes on the Issue Date. The New Notes
will mature on February 1, 2024. The New Notes will be issued in global form in denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day or a business day at the place
at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due
until the next succeeding Business Day (or business day at such place, as the case may be), and will not be
entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the New Notes to receive the payments on such New Notes
are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Interest**

**_Interest on the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of 5[7]/8% per annum and will be payable, in
cash, semi-annually in arrears on October 1 and April 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2020. Interest on
the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such New Euro Fixed Rate Notes on
the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been
paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a
360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each Interest Period (as defined below) shall end on (but not
include) the relevant interest payment date.

**_Interest on the New Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the New Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal
outstanding on the New Floating Rate Notes (the “Euro Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR
plus 5.375%, as determined by an agent appointed by the Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the
Indenture (the “Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch.

Interest on the New Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on April 1, July 1, October 1
and January 2 of each year, commencing on January 2, 2020. If a particular interest payment date is not a
Business Day, then the payment date will move to the next Business Day. Therefore the Interest Period will be
one or more days longer. The Issuer will pay interest to the holders of record of such New Floating Rate Notes on
the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date. Interest on the New Floating Rate
Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from
the date of original issuance.

162


-----

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination
Date, determine the Euro Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the New
Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will
be calculated by applying the Euro Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the New Floating Rate Notes
outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of
days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365; provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of New
Floating Rate Notes outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards
(e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or
resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded
upwards). The determination of the Euro Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent
shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Trustee and the
Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any
calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the holder of any New Floating Rate Notes, provide
the interest rate then in effect with respect to the New Floating Rate Notes. The rights of holders of beneficial
interests in the New Floating Rate Notes to receive the payments of interest on the New Floating Rate Notes will
be subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The Euro
Applicable Rate on the New Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation
of interest on the Floating Rate Notes:

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for
deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the
Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the
Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page
EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the
principal London office of each of four major banks in the eurozone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer,
to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the eurozone inter-bank market for deposits in a
Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest
Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the
Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate
(expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination
Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such
rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two
such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the
immediately preceding Interest Period.

“eurozone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on
but excluding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall
commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude April 1, 2020, with respect to the New Euro
Fixed Rate Notes, and January 2, 2020, with respect to the New Floating Rate Notes.

“Representative Amount” means an amount of at least €1.0 million.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may
replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, Bloomberg page “EBF” or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

163


-----

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the headings
“Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” the Issuer is
permitted to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except in respect
of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (as defined below) supplied to
the Trustee (“Additional Notes”):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, if
applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date
or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be
payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of
holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which
cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional
Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for
such series.

Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes,”
references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Existing Notes issued on the Original Issue
Date, the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the New Floating Rate Notes to be issued on the Issue Date as well as
any future Additional Notes. Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Notes initially
issued on the Original Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to the
initial Notes, and shall be deemed to form one series.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Global Notes
(as defined below) will be payable through one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to Euroclear or Clearstream, which will credit the account specified by the Holder (being Euroclear and
Clearstream or their nominee).

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents
(as defined below) maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be
paid at the option of the Issuer by bank transfer to the Holder as shown on the register for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See “Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes.”

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes for so long as the
Notes are held in registered form. The Paying Agent is Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain (i) one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and (ii) a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”). The Registrar is Elavon Financial Services DAC and the Transfer Agent is Elavon Financial

164


-----

Services DAC, UK Branch. The Paying Agent, Registrar and the Transfer Agent, as applicable, will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and will make
payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. The Transfer Agent
shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent
for the Notes without prior notice to the holders of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The New Notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form without
interest coupons, as follows:

   - Each series of the New Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

   - The 144A Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

   - Each series of the New Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes,
the “Global Notes”).

   - The Regulation S Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership
of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” In addition,
transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected
by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules
and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance
with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the New Notes, ownership of Book-Entry Interests in
Regulation S Global Notes will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons
who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons
shall not be permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests (as defined below) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests (as defined below) only upon delivery
by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is
being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities
law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €100,000
aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as

165


-----

applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued
in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer to be in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below.

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, New Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in aggregate
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture requires the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee
at Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any taxes,
duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange
will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in
connection with such transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent will be entitled to treat the
Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In the circumstances
described below under “Certain Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate
Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to any of the restrictive or affirmative covenants in the Indenture.

**Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes, including any payment obligation
resulting from a Change of Control, will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed, jointly and
severally on a senior basis, by the Guarantors (such guarantee, a “Guarantee”). The Guarantors will grant the
Guarantees and have also granted a senior guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

In addition, as described below under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that in the
future guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement any other Credit Facility that is Incurred under clause
(1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
or Public Debt in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall, subject in each case to the Agreed Security
Principles, also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference,
“thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters.

Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations
subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles
to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral.”_

The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon:

   - a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or
amalgamation) of ownership interests in the relevant Guarantor (directly or through a Holding
Company of such Guarantor) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate
the Indenture;

166


-----

   - the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

   - defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction
_and Discharge”;_

   - as described in the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”;_

   - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below);

   - as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

   - with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant
consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors” and the Indenture;_

   - with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to
which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor; or

   - upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Notes.

Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of
non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and
guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the
claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes. The Notes and each
Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and
minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, to the extent of the assets of
such Subsidiaries. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and after giving effect to the
transactions described under “Use of Proceeds” (the “Refinancing”), the Guarantors accounted for approximately
97.7% of the consolidated total assets, approximately 89.8% of the consolidated revenue (before the impact of
vending fee harmonization) and approximately 88.8% of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2019, after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have
had no material third-party debt outstanding (excluding financial leases and factoring arrangements). Although
the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not
impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

**The Proceeds Loans**

On or about the Original Issue Date, the Issuer lent, pursuant to two or more proceeds loans (the “Proceeds
_Loans”), a portion of the net proceeds of the issuance of the Existing Notes to Selecta AG. The Proceeds Loan_
(and any subsequent intragroup loans) are subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the Guarantees
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer granted a first-priority security interest in respect of the
receivables under the Proceeds Loan to secure the Notes. See “Security.”

It is anticipated that funds received by the Issuer as payments of interest under the Proceeds Loans will be
used to service a portion of the interest payments under the Notes. As the aggregate principal amount of the
Proceeds Loan is lower than that of the Notes, the Proceeds Loans may have a variable interest rate that allows
for higher interest payments from time to time and the principal on the Proceeds Loan may be repaid in order to
service interest payments on the Notes. In addition, subsidiaries of the Issuer may upstream further funds as
needed by means of dividends or loans.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, pursuant to the Security Documents, the Issuer, MidCo and certain subsidiaries of MidCo
will grant in favor of the Security Agent liens and security interests on an equal and ratable first-priority basis,
subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements and any Permitted
Collateral Liens, over certain of their assets, as listed below:

   - Dutch law share pledge over the shares in the Issuer;

167


-----

   - Dutch law intra-group receivables pledge or assignment by way of security in respect of loans or other
receivables owed by the Issuer to MidCo;

   - Dutch law bank account pledge of the material bank accounts of the Issuer;

   - Dutch law intra-group receivables pledge or assignment by way of security in respect of loans or other
structural intragroup receivables owed by Subsidiaries of the Issuer to the Issuer;

   - Swiss law share pledge over the shares in Selecta AG;

   - Swiss law share pledge over the shares in Selecta TMP AG;

   - share pledge over the other Guarantors; and

   - pledge or security of certain structural intercompany receivables (excluding any receivables arising
from any intercompany trading),

(together, the “Collateral”).

In addition, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, each
subsidiary of the Issuer that accedes to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement as a guarantor thereof after the
Issue Date and grants security in connection with such accession shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as
a Guarantor with respect to the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement, and security will be granted in
favor of the Notes over the assets that will secure the Revolving Credit Facility. The Collateral will be pledged
pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes and holders of
the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future
be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute
“Collateral.” All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which
include, among others:

   - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other
competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination,
“transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and
other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity
impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries
(collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or
security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited
accordingly; provided that to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable
security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors
(exercised for a specific period but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security
document shall be subject to such limit;

   - the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility,
stamp duty, registration taxes, guarantee fees payable to persons that are not members of the Group,
notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) related to granting the relevant guarantee and/or security
(including in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) will not be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties of obtaining such guarantee or
security;

   - the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease,
license, instrument or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from
being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a
consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if
subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise
amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the
asset or require the relevant charger to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group

168


-----

or any member thereof; provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to
obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the
Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is
material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not reasonably be expected to adversely
impact relationships with third parties;

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security
documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal
capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory
duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or
restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any
director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the
Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession document, the relevant
member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without
adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such
guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the Security
Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security
documents for all the secured creditors); provided that it shall be permissible to use “parallel debt”
provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the
individual security documents); and furthermore, the agreement that no member of the Group shall be
required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or
transfer of the Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and
like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Issuer and the Security Agent, and the agreement that where a class of assets to be secured
includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is
disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third
party (subject to certain exceptions) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and
such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant security document);

- the acknowledgement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or
sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantees and that security will not be required
from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any
member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group;

- that agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (including dealing with
the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing
to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Event of Default which is
continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek
consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to the Agreed Security
Principles; and

- the agreement that guarantees and security are only to be given by material subsidiaries which are
incorporated in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom and any jurisdiction in which a borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is
incorporated and not in any other jurisdiction (each such other jurisdiction, an “Excluded Jurisdiction”)
and no security or guarantees shall be required to be given by members of the Group incorporated in
Excluded Jurisdictions or by (or over the shares or investments in) any joint venture or similar
arrangement, any minority interest, or (unless it is a borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement), any non-wholly owned member of the Group.

169


-----

The assets that comprise the Collateral also secure on a first-priority (to the extent possible) basis the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain Hedging Obligations. However, pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral only after the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be
incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture on a super senior priority basis, if any, have been repaid in full.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” MidCo, the Issuer_
and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future
issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as
permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The proceeds of any enforcement over Collateral
will be applied to discharge all liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
hedging obligations and any other super priority status indebtedness and, once such obligations have been fully
discharged, will be applied pro rata in repayment of liabilities under the Notes, the Indenture and other pari
_passu indebtedness of the Issuer or the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral_
pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or
imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the New Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_
_obligations under the Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances.”_

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Security Documents and the Collateral will be administered by the Security Agent, in each case
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. In addition, in
certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests,
the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured
obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. The
enforcement of the Security Documents is subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For
a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law
limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral
will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate
benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect
to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as_
_favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are_
_familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance_
_statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, MidCo, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Collateral
provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the
Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest
and dispose of any income therefrom.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with
the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes, the payment of obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any Hedging Obligations. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral
will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that
the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all.

170


-----

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability of the
Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some
or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Trustee for the Notes has, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:

   - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents);

   - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to
which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and

   - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and
the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the Collateral as between (a) the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and other future indebtedness (b) the counterparties under certain hedging arrangements, and
(c) the Trustee and the holders of the Notes under the Indenture, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide that the obligations under the Notes, the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and such hedging arrangements will receive proceeds of enforcement of security over
the Collateral equally and ratably on a first priority basis, provided that obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, certain other future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture on a super
priority basis and such hedging arrangements will be repaid prior to the Notes with the proceeds of any
enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition,
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date,
the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. Under certain circumstances, the creditors under
such Indebtedness will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes under the Indenture or may have a competing claim not subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement. See “—Release of Liens,” “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent will take any action necessary and reasonably required by, and at the cost of, the Issuer
to effectuate any release of Collateral required by a Security Document in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement:

(1) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued under the
Indenture or satisfaction and discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance with the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral, directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person other
than MidCo, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to
“Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”) if such sale or other disposition does not violate the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is
otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in a manner
consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, as described in the second paragraph of the covenant
described below under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(6) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

171


-----

(7) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance with the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”;

(8) with respect to assets held by or the Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary, in connection with a solvent
liquidation of such Restricted Subsidiary, pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(9) if on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, including under the covenant described under
“Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

Each of these releases shall be effected by the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary, the
Trustee, without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to
request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstances give rise to the release of Collateral and that such release complies with the Indenture. MidCo will
be entitled to release the security interests in respect of the Collateral owned by it under the circumstances
described in clauses (1), (4), (6), (9) and (10) of the preceding paragraph. Additionally, the Security Interests in
any Collateral owned by MidCo will be released to the extent necessary in connection with a sale, assignment or
transfer by MidCo of the Capital Stock of the Issuer in a manner that would constitute a Change of Control or a
Change of Control Triggering Event; provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default is caused by such
transaction and (ii) the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition is made
accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and either accedes to the
Security Documents to which MidCo is a party or enters into new Security Documents pursuant to which the
Collateral previously held by MidCo is pledged in favor of the Notes.

MidCo, the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Collateral provider may also, among other
things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to the Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling, pledging or otherwise disposing of, in any
transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security Documents which
has become worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or useful in the business; (ii) selling, pledging,
transferring or otherwise disposing of current assets in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) any other action
permitted by the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement.

In the event of a conflict between the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or such Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as the case may be) will prevail. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by MidCo, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the request of the Issuer,
enter into with MidCo, the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such Indebtedness (or
their duly authorized representatives), as applicable, one or more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a
restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an “Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not_
materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes as compared to the Intercreditor Agreement) and
substantially similar as applies to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security, priority and
release of security; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnification or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee and the Security Agent such
documentation in relation thereto as it may reasonably require. As used herein, a reference to the Intercreditor
Agreement will also include any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant
described herein under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also provides that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of holders of
the Notes, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any

172


-----

Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement,
(2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such Intercreditor Agreement that may be
Incurred by MidCo, the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries that is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement
(provided that such Indebtedness is Incurred in compliance with the Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes),
(5) make provision to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, or
(6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders of Notes in any
material respect.

The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted
by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee
or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and
accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the
future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to
enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available to
the holders of the Notes upon request and will be made available for inspection during normal business hours on
any Business Day upon prior written request at the office of the Issuer.

**IPO Pushdown**

(1) On, in contemplation of, or following an IPO Event, the Issuer shall be entitled to require (by written notice
to the Trustee and the Security Agent (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date
specified in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that: (i) references to the Issuer and Restricted
Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Pushdown Entity and its Restricted
Subsidiaries from time to time, although the Issuer shall remain the same entity; (ii) all financial ratio,
basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown
Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity (or the Issuer,
if so elected); (iii) each reference in the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) to the “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to
the extent applicable and unless the context requires otherwise, and provided further that nothing in this
paragraph (1), including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub-paragraph (iii) and any action
taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior to it being deemed to be the Issuer, shall, or shall be deemed to,
directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in the indenture or a
Default or an Event of Default); (iv) none of the representations, warranties, undertakings, covenants or
Events of Default in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
or the Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity is a Subsidiary
(whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any
Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall,
or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term in
the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by any such Holding
Company; and (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Issuer: (A) each person which is party to the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an “Investor” shall be irrevocably
and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
and all obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) (and from the date specified by the Issuer that person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and shall have no further rights or
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor);
and (B) there shall be no obligation or requirement for any person to become party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor unless such Person is the lender

-----

under any Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the IPO Pushdown Entity or its Subsidiaries which are
Restricted Subsidiaries; and (viii) in the event that any person is released from or does not become party to
the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor as a consequence of
this paragraph (1), any term of the indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or assumes that any person be an Investor or that any liabilities or
obligations to such person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. A Pushdown Notice may not be delivered if a
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (disregarding any Default or Event of Default
that could be deemed to arise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this provision).

(2) The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Indenture or
amendment to or replacement of the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or
the Security Documents required by the Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Issuer in
order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by paragraph (1) above; provided that such
amendment, replacement or other document or instrument does not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent (as applicable), does not
affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent (as
applicable) under such amendment, replacement or other document or instrument. The Trustee and the
Security Agent are each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders (without any consent by the
Holders) to execute any such amended or replacement documents and/or take other such action on behalf of
the Holders (and shall do so on the request of and at the cost of the Issuer).

(3) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted Subsidiary notified to
the Trustee by the Issuer in writing as the person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the
relevant IPO Event, provided that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary which will issue
shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO Event (or a Holding Company of such Restricted
Subsidiary).

(4) If the Issuer delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee and Security Agent pursuant to paragraph (1) above
in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior
to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event by written notice to the Trustee and Security Agent. In the event
that any Pushdown Notice is revoked in accordance with this paragraph (4): (i) the provisions of
sub-paragraphs (1)(i) to (1)(vii) above shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown Notice; (ii) if any
security has been released pursuant to paragraph (1) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably
practicable execute a replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any person party
to the Intercreditor Agreement as an “Investor” has been released from the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant
to sub-paragraph (1)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown Notice, if required by the Trustee by prior
written notice to the Issuer and that person, that person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in this paragraph (4) shall prohibit or otherwise restrict the Issuer
from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or contemplated IPO Event; and
(B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or
result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or a Default or an Event of Default (whether by reason
of any action or step taken by any person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed, while that
Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion of any such
Equity Offering.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “Selection and Notice” below. Any redemption and
notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control
or any other transaction). In addition, if such redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice may state that, at the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice
may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date,
or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10
days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of Notes of not less

175


-----

than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw
such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right upon not less than ten nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days
following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or
incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

We may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar, as applicable,
will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if
any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar, as applicable,
by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Notes are not so
listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through Euroclear or
Clearstream or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribe no method of selection, on a pro rata basis or by use of a pool
factor; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in
part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor
the Registrar will be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days
prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the
relevant Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change in the
principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any
conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem at its discretion the Notes of a series in whole, but not in part, at any time upon
giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as
defined below under “Withholding Taxes”), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption

176


-----

Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Issuer or a Guarantor determine in good faith that,
as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment
or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or Guarantor are, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay
any Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable
measures available to the Issuer or Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new
Paying Agent where this would be reasonable but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment
with respect to the Notes). In the case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in
Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the 2018 Offering Memorandum,
such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of the 2018 Offering Memorandum. In the
case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that
becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the 2018 Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax
Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless
the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of a Successor Company (as defined below) or the
predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in
accordance with the procedures described under “Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as
defined below) would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the
Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional
Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Issuer or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, will deliver to the Trustee
and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer or Guarantor, or a successor to either,
where applicable, is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of a tax counsel of
recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or Guarantor, or a successor to either, where applicable, has or
have been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee
and the Paying Agent will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to the Issuer is
incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or
through which such successor makes any payment on the Notes or any Guarantees, and any political subdivision
or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer or a Guarantor (a “Payor”) on the Notes or the Guarantees will be made
free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made by the Payor or its
agents, or any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause
(1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made by a Payor with respect to any Note or Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay (together with
such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by each Holder after such withholding or deduction (including any
such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been

177


-----

received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account
of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the
relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national or
domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically
present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from
the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the
Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after
reasonable notice, to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the Holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(5) where such withholding or deduction is required pursuant to section 1471(b) of the Code (or an amended or
successor version that is substantially comparable) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through
1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version that is substantially comparable), any regulations or
agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof, or any similar law or regulation implementing an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States relating thereto;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Note presented for payment (where presentation is permitted or
required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid
such Taxes by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another paying agent;
or

(7) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant payment was first made
available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses
(1) to (7) inclusive above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary
or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes
would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner
held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor and will provide such certified
copies to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon
request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on
any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee

178


-----

and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts
to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45
days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying
Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture, the Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in
any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other property or
similar taxes, charges or levies, that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or
enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (other than in connection with a transfer or exchange of the Notes), excluding any such Taxes, charges or
levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, and the Issuer agrees to indemnify
the Holders for any such Taxes paid by such Holders. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will survive
any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in
which any successor to the Issuer is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof
or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture provides that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a
change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently
therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “Optional
_Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or_
in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of Notes denominated in euros and CHF 150,000 in
principal amount or in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the CHF Notes; provided
that Notes denominated in euros of €100,000 or less in principal amount and CHF Notes of CHF 150,000 or less
in principal amount may only be purchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the
“Change of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within
60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a
notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering
Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice,
which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described
below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
compliance therewith. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of
the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under
“Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date

179


-----

that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice of the Change of Control Offer to each
Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of
such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right
of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change
_of Control Payment”);_

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow
in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the
extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so
tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount
of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order
to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by
the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for
cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering
Event may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain
events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself
does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase
feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and,
thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a
result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the

180


-----

consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may
afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise
in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by
the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or
(ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under
“Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the
applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a
particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event
has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above will in such
circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the Issuer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the
rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer may issue Disqualified
Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the date of such Incurrence and
after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Issuer is at least 2.00 to 1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility (including
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility) in a maximum
aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) the greater of (a)
€200.0 million and (b) 69.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer, in each case, at any one time
outstanding; provided, that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any

permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the aggregate
principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to
pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs,
indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing);

Subsidiary in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of
the Indenture; or

Restricted Subsidiary, in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under
the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

Guarantor or the Issuer, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to prior payment
in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration or otherwise) and the performance in full of
its obligations under the Indenture to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes) and any Guarantees thereof,
(b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (3) of this paragraph) of the

this covenant, (d) other Indebtedness in respect of Management Advances; (e) the Proceeds Loans; and
(f) Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Restricted Subsidiaries or the Argenta Group outstanding as of the Issue
Date or Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect as of the Issue Date, in either case, in respect of
factoring financings, securitizations, receivables financings or similar arrangements;

(5) Indebtedness (i) of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or
otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related
liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred
to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which a Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, with respect to each of clause (5)(i) and (5)(ii), that
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (5) is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (a) the greater of
(x) €45.0 million and (y) 16.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer at the time of Incurrence, plus
(b) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving effect to any such acquisition or other

additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or, if such Indebtedness is Senior
Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer would be no
greater than 4.25 to 1.00, in each case after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to
this sub-clause (5)(b) or (II) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be lower or, if
such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of
the Issuer, would not be greater, in each case, than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging Agreements
entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for
speculative purposes;

Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or
cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used in a Similar Business or

Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets, and in each case any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

(1) in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock meets
the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this
covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first
paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by
reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision
and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; provided that any
amounts Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant, including any amounts incurred
under the Revolving Credit Facility, may not be reclassified;

(2) with respect to any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a clause limited by a fixed euro amount in the second
paragraph of this covenant, if at any time that the Issuer would be entitled to have Incurred any then
outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness
shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant;

(3) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down”

184


-----

provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be
repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date
such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such Indebtedness,
such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and
expenses, including any premium (including tender premiums) and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (8), (10), (11) or
(14) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not
be included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of
a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase
price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(8) the amount of Indebtedness shall be calculated as described under the definition of “Indebtedness”;

(9) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any
Lien pursuant to clause (25) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all
purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for
borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount
thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,
and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied
with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation
of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective
of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any
borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
(the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of
credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved
Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the
extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be
Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed
pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Issuer may revoke such
determination at any time and from time to time;

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated
based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of
such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced,
and giving effect to the manner of measurement described in clause (4) of this paragraph; and

(11) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to
the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

185


-----

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends
in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments
or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is
not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, it shall constitute a default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced after giving effect to the manner of
measurement described in clause (4) of the third paragraph of this covenant; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the
aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Original Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Original Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as
any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such
Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under
such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any
premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Issuer’s or any Restricted
Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation

Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

from such Indebtedness are contributed to the equity of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any
form or otherwise received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (a “Parent Debt Contribution”);
(y) any net proceeds described in clause (x) above shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the
amount available for distribution pursuant to clause (c) of the second half of this paragraph and clauses
(1) or (10) of the third paragraph of this covenant, and shall not be Excluded Contributions or Excluded
Amounts; and (z) in the case that any net proceeds described in subclause (x) above are contributed to
the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries in the form of Indebtedness, there shall be no double-counting
of interest paid on such Indebtedness and any dividends or distributions payable to the relevant Parent

otherwise have occurred without the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, property or assets or marketable
securities did not occur and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such event in accordance
with the requirements of the Indenture.

Taxes, unless otherwise required by Dutch tax rules in respect of a fiscal unity, the amount of any such

thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with
this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any
cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment
shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

MidCo will not, the Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), whether owned on the Original Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any
interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the
“Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted
Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a
Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are secured equally and ratably with (or prior to, in the case of
Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness) such Indebtedness for so long as such Indebtedness is so
secured and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture pursuant to clause (a)(2) of
the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release
and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) or (b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any
other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Original Issue Date or on any
applicable Target Accession Date or Post-Closing Date (in each case, as defined in the Indenture);

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was acquired by

designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a
Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined
with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if another Person is the
Successor Company, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such
Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such
Person becomes the Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material
respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial
Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that
is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or
other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the Indenture or
securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Indenture to the

mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease Obligations

acquired or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions
on the transfer of the assets of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or assets)
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all
or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that
are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements and
instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or Commodity
Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Original Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement, together with the Security Documents associated therewith as in effect on the Original Issue

Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or where in the case of this
sub clause (ii), either (x) the Issuer determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances
or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of
a default relating to such agreement or instrument;

(12) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”; or

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Receivables Facility that, in
the good faith determination of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified Receivables
Financing or such Receivables Facility.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at
least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition
(excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise (provided that the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries are released from
such liabilities), other than Indebtedness) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the
terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 365 days from the later of
(A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided,
_however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to_
this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) (except in the case of any revolving Indebtedness including, but not
limited to, the Revolving Credit Facility) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari passu Indebtedness at a
price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari passu Indebtedness plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment or purchase; provided that the Issuer shall
redeem, repay or repurchase Pari passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt pursuant to this clause
(ii) only if the Issuer either (A) reduces the aggregate principal amount of the Notes on an equal or
ratable basis with any such Pari passu Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause (ii) by, at its option,
(x) redeeming Notes as provided under “Optional Redemption” and/or (y) purchasing Notes through
open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below
par) and/or (B) makes (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the
Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset
Disposition Offer on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari passu Indebtedness repaid pursuant to
this clause (ii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for purposes hereof); (iii)
to purchase Notes through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market
prices (which may be below par); (iv) to make (at such time or subsequently in compliance with this
covenant) an offer to the Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth
below for an Asset Disposition Offer (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Disposition Offer for
purposes hereof) or (v) to redeem any series of Notes as described under “Optional Redemption”; or

(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) within 365 days
from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;
_provided, however, that any such investment in Additional Assets made pursuant to a definitive binding_
agreement or a commitment that is executed or approved within such time will satisfy this requirement,
so long as such investment is consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that any such capital expenditure
made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or a commitment that is executed or approved within
such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such capital expenditure is consummated within 180
days of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing,

_provided that, (1) pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a) or_
clause (b) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise
invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture, and (2) the Issuer (or any
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may elect to invest in Additional Assets prior to receiving the Net
Available Cash attributable to any given Asset Disposition (provided that such investment shall be made no
earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition, execution of a definitive
agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant Asset Disposition) and deem the
amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with clause (b) above with respect to such Asset
Disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of
any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to
comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and
corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of
any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) would result in material adverse Tax
consequences to the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion,
the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this
covenant.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied
or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the
Indenture. On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, or at such earlier date that the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of (i) €30.0 million and (ii) 11% of
Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer, and has not been committed in accordance with clause (3)(b) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders
of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari
_passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari passu_
Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at
an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari passu Indebtedness, at an
offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal amount of such
_Pari passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of_
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari
_passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in_
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate
Notes and CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the CHF Notes.

Any Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes pursuant to this covenant will be allocated between
the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Floating Rate Notes and the CHF Notes in proportion to the respective aggregate
principal amounts of Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Floating Rate Notes and the CHF Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes,
the Floating Rate Notes and the CHF Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the
relevant Euro Fixed Rate Notes, Floating Rate Notes and CHF Notes are denominated, respectively, the amount
thereof payable in respect of such Euro Fixed Rate Notes, Floating Rate Notes and CHF Notes shall not exceed
the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Euro Fixed Rate Notes, Floating Rate Notes and CHF

195


-----

Notes, as the case may be, are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary upon
converting such portion into such currency.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to the other covenants contained
in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and other Pari passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari passu
Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts
into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall
be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount
thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such
Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than
five Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
_Date”), the Issuer will purchase (or procure the purchase of) the aggregate principal amount of Notes and, to the_
extent they elect, Pari passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all_
Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment,
on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes and such Pari passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes and
CHF 150,000 and in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof with respect to the CHF Notes. The Issuer
will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for
payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase
price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for
purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the Global Note), and the Trustee (or its
authenticating agent), upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or
deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Note to such Holder, in an aggregate principal
amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in
an aggregate principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000 with respect to the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes and the Floating Rate Notes and CHF 150,000 with respect to the CHF Notes. Any Note not so accepted
will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the release of the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from
the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any
Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

196


-----

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after
the Original Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of
€50.0 million and 18.0% of Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are then listed) in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached
its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into
or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate value in excess of €20.0 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction
in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €30.0 million, the terms of
such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b) of the second paragraph_
of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other
than Permitted Investments described in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other payments,
awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering into, or
maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements to purchase
Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Holding Company restricted stock
plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee
benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance,
retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of
officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of
business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including
under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of,
directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Holding
Company (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of
such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the 2018 Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Argenta Acquisition) and the entry into
and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any
transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or

197

instrument in effect as of or on the Original Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be
amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with
the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection
with any Public Offering;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and maintenance
of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary
course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in
the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the Senior Management of the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained
at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction
solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such
Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of
the Issuer or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of
such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Issuer in their reasonable determination and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction
with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the
Indenture;

related expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed, in each calendar year that has commenced since the
Original Issue Date, beginning on the Original Issue Date, €2.0 million and (b) customary payments by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including
through any Parent Holding Company) for financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or
placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with
acquisitions or divestitures, which payments in respect of this clause (b) are approved by a majority of the
Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted
Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

(13) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Receivables Facility;

(14) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in connection
with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted Subsidiary permitted
under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or entered into with any Business Successor,
in each case, that the Issuer determines in good faith is either fair to the Issuer or otherwise on customary
terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions; and

(15) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee a
letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (1) of the preceding
paragraph.

**_Reports_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each of the Issuer’s fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2019, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information:
(a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the most recent two fiscal years and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most two recent

198


-----

fiscal years, including customary footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent
auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and balance
sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full
income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
and capital resources of the Issuer, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical
accounting policies, with a similar scope to that included in the 2018 Offering Memorandum; (d) a
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions
and a description of all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a
description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters of the Issuer beginning with the quarter
ending December 31, 2019, all quarterly reports of the Issuer containing the following information: (a) an
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as of the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent quarter year-to-date period
ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period of the Issuer,
together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of
a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the relevant quarter; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and material
changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer, and a discussion of material changes not in the
ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material
recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring or any senior
executive officer changes at the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer or any other material event that the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of such
event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in
effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on
a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and
(3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such
periods. Except as provided for in this covenant, no report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Issuer. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 20-F within the time period specified in
(1) will satisfy such provision. At the Issuer’s election it may also include financial statements of a Parent
Holding Company in lieu of those for the Issuer; provided that, if the financial statements of a Parent Holding
Company are included in such report, a reasonably detailed description of material differences between the
financial statements of the Parent Holding Company and the Issuer shall be included for any period after the
Issue Date.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or
business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s pro forma total revenue or reported
EBITDA or total assets as of and for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this covenant shall include (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) standalone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited
reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries.

199


-----

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports or statement specified in clauses
(1), (2) and (3) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall also (a) use its
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports or statement on such website as may be then
maintained by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of
such reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer determines in good faith
that it cannot make such reports or statement available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing
to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports or statement to the
Holders and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. The Issuer will also make available copies of all
reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant, if and for so long as the Notes
are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer
shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required
to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for information
purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein,
including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all
its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union or the United States of America, any
State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (in each case subject to
any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security Principles) (a) by supplemental indenture, executed
and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and (b) all obligations of the
Issuer under the Security Documents (and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement);

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur
at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Successor Company would
not be greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such consolidation, merger or transfer complies with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in
the Indenture relating to such consolidation, merger or transfer have been satisfied and that the Indenture,
the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Issuer enforceable in accordance with their terms. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate without independent verification.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to
be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be
deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For the purpose of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

200


-----

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this
covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted
Subsidiary and (c) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake the 2018 Transactions.
Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to the transactions referred to in this
sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant)
will not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

No Guarantor that is a Subsidiary of the Issuer (a “Subsidiary Guarantor”) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person;

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor,

unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor (or becomes a Guarantor
concurrently with the transaction); or

(B)

(1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
expressly assumes (in each case subject to any limitations contemplated by the Agreed Security
Principles) all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Security Documents
(and, to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement); and

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of
the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each
case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B) and the provisions described above under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer” (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (a) any Restricted_
Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and
assets to a Subsidiary Guarantor, (b) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Subsidiary Guarantor and (c) the
Subsidiary Guarantors may undertake the 2018 Transactions. Notwithstanding the preceding clause B(2) (which
does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or
otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the
legal domicile of the Subsidiary Guarantor reincorporating the Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, or
changing the legal form of the Subsidiary Guarantor.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Original Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day

201


-----

and continuing until the Reversion Date, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following
captions will not apply to such Notes: “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”
“—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions,” “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock,” “—Additional Guarantees” and the_
provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation—
_The Issuer,” and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will_
not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions
will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect.
Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the
continuance of the Suspension Event, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be
interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of such indenture except that no default will be deemed to
have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the
Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be classified, at
the Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the
extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving
effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the
extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on
the Original Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions
under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of
the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to notify Holders of such event.

**_Limited Condition Acquisition and Irrevocable Repayment_**

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of
Control or Irrevocable Repayment, for purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture
which requires that no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result
from any such action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed satisfied, so long
as no Default or Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the Definitive Agreements for such Limited
Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment is entered into after giving pro forma effect
to the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the Issuer has exercised its option under the first sentence of this paragraph, and any Default or Event
of Default occurs following the date the Definitive Agreement for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition,
Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment was entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment, any such Default or Event of Default shall
be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in
connection with such Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment is permitted
hereunder.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of
Control or Irrevocable Repayment for purposes of:

(1) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires the calculation of the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio; or

(2) testing baskets set forth in the Indenture,

in each case, at the option of the Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in connection with any
Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment, an “LCA Election”), the date of
determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder, may be deemed to be the date the Definitive
Agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment is entered into
(the “LCA Test Date”). If, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control
or Irrevocable Repayment and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most
recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the LCA Test Date for which consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer are available, the Issuer could have taken such action on the relevant LCA Test Date in
compliance with such ratio or basket, such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.

202


-----

If the Issuer has made an LCA Election, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or
basket availability with respect to the Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, or the making of Asset Dispositions,
mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, the
designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the determination of whether or not a Change of Control Triggering
Event has occurred, on or following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such
Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment is consummated or the Definitive
Agreement for such Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment is terminated
or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable
Repayment, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Condition
Acquisition, Change of Control or Irrevocable Repayment and other transactions in connection therewith
(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. If the Issuer
has made an LCA Election and any of the ratios or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of
the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio or basket, including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Acquisition, Change of
Control or Irrevocable Repayment, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such
baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

The Issuer will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, directly or
indirectly, to Guarantee any Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (or any other Credit
Facility that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness”) any Public Debt and any refinancing thereof, or any other third-party Indebtedness of the_
Issuer or a Guarantor in excess of €35.0 million in principal amounts, in whole or in part unless, in each case but
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor on the date on which
such other Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture
in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee,
which Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness.

A Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor may become a Guarantor if it executes and delivers to the
Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Guarantee.

Future Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “Guarantees.” A
Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there
is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Original Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor
were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all
necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any
release of a Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications.

Each additional Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause any Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Notes or provide security to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any violation of applicable law or regulation; (2) any
liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and other than reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any
measures pursuant to clause (1) of this paragraph undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which in any
case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this paragraph cannot be avoided through measures reasonably
available to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; or (4) an inconsistency with the Intercreditor Agreement or the

203


-----

Agreed Security Principles. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests and the
liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on_
_the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

MidCo and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or
knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the security
interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, or the
confirmation or affirmation of security interests in respect of the Collateral, shall under no circumstances be
deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and
the Holders, and MidCo and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien over any of the Collateral that is prohibited by the
covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens”; provided, that MidCo, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur any Lien over any of the Collateral that is not prohibited by the covenant entitled “—Limitation on Liens,”
including Permitted Collateral Liens, and the Collateral may be discharged, transferred or released in any
circumstances not prohibited by the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Security
Documents.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this covenant shall restrict the discharge and release of any Lien in
accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the Security Documents
may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets) to (i) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens; (iii) add to the Collateral;
(iv) undertake a Permitted Reorganization or Permitted Tax Restructuring or (v) make any other change thereto
that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; provided, however, that, (except where
permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or to effect or facilitate the creation of Permitted
Collateral Liens for the benefit of the Security Agent and holders of other Indebtedness Incurred in accordance
with the Indenture), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise modified
or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets),
unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement or modification or release
(followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Issuer
delivers to the Security Agent and the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Security Agent and the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor or appraiser or
investment bank of international standing which confirms the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same
asset), (2) a certificate from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the relevant Person which
confirms the solvency of the person granting any such Lien after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification or release, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to
any qualifications customary for this type of Opinion of Counsel), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets), the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, modified or released and replaced are valid and perfected Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or
Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement and to which the new Indebtedness secured by the Permitted Collateral
Lien is not subject.

In the event that MidCo, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries comply with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications)
consent to such actions without the need for instructions from the Holders.

204

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after written notice by the
Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any other agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or
Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at Stated Maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross acceleration
_provision”),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the aggregate
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €35.0 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as
of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €35.0 million (exclusive
of any amounts covered by indemnities provided by a solvent insurance company or that a solvent insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of
60 days after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph after such judgment becomes
final and due, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been
commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment
_default provision”);_

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents on any Collateral having a fair market value in excess of
€15.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms
of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Indenture) for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or
the release or amendment of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or such Security Document or any such
security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or MidCo, the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and
any such Default continues for ten days (the “security default provisions”); and

(8) any Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with
the terms of such Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial
proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Guarantee and any such
Default continues for ten days (the “guarantee provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer
of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such default within the time
specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

205


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the
request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest,
including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and
payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration
of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of
Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the
declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of
Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the
Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal,
premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may
only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or
Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain
_Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the_
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the
Indenture.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability, fees or
expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, fees or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the
offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that,

206


-----

in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has
received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a
prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights
of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to
it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or
interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the
Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required
to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is
aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to
take in respect thereof.

The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only
if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the
Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be
unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover to it, and it
will be for Holders to take action directly.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce
the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes)
and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes);
_provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the_
consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required.
However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of
the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any such series of the Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, waiver or
modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to
Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any such
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “Optional Redemption” or “Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons”;_

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal
of, or interest or Additional Amount, if any, on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the due
dates thereof;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Notes in a

207


-----

way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay
Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken
as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt and without prejudice to the covenant described under the heading “Certain Covenants—Impairment
_of Security Interest,” the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit_
of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with
a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority
in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement;

(10) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in
this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to
receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, MidCo, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the
Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under any
Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in a manner
such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 4701(b)(1)(B) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make any
change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Notes) that does not adversely
affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(6) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional
Notes permitted under the Indenture;

(7) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,”
to add Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm
and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the
Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing the Notes when such release,
termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements
thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;

208


-----

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest in favor
of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, in
any property which is required by the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as in effect on the Original
Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be
granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest for the benefit of any
Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and_
_Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or_

(11) as provided in “Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and rely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The Indenture
does not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all its and each Guarantor’s obligations under any series of the Notes
and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities
and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations
concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the
foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee
and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such
time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the covenants described
under “Certain Covenants” (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under
“Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer” and clause (A), (B) and (C) of the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors”) and “Change of
_Control” and default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the_
operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy
provisions with respect to the Issuer and its Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant
defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
applicable series of Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If
the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to any series of the Notes, payment of such Notes
may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses
(1) and (2) of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer” and
clauses (A), (B), (C) of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—
_Subsidiary Guarantors”), (4), (5), (6) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer)), (7),_
(8) or (9) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
trust”) with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) cash in
euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the applicable series of Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate
Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, or cash in CHF or CHF-denominated Swiss Government
Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the CHF

209


-----

Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including
delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, in their
capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance
of the applicable series of Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further
effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee,
as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for
this purpose), money in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof with respect to the
Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes and money in CHF or CHF-denominated Swiss Government
Obligations with respect to the CHF Notes, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any,
and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the
Indenture to apply the deposited money towards payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as
the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with, provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts
deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however,
that the Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment
date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and
payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative
interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of MidCo, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of MidCo, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture provides that, except
during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written
notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, or
(b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the
Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for
removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture. Each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall be entitled to rely solely and conclusively on any Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel in
formulating its opinion or in taking any action (including, without limitation, release of a Guarantee or
Collateral) under the Indenture, and may rely on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without need
for investigation or verification, except as may otherwise be provided for under the terms of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as
any of the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and for so long as the rules of Authority
shall so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any notice with respect to the Notes. In addition, for so
long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and
Clearstream in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall
be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of BookEntry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with
respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given,
whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given via Euroclear or Clearstream, it
will be deemed to have been duly given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed three years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

211


-----

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the New Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the New Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the New
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the New Notes thereon
will be granted, and settlement of the New Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-denominated and CHF denominated Restrictions**

Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro or CHF, whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer,
any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it in
euro or CHF, as the case may be, from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or
such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the euro or CHF amount, as the case may be, which the recipient is
able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or
recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable
to do so).

If that euro or CHF amount is less than the euro or CHF amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the
Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the
Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used)
the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a
waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Guarantee or to the
Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since, as of the Original Issue Date, substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are held by
Subsidiaries located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or
any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest,
Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes or the
Guarantees, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes and the Guarantees, the Issuer and each Guarantor will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and
State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture is, and the New Notes will be, including any Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the
parties thereunder governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the
avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be amended with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties thereunder are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England.
The Security Documents are, or will be, governed by the law of the location of the relevant asset that is part of
the Collateral.

and has not been replaced) or has caused any Reserved Indebtedness Amount to be deemed to be Incurred during
such period or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the
reference period but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge

Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee,
redemption, defeasance, retirement, extinguishment or other discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance or
redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the

mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to the reference period and on or prior to or

assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and
disposed or discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in
Consolidated EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period. If since the
beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or
amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall
have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or
discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the
beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma
calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (and
may include cost savings and synergies). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given
pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into account

226


-----

any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be
deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For
purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit
facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate,
a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually
chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

Note at February 1, 2020 (such redemption price (expressed in percentage of principal amount) being
set forth in the table under “Optional Redemption—Optional Redemption of the Euro Fixed Rate
_Notes” (excluding accrued but unpaid interest)), plus (ii) all required interest payments due on such_
Euro Fixed Rate Note to and including such date set forth in clause (i) (excluding accrued but unpaid
interest), computed upon the redemption date using a discount rate equal to the applicable Bund Rate at
such redemption date plus 50 basis points; over

(b) the outstanding principal amount of such Euro Fixed Rate Note,

as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate. Calculation of
the Fixed Rate Applicable Premium shall not be an obligation or duty of the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Additional Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Additional Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes” and, together with the Regulation S Global Notes, the
“Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the
144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests
will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by
Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes representing the
Additional Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Additional Notes are in global form, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have
the Additional Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Additional Notes in
certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be considered the registered owners or “holder”
of the Additional Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Additional Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable (or its nominees) will be considered the holder of the Additional Notes for all
purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and
the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders of the
Additional Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry
Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Additional
Notes in registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and
a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear or
Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or cause to
be issued Additional Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable

250


-----

(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the
restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable
law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a
partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the
transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferor
or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed; provided that a
Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a
Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to
protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them
may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance
with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Additional Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any
of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner
thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will
be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is
a means of evidencing title to the Additional Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Additional Notes; however, owners of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in
Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the BookEntry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global
Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be
equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit
their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or
on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational procedures;
provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less €100,000 principal amount at maturity, or less, may be
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

251


-----

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global
Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to
or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

   - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

   - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

   - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of
the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Initial Purchasers, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from
any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to
foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of the Additional Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of
the Additional Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and
Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action
in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and
Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Additional Notes in
certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Additional Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes
in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of
the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Through the 40[th] day after the later of the commencement of the Offering and the closing of the Offering
(the “40 Day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant to

252


-----

Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified
institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or
otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance
with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40 Day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest
in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest
in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear and Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Additional Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on
the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating
procedures.

253


-----

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent,
the Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Additional Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same
day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading
of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Additional Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems
are open for business.

**CERTAIN TAXATION CONSIDERATIONS**

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice_
_currently applicable in the Netherlands, the United States and Switzerland and does not purport to address the_
_tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the_
_tax consequences of a purchase of the Additional Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt_
_of interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Additional Notes or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, the Netherlands, the United States or Swiss_
_law as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that may_
_take effect after such date. References in this section to holders of the Additional Notes include the beneficial_
_owners of the Additional Notes. Terms defined under each subsection related to the Netherlands, the_
_United States and Swiss tax law below only have such meanings as defined therein for such respective section._
_The statements regarding the Netherlands, the United States and Swiss laws and practices set forth below assume_
_that the Additional Notes will be issued, and the transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the Indenture._

**The Netherlands**

This summary solely addresses the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposal of Additional Notes and does not purport to describe every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a
particular holder. Tax matters are complex, and the tax consequences of the Offering to a particular holder of
Additional Notes will depend in part on such holder’s circumstances. Accordingly, a holder is urged to consult
his or her own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the Offering to him or her,
including the applicability and effect of Dutch tax laws.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to
be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts
under Dutch tax law. Where in this summary the terms “the Netherlands” and “Dutch” are used, these refer
solely to the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This summary assumes that the Issuer is
organized, and that its business will be conducted, in the manner outlined in this Offering Memorandum. A
change to such organizational structure or to the manner in which the Issuer conducts its business may invalidate
the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect any such change.

This summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at
the date of this Offering Memorandum. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is subject to changes,
possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be
updated to reflect such change.

The summary (with the exception of the Withholding Tax paragraph) in this “Certain Taxation
_Considerations—The Netherlands” section does not address the Dutch tax consequences for a holder of_
Additional Notes who:

(i) is a person who may be deemed an owner of Additional Notes for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to
specific statutory attribution rules in Dutch tax law;

(ii) is, although in principle subject to Dutch corporation tax, in whole or in part, specifically exempt from
that tax in connection with income from Additional Notes;

(iii) is an investment institution as defined in the Dutch Corporation Tax Act 1969;

(iv) owns Additional Notes in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory
board, an employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role;

(v) has a substantial interest in the Issuer or a deemed substantial interest in the Issuer for Dutch tax
purposes. Generally, a person holds a substantial interest in the Issuer if (a) such person—either alone
or, in the case of an individual, together with his or her partner or any of his or her relatives by blood or
by marriage in the direct line (including foster-children) or of those of his or her partner for Dutch tax
purposes—owns or is deemed to own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the shares or of any class of
shares of the Issuer, or rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such an interest in the shares of the
Issuer or profit participating certificates relating to 5% or more of the annual profits or to 5% or more

255


-----

of the liquidation proceeds of the Issuer, or (b) such person’s shares, rights to acquire shares or profit
participating certificates in the Issuer are held by him or her following the application of a
non-recognition provision; or

(vi) is for Dutch tax purposes taxable as a corporate entity and resident of Aruba, Curaçao or Sint Maarten.

**_Withholding Tax_**

All payments under the Additional Notes may be made free from withholding or deduction of or for any
taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision or
taxing authority of or in the Netherlands.

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

_Resident Holders of the Additional Notes_

A holder of Additional Notes who is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax
purposes is fully subject to Dutch income tax if he or she is an individual or fully subject to Dutch corporation
tax if it is a corporate entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund, taxable as a
corporate entity, as described in the summary below.

Individuals Deriving Profits or Deemed to be Deriving Profits from an Enterprise

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Additional Notes that are
attributable to an enterprise from which an individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a
co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise, other than as a shareholder, are generally subject to Dutch
income tax at progressive rates up to 51.75%.

Individuals Deriving Benefits from Miscellaneous Activities

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Additional Notes that constitute
benefits from miscellaneous activities by an individual are generally subject to Dutch income tax at progressive
rates up to 51.75%.

An individual may, inter alia, derive or be deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Additional
Notes that are taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities if his or her investment activities go beyond
regular active portfolio management.

Other Individuals

If a holder of Additional Notes is an individual whose situation has not been discussed before in this section
“Resident Holders of the Additional Notes,” the value of his or her Additional Notes forms part of the yield basis
for purposes of tax on benefits from savings and investments. A deemed benefit, which is determined on the
basis of progressive rates starting from 1.94% up to 5.6% per annum of this yield basis, is taxed at the rate of
30%. A tax free allowance may be available. Actual benefits derived from or in connection with his or her
Additional Notes are not subject to Dutch income tax.

Corporate Entities

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Additional Notes that are held by a
corporate entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund, taxable as a corporate
entity, are generally subject to Dutch corporation tax.

General

A holder of Additional Notes will not be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes by
reason only of the execution and/or enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of Additional Notes or the
performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Additional Notes.

256


-----

_Non-Resident Holders of the Additional Notes_

Individuals

If a holder of Additional Notes is an individual who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch income tax, he or she will not be subject to Dutch income tax in respect of any
benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Additional Notes, except if:

(i) he or she derives profits from an enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement
to the net value of such enterprise, other than as a shareholder, and such enterprise is carried on, in
whole or in part, through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands,
and his or her Additional Notes are attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent
representative; or

(ii) he or she derives benefits or is deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Additional Notes
that are taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities performed in the Netherlands.

Corporate Entities

If a holder of Additional Notes is a corporate entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and
a mutual fund, taxable as a corporate entity, which is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch corporation tax, it will not be subject to Dutch corporation tax in respect of
any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Additional Notes, except if:

(i) it derives profits from an enterprise directly which is carried on, in whole or in part, through a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands, and to which permanent
establishment or permanent representative its Additional Notes are attributable; or

(ii) it derives profits pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise which is managed in the
Netherlands, other than as a holder of securities, and to which enterprise its Additional Notes are
attributable.

General

If a holder of Additional Notes is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such holder
will for Dutch tax purposes not carry on or be deemed to carry on an enterprise, in whole or in part, through a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands by reason only of the execution and/or
enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of Additional Notes or the performance by the Issuer of its
obligations under such documents or under the Additional Notes.

**_Gift and Inheritance Taxes_**

No Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax will arise with respect to an acquisition or deemed acquisition of
Additional Notes by way of gift by, or upon the death of, a holder of Additional Notes who is neither resident nor
deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax except if, in the
event of a gift whilst not being a resident nor being a deemed resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch
gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax, the holder of Additional Notes becomes a resident or a deemed resident in the
Netherlands and dies within 180 days after the date of the gift.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax and Dutch inheritance tax, a gift of Additional Notes made under a condition
precedent is deemed to be made at the time the condition precedent is satisfied.

**_Registration Taxes and Duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, transfer tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty, other than
court fees, is payable in the Netherlands in respect of or in connection with the execution and/or enforcement
(including by legal proceedings and including the enforcement of any foreign judgment in the courts of the
Netherlands) of the documents relating to the issue of Additional Notes, the performance by the Issuer of its
obligations under such documents or under Additional Notes, or the transfer of Additional Notes, except that
Dutch real property transfer tax may be due upon an acquisition, in connection with Additional Notes, of real
property situated in the Netherlands, (an interest in) an asset that qualifies as real property situated in the
Netherlands, or (an interest in) a right over real property situated in the Netherlands, for the purposes of Dutch
real property transfer tax.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax effects. The summary is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except for the
discussions below under “—Additional Notes” and “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and does not address
the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws)
or any state, local or non U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any time,
possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences
described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be
sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not
take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
Additional Notes than those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of
litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character
of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Additional Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax, the alternative minimum tax, or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, or to holders
subject to special rules, such as banks, certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies,
individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities,
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass through entities and investors
in such entities, entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules, persons holding the Additional Notes as part of
a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, and persons subject to special tax
accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Additional Notes being taken into account in an
applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Additional
Notes for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the
Additional Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the
Additional Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of
the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation (or any
other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United
States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if it is subject to
the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury
regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the
Additional Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of
the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Additional Notes,
and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general information
purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the
tax consequences of holding Additional Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application
of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal, state,
local, foreign or other tax laws.

**_Characterization of the Additional Notes_**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld
or deducted from payments on the Additional Notes (as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding

258


-----

_Taxes”) or make payments in redemption of the Additional Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and_
accrued interest (as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption”). Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the_
possibility of paying such additional amounts or making additional payments in redemption of the Additional
Notes does not result in the Additional Notes being treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” under the
applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the
issuance of the Additional Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid, or additional
payments in redemption of the Additional Notes will have to be made, is a remote or incidental contingency
within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that the Additional Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a
U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which
such U.S. Holder acquires the Additional Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to
accrue interest income on its Additional Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of
accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no
contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Additional Notes. In
addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Additional Notes would
generally be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding
the tax consequences of the Additional Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Additional Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments.

**_Qualified Reopening and Fungibility with the Existing Notes_**

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the Additional Notes will be issued in a “qualified
reopening” of the Existing Notes and will be fungible with the Existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If the issuance of the Additional Notes is properly treated as a qualified reopening of the Existing
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Notes will be deemed to have the same issue date, the
same issue price and the same adjusted issue price as the Existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes
even though, considered separately, the Additional Notes might be considered to be issued at a premium or
discount.

**_Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest_**

A portion of the price paid for the Additional Notes will be allocable to unpaid interest that accrued prior to
the date the Additional Notes are purchased (the “pre-issuance accrued interest”). We intend to take the position
that, on the first payment date, a portion of the interest received in an amount equal to the pre-issuance accrued
interest is treated as a return of a portion of the purchase price paid for the Additional Notes that is allocable to
the pre-issuance accrued interest and not as a payment of interest on the Additional Notes. Amounts treated as a
return of pre-issuance accrued interest should not be taxable when received but should reduce a U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Notes by a corresponding amount (in the same manner as would a payment of principal),
except that a U.S. Holder generally should be required to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss, as
discussed below, in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the pre-issuance
accrued interest at the time of purchase and at the time the payment of such pre-issuance accrued interest is
received, as determined at the spot rate in effect on each such date.

**_Bond Premium_**

A U.S. Holder that purchases an Additional Note for an amount (excluding any amount attributable to
pre-issuance accrued interest) that exceeds the sum of all amounts payable on the Additional Notes, other than
payments of qualified stated interest, as defined below (any such excess being “amortizable bond premium”),
may elect to reduce the amount required to be included in the U.S. Holder’s income each year with respect to
qualified stated interest, as defined below, on the Additional Note by the amount of amortizable bond premium
allocable (based on the Additional Note’s yield to maturity) to that year. However, because the Additional Notes
are subject to optional redemption by us, special rules apply which could result in a deferral of the amortization
of some or all amortizable bond premium until later during the term of the Additional Notes. Any election to
amortize bond premium shall apply to all debt instruments (other than debt instruments the interest on which is
excludable from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes) held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of
the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and is irrevocable

259


-----

without the consent of the IRS. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer), or that is treated as
constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate. Stated interest payable on the Additional Notes
will be qualified stated interest. Amortizable bond premium will be computed in euros. A U.S. Holder may
recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of bond premium amortized
with respect to a period determined on the date the interest attributable to such period is received and the U.S.
dollar value of that portion of the bond premium determined on the date of the acquisition of the Additional
Notes.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of stated interest on an Additional
Note (other than any pre-issuance accrued interest, as discussed above under “—Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest”)
will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your
method of accounting for tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Additional Notes (which includes any
foreign tax withheld), you will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any
foreign tax withheld.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be
required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received, determined by translating the
foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of
such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign
currency so received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may
determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two
methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar
value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the
average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual
period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the
second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on: the last day of the accrual
period; the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period
straddles your taxable year; or the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business
days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the
advisability of making the above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on an Additional Note
(including, upon the sale of an Additional Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to
accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of
accounting for United States federal income tax purposes will recognize United States source ordinary income or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by
translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar
value of the stated interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment. This
exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.
source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (including any additional amounts) on an Additional Note generally will constitute
foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax
credit allowable to U.S. Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on
a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are
complex and depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Additional Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, an Additional U.S.
Holder generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount

260


-----

realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest not previously
included in income, which will be taxable as such) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional
Note. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of an Additional Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of
such foreign currency based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of an Additional Note that is
considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an
accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such
amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis
U.S. Holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Additional Notes traded on an established securities
market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed
without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will
recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and
the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss.
A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such
Additional Note by such U.S. Holder, reduced by any amortized bond premium. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign
currency to purchase an Additional Note, the amount paid for the Additional Note generally will be the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase. In the case
of an Additional Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder
and, if it makes the special election described in the preceding paragraph, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will
determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price at the spot rate on the settlement date of
the purchase.
Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
an Additional Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and, except as discussed below with respect
to foreign currency gain or loss, generally will be long term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder has
held the Additional Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains of
non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the
Additional Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Additional Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source
income, respectively, and will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest
income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of an Additional Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign
currency purchase price of the Additional Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates with respect to the principal amount of such Additional Note generally will equal the difference, if any,
between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Additional Note, determined at the spot rate on
the date the U.S. Holder disposes of the Additional Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of
the Additional Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Additional Note. In
addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a
U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and
unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” However,
upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a U.S. Holder
will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued
and unpaid stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such
disposition.

**_Additional Notes_**
The Issuer may issue additional Notes as described under “Description of the Notes.” These additional
Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes, in some cases
may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the additional Notes may
be considered to have a different amount of original issue discount than the original Notes or be subject to the
contingent payment debt instrument rules which may affect the market value of the original Notes if the
additional Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**
Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax shelter
transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an
individual or trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable

261


-----

disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to
an investment in the Additional Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction
Disclosure Statement).

Individuals (and, under proposed Treasury regulations, certain entities) that own “specified foreign financial
assets” with an aggregate value exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information
report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Additional Notes generally will constitute specified
foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Additional Notes are held in an
account at certain financial institutions.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Additional Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and stated interest on the
Additional Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a
Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient (such as a corporation), and, when
required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be
required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if (1) the U.S. Holder fails
to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number or to establish an exemption from backup withholding;
(2) the IRS notifies the payor that the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect;
(3) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (4) the U.S.
Holder has not certified under penalties of perjury that it has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number,
that it is a “United States person” (as defined in the Code), and that the IRS has not notified such U.S. Holder that
it is subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the backup withholding rules on their
particular circumstances.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax (currently at a rate of 30%) on certain
“foreign passthru payments” to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S.-source
payments. Under proposed Treasury regulations, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is two years after
the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are published
generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the
date of this Offering Memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been published.
Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the
Additional Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Additional Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. However, if additional Notes are issued after the
expiration of the grandfathering period, have the same CUSIP or ISIN as the relevant Additional Notes issued
hereby, and are subject to withholding under FATCA, then withholding agents may treat all notes in such series,
including the relevant Additional Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Non U.S.
governments have entered into intergovernmental agreements with the United States (and additional non U.S.
governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules
described herein. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Additional Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any
payments on the Additional Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the
withheld amount.

**_Switzerland_**

The following statements contain an overview of the Swiss tax implications resulting from the Additional
Notes. This summary is based on legislation, regulations and regulatory practices, in each case as of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, and a tax ruling with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, and does not aim to be a
comprehensive description of all the Swiss tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to invest in the
Additional Notes.

262


-----

Potential investors are advised not to rely upon the tax summary contained in this Offering Memorandum
but to ask for their own tax adviser’s advice on their individual taxation with respect to the acquisition,
ownership and sale of, and other events in relation to, the Additional Notes. Only these advisers are in a position
to duly consider the specific situation of the potential investor. The tax treatment of the Notes depends on the
individual tax situation of the relevant investor and may be subject to change.

**_Swiss Withholding Tax (Verrechnungssteuer)_**

Payments by the Issuer, of interest on, and repayment of principal of, the Additional Notes, will not be
subject to Swiss withholding tax, provided that the Issuer is at all times resident and managed outside
Switzerland for Swiss tax purposes and a tax ruling with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration confirms that the
planned use of proceeds in Switzerland is not considered as harmful use of proceeds in accordance with the
practice of the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.

On November 4, 2015 the Swiss Federal Council announced a mandate to the Swiss Federal Finance
Department to institute a group of experts tasked with the preparation of a new proposal for a reform of the Swiss
withholding tax system. The proposal is expected to include in respect of interest payments the replacement of
the existing debtor-based regime by a paying agent-based regime for Swiss withholding tax. This paying agentbased regime is expected to be similar to the one contained in the draft legislation published by the Swiss Federal
Council on December 17, 2014, which was subsequently withdrawn on June 24, 2015. However, on October 23,
2017, the Swiss Federal Economic Affairs and Taxation Committee of the Swiss National Council filed a
parliamentary initiative reintroducing the request to replace the current debtor-based regime applicable to interest
payments with a paying agent-based system for Swiss withholding tax. The initiative requests the
implementation of a paying agent-based system that (i) subjects all interest payments made to individuals
resident in Switzerland to Swiss withholding tax and (ii) provides an exemption from Swiss withholding tax for
interest payments to all other persons (including Swiss corporations). If any such a new paying agent-based
regime were to be enacted and were to result in the deduction or withholding of Swiss withholding tax on any
interest payments in respect of a Note by any person other than the Issuer, failing which the Guarantor, the
noteholder would not be entitled to receive any additional amounts as a result of such deduction or withholding
under the terms of the Notes. In the meantime, the Swiss Federal Council has adopted the key objectives of the
reform and commissioned the Federal Department of Finance (EFD) to prepare a consultation draft by end of
first quarter 2020.

**_Swiss Stamp Taxes_**

The issue and redemption of Additional Notes by the Issuer are not subject to Swiss stamp duty.

The issue, and the sale and delivery, of Notes on the Issue Date and the giving of the Guarantee will not be
subject to Swiss securities transfer tax (Umsatzabgabe) (primary market). Secondary market dealings in Notes
will be subject to Swiss securities transfer tax at a rate of up to 0.30% of such consideration paid for the Notes,
however, in each case only if a Swiss domestic bank or a Swiss domestic securities dealer (as defined in the
Swiss Federal Stamp Duty Act) is a party, or acts as an intermediary, to the transaction and no statutory
exemption applies in respect of the one or other party to the transaction. Subject to any such statutory exemption
for the one or other party, generally half of the tax is charged to the one and the other half to the other party to the
transaction. Where both the seller and the purchaser of the Notes are not residents of Switzerland or the
Principality of Liechtenstein, no Swiss securities transfer tax applies.

**_Swiss Income Taxation_**

_Notes Held by Non-Swiss Noteholders_

A noteholder who is not resident in Switzerland and who during the taxation year has not engaged in a trade
or business carried on through a permanent establishment in Switzerland to which the Note is attributable will in
respect of such Note not be subject to income tax in Switzerland.

For a discussion of the potential new Swiss withholding tax legislation replacing the current issuer-based
withholding tax system for a paying-agent based system, see above under “—Swiss Withholding Tax,” for a
discussion of the automatic exchange of information in tax matters, see below under “—Automatic Exchange of
_Information” and for a discussion of the Swiss facilitation of the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax_
Compliance Act, see below under “—Swiss Facilitation of the Implementation of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax
_Compliance Act.”_

_Notes Held by Swiss Resident Noteholders as Private Assets_

_Notes without a “predominant one-time interest payment”: If the yield-to-maturity of a Note predominantly_
derives from periodic interest payments and not from a one-time-interest-payment such as an original issue
discount or a repayment premium, then a noteholder who is an individual resident in Switzerland and who holds
the Note as a private asset is required to include in his or her personal income tax return for the relevant tax
period any periodic interest payments and any one-time interest payment received on the Note in such period,
converted into Swiss Francs at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment, as the case may be, and will
be taxable on any net taxable income (including such amounts) for the relevant tax period. A gain, which may
include interest accrued or gain relating to an exchange rate change or a market interest rate change, realized on
the sale of such a Note is a tax-free private capital gain, and a loss realized on the sale of such a Note a non-tax
deductible private capital loss.

_Notes with a “predominant one-time interest payment”: If the yield-to-maturity of a Note predominantly_
derives from a one-time-interest-payment such as an original issue discount or a repayment premium and not
from periodic interest payments, then a noteholder who is an individual resident in Switzerland and holds the
Note as a private asset, is required to include in his or her personal income tax return for the relevant tax period
any periodic interest payments and any one-time interest payment received on the Note in such period, converted
into Swiss Francs at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment, as the case may be, and, in addition, any
amount equal to the difference between the value of the Note at redemption or sale, as applicable, and its value at
issuance or secondary market purchase, as applicable, and converted into Swiss Francs at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time of sale or redemption, issuance or purchase, respectively, and will be taxable on any net
taxable income (including such amounts) for the relevant tax period. Any value decrease realized on such Note
on sale or redemption may be offset by such a noteholder against any gains (including periodic interest
payments) realized by him or her within the same taxation period from other securities with a predominant
onetime interest payment.

_Notes Held as Swiss Business Assets_

Individuals who hold Notes through a business in Switzerland, and Swiss-resident corporate taxpayers, and
corporate taxpayers resident abroad holding Notes through a permanent establishment situated in Switzerland,
are required to recognize payments in respect of the Notes and a gain or loss realized on the disposal or
redemption of Notes (including relating to a foreign currency exchange rate change or market interest rate
change) in their income for the relevant tax period, and will be taxable on any net taxable earnings for such tax
period at the then prevailing tax rates. The same taxation treatment also applies to Swiss-resident individuals
who, for Swiss income tax purposes, classify as “professional securities dealers” for reasons of, among other
things, frequent dealings, or leveraged transactions, in securities.

**_Automatic Exchange of Information_**

Switzerland has concluded a multilateral agreement with the EU on the international automatic exchange of
information (the “AEOI”) in tax matters (the “AEOI Agreement”). The AEOI Agreement became effective as
of January 1, 2017. On January 1, 2017, the multilateral competent authority agreement on the automatic
exchange of financial account information (the “MCAA”) became effective. Based on the MCAA, about 40
bilateral AEOI agreements with other countries have been concluded. Pursuant to the AEOI Agreement and the
bilateral AEOI agreements and the implementing laws of Switzerland, Switzerland collects and exchanges data
on financial assets (including income derived therefrom), which may include the Additional Notes, held in and
credited to accounts or deposits with a paying agent in Switzerland for the benefit of residents’ treaty states. A
list of the AEOI agreements of Switzerland in effect or signed and becoming effective can be found on the
website of the State Secretariat for International Finance (SIF).

**_Swiss Facilitation of the Implementation of the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Switzerland has concluded an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. to facilitate the implementation of
FATCA. The agreement ensures that the accounts held by U.S. persons with Swiss financial institutions are
disclosed to the U.S. tax authorities either with the consent of the account holder or by means of group requests
within the scope of administrative assistance. Information will not be transferred automatically in the absence of
consent, and instead will be exchanged only within the scope of administrative assistance on the basis of the
double taxation agreement between the U.S. and Switzerland. On October 8, 2014, the Swiss Federal Council
approved a mandate for negotiations with the U.S. on changing the current direct-notification-based regime to a

264


-----

regime where the relevant information is sent to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, which in turn provides
the information to the U.S. tax authorities.

**Certain General Tax Considerations**

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payment in respect of the Additional Notes, it is possible that such payments may
be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of
any applicable double taxation treaty, or to any other exemption that may apply. It is not certain that such
payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for such exemptions.

265

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

_The Issuer of the Additional Notes is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. The Guarantors for_
_the Additional Notes are incorporated under the laws of Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the_
_Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The documents relating to the Collateral for the Additional Notes will be_
_governed by the laws of the Netherlands, Belgium, England and Wales, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and_
_Switzerland. The Indenture (including the Guarantees) and the Additional Notes are governed by New York law._
_The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer_
_and each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all of the assets of the_
_Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers, are located outside the_
_United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other_
_non-U.S. resident person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and_
_interest on the Additional Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S._
_federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and_
_each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the_
_jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Additional Notes_
_and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process_
_on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions_
_predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. It may be possible for investors to_
_effect service of process within other jurisdictions upon those persons, the Issuer or the Guarantors provided_
_that, for example, The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil_
_or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with._

_If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce_
_such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S._
_court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which each of the Guarantors_
_or the Collateral is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to_
_enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States._

**The Netherlands**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain United States court judgments in the
Netherlands is based upon advice provided to us by our Dutch legal advisors.

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors (as defined below) are incorporated under Dutch law and have their
registered seat in the Netherlands. None of the directors of the Issuer reside in the United States and a substantial
amount of the Issuer’s assets, and a substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch Guarantors’ directors are
located outside of the United States.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a
final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable
in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under
current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results
from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene
public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an
internationally acceptable ground and (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered
between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a
non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the
earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from
U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In
addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original
action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Belgium**

In the absence of any bilateral or multilateral treaty, a final and enforceable judgment of the courts
exercising jurisdiction in the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Belgium without

266


-----

review on the merits subject to the conditions specified in Articles 22 to 25 of the Belgian Code of Private
International Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé).

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents must be
produced in court by the claimant:

   - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

   - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating
process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law; and

   - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and
has been notified to the defendant.

However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the
Belgian Code of Private International Law, and notably if:

   - the rights of defense have been violated;

   - such recognition or enforcement would be incompatible with Belgian public policy;

   - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets without
any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state;

   - the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement
could then be granted) or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable
laws;

   - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been
sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with
Belgian private international law;

   - the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending
between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter;

   - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in
another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium;

   - Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or

   - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in
relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). In
Belgium the procedural rules set out in, among others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of Private
International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by United States courts is
sought in Belgium.

In the case of an enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of foreign
court decisions in Belgium), a registration tax at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is payable by the
debtor, if the sum of money that the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court, or by a foreign court judgment
that is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian
court, exceeds €12,500. A nominal registration tax would be due on the registration of bailiff deeds.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in
England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England
and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter
decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary
judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by

267


-----

which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to trial. Recognition and
enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things)
the following:

   - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles and rules of English private international law;

   - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

   - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court that pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

   - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights
or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent
applicable);

   - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or
in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or
revenue law;

   - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

   - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural
justice;

   - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or other
non U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior inconsistent
judgment given in a Hague Convention Member State of the European Union or a member state of the
EEA which the English court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention Choice of Court
Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the Lugano
Conventions of 1988 and 2007;

   - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the United
States;

   - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and

   - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S.
judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you
that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In particular, a judgment given by
a U.S. federal or state court may not be enforced by the courts of England and Wales if such judgment:

   - is subject to a pending or proposal appeal;

   - cannot be enforced in the state in which the judgment was given; or

   - was made in proceedings, the bringing of which was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute
in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of that country, unless such
proceedings were brought by or with the agreement of the person against where the judgment was
given or that person submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts.

In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if
proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Furthermore, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in
England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar
proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note
that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been
brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim
was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

268


-----

**France**

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
claims connected with the Additional Notes against French entities and/or French individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a
judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely
upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, or enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in
France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the competent French civil court is
satisfied that the following cumulative conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case
law as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the
foreign judgment):

   - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such U.S. court (i.e., there was no international forum
shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive
jurisdiction over the matter;

   - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

   - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final, binding and enforceable foreign judicial
decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect such as autorité de la chose jugée and force exécutoire) can
benefit from an exequatur under French law, and that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French
judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before
French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject
matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res
judicata effect (autorité de la chose jugée) as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be
declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under
certain circumstances by French Law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French Law No. 80 538 of
July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of
documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign
authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in
connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations mentioned above, the U.S.
authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence
Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (Law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and
individual liberties, as most recently modified by French Ordinance No. 2011-2012 of August 24, 2011 and
French law No. 2014-344 of March 17, 2014) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining
information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a
discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their
contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public
policy (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on
the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the
remedies sought.

269


-----

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an
individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French
individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant
before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a
foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning
that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a
jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to recent case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over
French nationals is not mandatory to the extent that an action has been initiated before a foreign court in a
jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In
addition, a French national may waive his or her rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the
French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of December 12, 2012, with respect to legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges
granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code do not prevail European
provisions in disputes opposing French nationals to a person domiciled in a Member State. Conversely, pursuant
to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code
may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French
courts a defendant domiciled outside the European Union. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has
recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving
another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any
provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Italy**

We have been advised by our Italian counsel, that final, enforceable and conclusive judgments rendered by
U.S. courts, even if rendered by default, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that
pursuant to Article 64 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto
_internazionale privato) the following conditions are met:_

   - the relevant U.S. court that rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law
principles of jurisdiction;

   - the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance with
U.S. law and during the proceedings the fundamental rights of the defendant have not been violated;

   - the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the event of
default by the defendant, the relevant U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S. law;

   - the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law (‘passato in
_giudicato’);_

   - there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

   - there is no action pending in Italy among the same parties for decision on the same subject-matter,
which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

   - the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of May 31, 1995, if the judgment rendered by
the U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or it is necessary to enforce such judgment, a
proceeding must be instituted in the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of Italy to this end. The
competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but reviews exclusively the existence of all
the requirements set out above (including that requiring that the judgment rendered by the U.S. federal or New
York state court is not contrary to public policy (ordine pubblico) in Italy).

In original actions brought before Italian courts, there is doubt as to the enforceability of liabilities or
remedies based solely on the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian
courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive provisions of
Italian law that are regarded as mandatory and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions if the relevant application
violates Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

Please note that Italian courts do not accept an uncertified copy of the foreign decision and require the
original copy of the decision or a certified copy. The decision must be translated into Italian and the translation
must be sworn.

Finally, any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country subject to the
provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council would be recognized and
enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

**Spain**

Certain of Selecta’s subsidiaries in Spain guarantee both the Additional Notes and the Revolving Credit
Facility, with certain limitations due to Spanish mandatory rules and practice (each, a “Spanish Guarantor”).
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, any proceeds from the Spanish guarantees received by the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be shared with the lenders in respect of certain hedging obligations
and holders of the Additional Notes on a pari passu basis.

A final judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors outside of Spain (and, in particular, in
the United States), other than in a country bound by the provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European
Parliament and of the Council, would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Spain (unless such judgment
contravenes principles of Spanish public policy) pursuant to the following regimes:

   - according to the provisions of any applicable treaty (there being none currently in existence between
Spain and the United States for these purposes);

   - in the absence of any such treaty, if it could be proven that the jurisdiction in which the foreign
judgment was rendered recognizes Spanish judgments on a reciprocal basis (positive reciprocity) and
provided that certain minimum conditions are met (among others, that the matter is not exclusively
subject to Spanish jurisdiction, does not infringe public policy and does not contradict a previous
Spanish judgment). If it could be proven (usually by the defendant) that the U.S. jurisdiction in which
the judgment was obtained does not recognize judgments issued by Spanish courts, then the Spanish
courts would not recognize the U.S. judgment in Spain (negative reciprocity); and

   - in the absence of any such treaty and where reciprocity has not been evidenced (and, according to
certain court precedents, even if positive reciprocity has been evidenced), the judgment would be
enforced in Spain if it satisfies all of the following requirements in compliance with and subject to
Article 523 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Act (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero de Enjuiciamiento Civil) and
subject to Law 29/2015, of July 30, on International Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters (Ley 29/2015,
_de 30 de julio, de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional en materia civil) (the “Law on International_
**Legal Cooperation in Civil Matters”) which repeals Articles 951 to 958 of the former Spanish Civil**
Procedure Act of 1881 (Real Decreto de Promulgación de 3 de febrero de 1881 de Enjuiciamiento
_Civil):_

(i) such U.S. judgment is final and conclusive (firme);

(ii) the judgment is rendered as a result of an action in personam as opposed to an action in rem;

(iii) the judgment is not contrary to Spanish public policy and the obligation to be fulfilled is legal in
Spain;

(iv) the documentation prepared for the purposes of requesting the enforcement meets all the legal
requirements under the law of the jurisdiction in which the judgment was rendered in order to be
considered an authentic judgment and it also meets all requirements under the laws of Spain to be
admitted (the judgment is final, and a literal, authentic, sworn Spanish translation and apostilled
copy is provided);

(v) there is not a pending proceeding between the same parties and in relation to the same issues in
Spain;

(vi) there is not a judgment rendered between the same parties and for the same cause of action in
Spain or in another country; provided that, the judgment has been recognized in Spain;

(vii) where rendering the judgment, the courts rendering it did not infringe an exclusive ground of
jurisdiction provided for under Spanish law or based their jurisdiction on exorbitant grounds and
the choice of court is not fraudulent; and

271


-----

(viii) the rights of defense of the defendant were protected where rendering the judgment, including,
but not limited to, a proper service of process carried out with sufficient time for the defendant to
prepare its defense.

Any party wishing to have a U.S. ruling recognized or enforced in Spain must file an application seeking
declaration of enforceability of the U.S. resolution (exequatur) with the relevant Spanish Judge of First Instance
(Juzgado de Primera Instancia) or Commercial Court (Juzgado de lo Mercantil).

The Spanish courts may express any such order in a currency other than euro in respect of the amount due
and payable by the Issuer or Guarantor, but in case of enforcement in Spain, the court costs and interest will be
paid in euros. Any judgment obtained against the Issuer or any of the Guarantors in any country bound by the
provisions of EU Regulation 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council would be recognized and
enforced in accordance with the terms set forth thereby.

The enforcement of any judgment in Spain entails, among others, the following actions and costs:
(a) translation fees for documents in a language other than Spanish, which must be accompanied by a sworn
translation into Spanish; (b) certain professional fees for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating
in Spain, if needed; (c) judicial tax and fees; and (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain must be
directed by an attorney at law and the party must be represented by a court agent (procurador). In addition, please
note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore
prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Additional Notes.

**Sweden**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of December 12, 2012 on the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
commercial matters (recast) (the “Brussels Regulation”), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of
a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all Member States of the European Union) and which is enforceable in
such a Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden without any declaration of enforceability being
required. The applicant will need to provide the competent enforcement authority, in accordance with the
Swedish Enforcement Act (Sw. Utsökningsbalk 1981:774), with a copy of the judgment and a certificate
certifying that the judgment is enforceable, as further described in the Brussels Regulation. However, upon an
application against the enforcement pursuant to the Brussels Regulation the court with which the application is
lodged may refuse enforcement.

With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and
Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a company in the courts of a
Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a state, will be directly
enforceable in Sweden provided that the concerned party has submitted an application for declaration of
enforceability to the appropriate Swedish district court (Sw. tingsrätt) and comply with the proceedings of that
court and, if the judgment is declared enforceable, apply to the Swedish Enforcement Agency for enforcement in
accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (Sw. Utsökningsbalk 1981:774) and comply with the relevant
proceedings.

Judgments entered against any Swedish party in the courts of a state that is not a Member State under the
terms of the Brussels Regulation or a Contracting State under the terms of the Lugano Convention (e.g., the
United States), would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without retrial on its
merits. If the party in whose favor the final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in
Sweden, the party may however submit to the Swedish court the final judgment that has been rendered in the
United States. A judgment by a court in the United States may be regarded by a court, administrative tribunal or
executive or other public authority of Sweden as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which the judgment
relates, and a Swedish court may in its discretion choose to rehear the dispute ab initio.

**Switzerland**

We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in
Switzerland, or the applicability of U.S. federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court.
The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or
state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal
or state court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in

272


-----

accordance with the proceeding set forth by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz
_über das internationale Privatrecht) and the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische_
_Zivilprozessordnung) and, in certain circumstances, the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Bankruptcy_
(Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S.
judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in articles
25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale
_Privatrecht), which include, among others:_

   - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective;

   - the judgment of such U.S. court is final and non-appealable under U.S. federal or state law;

   - service of process to the defendant was completed in accordance with the relevant legal requirements at
the defendant’s domicile or permanent residence (including requirements resulting from applicable
international treaties), or the defendant unconditionally participated in the foreign proceedings:

   - the original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss
civil proceedings law, in particular the right to be heard;

   - the matter (Verfahren) between the same parties and on the same subject resulting in the judgment of
the U.S. court has either been (i) commenced or decided by a Swiss court, provided that such Swiss
matter was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings or decided by a
Swiss court before the decision of the U.S. court, or (ii) decided by a court in a third country, provided
such third country matter was decided prior to the decision of the U.S. court and such third country
matter is recognizable in Switzerland; and

   - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss public
policy (schweizerischer Ordre public).

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Additional Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however, assure you
that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a
Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court
during the substantive proceedings in the sense of art. 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law
(Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht).

Generally, if substantive proceedings relating to the Notes were commenced in Switzerland, it is likely that
a Swiss court would apply New York state law (as the Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York).
However, the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht)
allows for the application of Swiss law instead of the apparent applicable foreign law in the event that the
application of such foreign law would lead to a result which is incompatible with Swiss public policy
(schweizerischer Ordre public). Furthermore, irrespective of the law chosen by the parties and irrespective of any
other law deemed applicable based on the rules of the aforementioned act, a different law, i.e., Swiss law or, to a
lesser extent, a different foreign law, may be applicable due to its purpose in special cases. Thus, it cannot be
excluded that a Swiss court would, either in part or in full, apply a different law, other than the governing law of
the Notes, if substantive proceedings were commenced in Switzerland.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts
as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may
reduce the amount of damages ordered by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to
the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions
based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to
trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the depositions of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial
discovery process exists. Rather, Swiss civil procedure provides for the possibility for judicial pre-trial
proceedings concerning the precautionary production of evidence (vorsorgliche Beweisführung) only in certain
circumstances and under certain conditions. In addition, during the main proceedings, a Swiss court would decide
upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and the related burden of proof.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer,_
_the Guarantors and certain subsidiaries are incorporated or organized, and a summary of certain limitations on_
_the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests for the Additional Notes. The_
_description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to discuss all of the limitations or_
_considerations that may affect the validity and enforceability of the Additional Notes and the Guarantees and the_
_security interests. Prospective investors in the Additional Notes should consult their own legal advisors with_
_respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Member States of the European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the
European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main
interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to
commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its
“centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have
differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a debtor
has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to
the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State
within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1),
second sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests “shall be the place
where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third
parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the centre of main interests
of a debtor, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the
majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are
established. Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption should be rebutted where the
company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a
comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties,
that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located
in that other Member State. A debtor’s centre of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time
to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence
insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If the centre of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be
commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the
types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency
proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the
other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.

If the centre of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of
the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
commence territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an
“establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the
territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a
debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of
territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State will also be possible if the debtor had
an establishment in such EU Member State in the three month period prior to the request for commencement of
main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of
such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of

274


-----

main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in
another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be
commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under of the conditions
laid down by that Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by
(a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within
the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public
authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated,
has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions,
be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction
over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a
Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s centre of main
interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member
State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long
as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures
have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member
State where the debtor has assets. The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies
experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an
insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our
group’s members.

The “Restructuring and Insolvency Directive” (Directive (EU) 2019/1023) dated June, 20th 2019 was
adopted. It will have an impact on the insolvency law of Member States. The provisions of the Directive must be
transposed by Member States into internal law before July, 17th 2021 (Article 34).

The main objectives provided by the Directive are the following:

(i) reinforcement of pre-insolvency proceeding;

(ii) facilitate the adoption of restructuring plan (by introducing new classes of creditors and cross class
cram down as instance); and

(iii) faster proceedings.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantors”).
Accordingly, where debtors have their centre of main interests or an “establishment” in the Netherlands they may
be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain exceptions
provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation. See “—European Union.”

The Dutch insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of
other jurisdictions. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws.

Any insolvency proceedings applicable to the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors may be governed by Dutch
insolvency laws. There are two insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, a suspension of payments
(surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to
continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets
of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results
in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet).

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be
unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately
(dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders).
A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition
(ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order

275


-----

that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is
accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The
definitive moratorium will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one quarter of the
amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of
creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it
or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if
there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be
able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied
to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition).
Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months
(extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a of the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such
stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the
security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or
(ii) seek recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the
creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the
application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar
_Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar_
_belang). The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal_
treatment). Therefore, in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the
proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to
the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain
parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and
mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation
costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (i) a statutory stay of
execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order
pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of
execution in suspensions of payment; (ii) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security
interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the
proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (iii) excess proceeds of enforcement must
be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset (verrekend) against an unsecured claim of the
company’s secured creditor. Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy laws could reduce your potential recovery in Dutch
bankruptcy proceedings.

Both a suspension of payments and bankruptcy have retroactive effect from 00.00 hours of the day on which
the suspension of payments or the bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch company is declared.

Unlike chapter 11 proceedings under United States bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, a suspension of payment and bankruptcy
proceedings against Dutch debtors would allow secured creditors and preferential creditors (including tax and
social security authorities) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if
there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution as described above
may be ordered by the competent court both in a suspension of payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain
preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not
entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the
bankrupt’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking
rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory
stay of execution of security rights and other rights, as described above, may be imposed. Furthermore, a receiver
in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of time, failing
which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred
claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs,
which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may
not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set off may be allowed prior to the
bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith
in obtaining the claim used for the set off.

276


-----

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by the operation of law when a
suspension of payments is granted and terminate by the operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In
addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having
become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case
may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the
date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to
creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a
simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting,
representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted; and
(ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or
inhibit the ability of the holders of the Additional Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of
a holder of Additional Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest payments that
fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be
limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall
due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the
bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be
considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be
entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law means,
in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined
and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for
verification, and the receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and
whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of
bankruptcy, creditors who wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim
validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while
in a suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These
procedures could cause holders of Additional Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Additional
Notes or less than they could recover in a United States liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could
also cause payments to the holders of Additional Notes to be delayed. Interest on claims accruing after the
bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be
admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the Additional Notes. To the extent that interest is not covered by the
proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in
respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

The Dutch legislator has prepared a bill for the implementation of a composition outside bankruptcy or
moratorium of payments proceedings and is referred to as the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial
Restructuring Plans (WHOA). On July 8, 2019, the bill was submitted to the parliament and will now go through
the legislative process (which requires debate and adoption in the Second Chamber of Dutch Parliament and then
the First Chamber). It is still uncertain what the final legislation will be (due to possible amendments) and what
the timeline is for implementation. It is expected that this legislation will come into effect in the foreseeable
future. Under the WHOA as currently drafted, a proceeding somewhat similar to the chapter 11 proceedings
under United States bankruptcy law and the scheme of arrangement under English bankruptcy laws, will become
available for companies in financial distress, where the debtor stays in possession and can offer a composition
plan to its creditors (including secured creditors and shareholders). The new legislation also allows that group
companies providing guarantees for the debtors obligations are included in the plan. If and once this legislation
comes into force, a debtor may offer its creditors a composition plan which may also entail a revision or release
of the guarantees in place granted by group companies. As a result hereof, it may well be that claims against the
Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors can be compromised as a result of a composition if the relevant majority of
creditors within a class vote in favour of such a composition.

**_Enforceability of Guarantees and Security General Defenses and Corporate Benefit_**

In general, receipt of any payment under a Dutch law governed guarantee or security interest may be
affected by (i) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid), (ii) force
majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), and

277


-----

(iii) the other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of such guarantee or security interest. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or
security interest should be voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van
_omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include rights_
of suspension (opschorting), dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set off (verrekening). The enforceability
of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or
otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law
security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs.

Furthermore, if a Dutch Guarantor enters into a transaction (such as the granting of a guarantee or security
interest), the validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be contested by the Dutch company or its
administrator (bewindvoerder) in a suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy, if (i) that
transaction is not in the company’s corporate interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and (ii) the other party to the
transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation. In determining whether the
granting of a guarantee or the giving of security is in the interest of the relevant Dutch company, a Dutch court
would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but also all
relevant circumstances, including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction
in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and any indirect benefit derived by the relevant
Dutch company as a consequence of the interdependence of it with the group of companies to which it belongs
and whether or not the subsistence of the relevant Dutch company is jeopardized by conducting such transaction.
The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles
of association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in the corporate
interests.

As of October 1, 2012, the prohibition on financial assistance for a Dutch private limited liability company
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) was removed from Dutch law. In connection with such
removal the legislator noted that the granting of security with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing
thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent
company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra vires act. At present, there is no
Dutch case law on this subject.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside bankruptcy:
the actio pauliana provisions. Under Dutch law, any creditor of a Dutch Guarantor or its receiver (curator) may
nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Additional Notes,
under certain circumstances, if (i) the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection
with the Additional Notes was conducted without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the
creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its or their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of
such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions)
and (iii) at the time of the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the
Additional Notes was conducted (including the granting of the Guarantees or any security), the relevant Dutch
Guarantor and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or
should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio
_pauliana)._

A receiver (curator) may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s
creditors, and the burden of proof of the above mentioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on
the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is, however, presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a
“suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions
only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those
of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between
the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the
bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking
fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer
provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the
basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted
at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was
conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty in order to give preference to the

278


-----

counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a
Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful.

The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral will not prevent
effect being given to the overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the situation has a close
connection (and for this purpose “overriding provisions” are provisions the respect for which are regarded as
crucial by a jurisdiction for safeguarding its public interests to such an extent that they are applicable to any
situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to an agreement and include any
rules (whether mandatory or not) that must be applied pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation) and will not
prevent regard having to be had to the law of the jurisdiction in which performance takes place in relation to the
manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance. In addition, enforcement
of each Dutch law security interest in the Collateral (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch
law. Among other things, under Dutch law shares may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with
Dutch law and the articles of association of the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement.
Rights of third parties acquiring a share or a limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder trouw)
may also affect the binding effect and enforceability of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral.

In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public auction of
the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law. The Security Agent or the relevant security interest provider
may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the secured assets, except when otherwise agreed. In
the case of secured assets, the Security Agent and the security interest provider may agree to an alternative
foreclosure procedure once the security right has become enforceable. The security interest providers have
agreed to waive the right to request such alternative foreclosure procedure. The Security Agent may also request
the competent court to determine that the secured assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. In
the case of a pledge, the right of the relevant security interest provider to request approval of a private sale may
be excluded.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can
be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor.

**_Parallel Debt_**

It is generally assumed that under Dutch law security interests such as rights of pledge cannot be validly
created in favor of a person who is not the creditor of the claim that the security interest intends to secure. The
beneficial holders of the Additional Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order
to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the documentation
relating to the Additional Notes will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the
Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Additional
Notes. The pledges governed by Dutch law will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt concept has
not been tested under Dutch law, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability posed by Dutch law.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

To the extent any Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of Belgium (a “Belgian Guarantor”), and
provided Belgium is the territory in which the center of such Belgian Guarantor’s main interests is situated, main
insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. This also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is the
territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed
by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in
Belgium over the assets of companies whose centre of main interests is not situated in Belgium. The following is
a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present
transaction.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial
reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings
(faillissement/faillite).

Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX “Insolvency of enterprises” of the Belgian
Code of Economic Law (the “Belgian Insolvency Act”).

279


-----

Note that in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation
_déficitaire). The latter proceedings will not be further discussed._

**_Judicial Reorganization_**

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may
file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in
the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital
(maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A state
of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued
a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a
declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of
the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any
of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to
such assets.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the
court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction
of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary
moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial trustee in case of
a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the
moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelve months as from the start of the moratorium period. In
exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the
procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the
moratorium period for six months.

The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing
claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets
from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the
moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims. During the moratorium, the debtor
can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity,
judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their
conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material
adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable
property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial
reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are
pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged
receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor
(such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of
the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the
Belgian Guarantors, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium
(unless considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition
applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted
by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the
moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of
guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of
claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise.

During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor
continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However,
upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur
_d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of_
any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one
of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities
and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator

280


-----

(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice). Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the debtors or one
of its corporate bodies, the court may replace them with a temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/
_administrateur provisoire) for the duration of the moratorium._

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern.
Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which
provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization
procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure.
Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the
judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in
the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the creditor is
not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on
the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such
default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract
during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary
for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company
or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own
obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has
suspended the performance of its own obligations.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between
the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the
activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of
the court and/or third parties.

In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the
terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor
may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest
payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. The
court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content
of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan
during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of
liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization plan must be filed with the
electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the
date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it
taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in
value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote
and whether secured or not, although only limited measures can be imposed by such reorganization plan on
secured creditors without their individual consent. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities were not
complied with, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy.

To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the
ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors
individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of
details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other
interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims
declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a
preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in
case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the
amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and
the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval
of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the
purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the
assistance of the court-appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as the
reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based
on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities.

281


-----

The court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its
petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any
party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such
transfer in specific circumstances.

The court-ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de
_justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be limited to the transfer_
price, subject to some limited exceptions.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public
prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets
or by the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU Member State (other than Denmark)
in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation (Recast). Once the court ascertains that the requirements for
bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court
for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a
situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de
_paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement_
_de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they_
fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all
authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver
(curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements
the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor.
The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings
on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court,
or may request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one or
several ongoing contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will not impair
any rights in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an ongoing contract
may demand the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed
upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the
expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance of an ongoing contract or if an
ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may
be entitled to claim damages, in which case its claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured
creditors.

The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization
of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

   - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an
early termination or acceleration event; and

   - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the
court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may
proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on
financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act.
Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the
period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period
may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of
the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest

282


-----

of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been
given the opportunity to be heard by the court.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is
necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its
request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the
enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such
enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow
for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the
opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be
enforced during the suspension period.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an
insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security
shall, in accordance with the Insolvency Regulation (Recast), not be affected by the opening of such insolvency
proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its
unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of
the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a
general overview of only the main principles:

   - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the
so-called “estate debts,” have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the
realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of
the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

   - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset
(whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

   - Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims
for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of
the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests.

   - Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security
interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by
the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be
subordinated).

   - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Subsidiary Guarantee/Collateral_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group company
must fall within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the Belgian
Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate benefit is not a well-defined
concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules
and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not
clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing
factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would
actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and
collateral. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk
for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial
support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear
guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when
aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of
directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors will
be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be
expected to take a more critical view.

283


-----

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under civil
law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law
in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods”
(misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could
be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or
security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit requirement is not met and the creditor knew or
should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding
to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case
law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard
market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation
language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, section 11.03
(Limitation of Liability of Belgian Guarantors) of the Indenture contains such limitation language and the
Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor(s) will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is,
however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit.

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate
purpose and statutory purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association, and the
guarantee or collateral may not include any liability that would result in unlawful financial assistance in
accordance with article 329 and 629 of the Belgian Companies Code dated 7 May 1999, as amended or replaced
from time to time, or Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations dated 23 March
2019, as amended from time to time, whichever is applicable.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under the present Belgian legal system, the
nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as agent or trustee for holders
of the Additional Notes in respect of security interests such as pledges are debated and may not be effective or
enforceable under Belgian law. Pursuant to Belgian law, security is an “accessory” which must be granted to the
same person to whom the secured debt is owed, except in the case of financial collateral within the meaning of
the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or collateral subject to the Belgian Act of July 11, 2013 on in rem security
interests over movable assets.

In order to enable the Security Agent to hold security created under certain applicable law (including
Belgian law), the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of the parallel debt mirroring the obligations
of the Issuer and the Guarantors to the holders of the Additional Notes under or in connection with the Indenture.
The parallel debt structure is commonly used for the purposes of taking Belgian law security in the context of
transactions of this nature.

In the event of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the parallel debt structure means that the secured parties
may be exposed to credit risk on the Security Agent, if payments in respect of the parallel debt and any proceeds
received by the Security Agent cannot be separated from its other assets.

A parallel debt structure is not an uncommon market practice in Belgium and the validity thereof under
Belgian law is supported by legal authors. Although various valid arguments exist under Belgian law to the effect
that the security created in favor of the Security Agent, in its capacity as creditor of the parallel debt, would be
valid, the possibility of a Belgian court finding otherwise cannot be excluded, given that there is no case law on
this subject.

Lastly, Belgian pledges over financial collateral (such as the shares of the Belgian Guarantor) have been or
will be granted to the Security Agent acting for itself and for the account of the secured parties pursuant to
Article 5 of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. This provision allows for the creation of security over financial
collateral held by an agent acting as representative for secured parties, provided that the secured parties can be
determined on the basis of the security agreement.

**_Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
certain transactions that have been concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called “hardening
period.”

284


-----

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to
have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine,
based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such
earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where
the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the
bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of
cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period
from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening
period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective
against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an
undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and
(iv) security interests provided for pre-existing debts (save for any security granted during the suspension period
of judicial reorganization proceedings).

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective
against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or at an
undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian Guarantor’s
cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure pre-existing debts.

If the Guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on
the above), holders of the Additional Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under
an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the
security interests.

Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court ruling
that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged
act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor
(actio pauliana).

Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be
declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed
and the date of registration.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the
creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee.
Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of
jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Courts
may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which they may review.

**England and Wales**

Some of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and are subject to an English
law debenture and supplemental debenture. Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Guarantors
would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a
company incorporated under English law has its “centre of main interests” in a Member State other than England
and Wales, then the main insolvency proceedings for that company may be opened in the Member State in which
its centre of main interests is located and be subject to the laws of that Member State. The point at which this
issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The European
Commission has published amendments to the EU Insolvency Regulation which may alter the manner in which
the test for determining where a company has its centre of main interests might be applied during the term of the
Additional Notes. At this stage it is not possible to conclusively determine what (if any) impact there might be in
relation to the Additional Notes.

Similarly, the United Kingdom Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the
UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e.,

285


-----

non-English) court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its centre of main interests in such
foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction,
where it carries out non transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). To the extent
that the United Kingdom Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 conflict with an obligation of the United
Kingdom under the EU Insolvency Regulation, the requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail.

English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar and it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar
proceedings.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or the
holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court,
or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a
liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration
if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one
of three statutory purposes.

Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is unable
to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to
pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is
less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or, among
other matters, if it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to satisfy in
full a judgment debt (or similar court order).

The obligations under the Additional Notes are secured by English law governed security interests over the
Collateral and therefore English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of security
interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain
limitations on the security interests over the Collateral that are governed by English law. The application of these
laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the Collateral securing the
Additional Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English
company.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Fixed charge security has a number of advantages over floating charge security: (i) an administrator
appointed to the company which granted the floating charge can dispose of floating charge assets for cash or
collect receivables charged by way of floating charge and use the proceeds and/or cash subject to a floating
charge to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the charging
company’s business while in administration) in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (ii) a fixed
charge over assets, even if created after the date of a floating charge over the assets, may rank prior to the
floating charge over the relevant assets providing that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed
charge is granted and the fixed charge holder had no notice of any restrictions applicable to the creation of fixed
charge security; (iii) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a
winding up are payable out of floating charge assets to the extent the assets of the company available for
creditors generally are otherwise insufficient to meet them (subject to certain restrictions for the costs of
litigation) in priority to floating charge claims; (iv) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is
entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of its business,
meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good
title to the assets free of the floating charge; (v) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under
English insolvency law (see “—Grant of Floating Charge”) and (vi) floating charge security is subject to the
claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to
employees (subject to a cap per employee) and holiday pay owed to employees) and, where the floating charge is
not a security financial collateral arrangement, to the claims of unsecured creditors in respect of a ring fenced
amount of the proceeds (see “—Administration and Floating Charges” below).

Under English law there is the possibility that a court could recharacterize as floating charges any security
interests expressed to be created by a security document as fixed charges where the chargee does not have the
requisite degree of control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds

286


-----

thereof or does not exercise such control in practice because the description given to the charges in the relevant
security document as fixed charges is not determinative. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets
without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a
floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

Under English insolvency law, English courts are empowered to order the appointment of an administrator
in respect of an English company in certain circumstances. An administrator can also be appointed out of court
by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply
according to the identity of the appointer. During the administration of a company, a statutory moratorium is
imposed and a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral
arrangements) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator or the court. The moratorium
does not, however, apply to a “financial collateral agreement” (such as a charge over cash or financial
instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. In addition, in limited circumstances (as set forth in more detail below)
a secured creditor can appoint an administrative receiver, at which time no automatic statutory moratorium is
created and creditors may begin or continue any legal action against the company, including petitioning for
liquidation.

A chargee can appoint its choice of administrator by the out of court route or an administrative receiver if it
holds a qualifying floating charge and such floating charge security, together with fixed charge security charges
the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English chargor’s property. In order to constitute a qualifying
floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (i) states that the relevant statutory
provision applies to it, (ii) purports to empower the chargeholder to appoint an administrator of the company or
(iii) purports to empower the chargeholder to appoint an administrative receiver. Even if the chargee holds a
qualifying floating charge it can only appoint an administrative receiver if one of the exceptions to the general
prohibition of appointing an administrative receiver applies. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on
the appointment is that the chargee can appoint an administrative receiver under security forming part of a
“capital markets arrangement” (as defined in the Insolvency Act, as amended), which is the case if the issuer of
the notes incurs (or expected to incur) a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of
the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in
the Insolvency Act, as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). Once an administrative
receiver is appointed by the chargee the company or its directors will not be permitted to appoint an administrator
by the out of court route and a court will only appoint an administrator if the charge under which the
administrative receiver is appointed is successfully challenged or the chargee agrees. If an administrator is
appointed to a company, any administrative receiver then in office must vacate such office and any receiver of
part of the company’s property must resign if requested to do so by the administrator.

**_Liquidation or Winding Up_**

Liquidation is an asset realization and distribution procedure under which the assets of the company are
realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the
Insolvency Act, as amended. At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved. In the
case of a liquidation commenced by way of a court order, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or
continued against the company except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose
(although security enforcement is not affected).

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving the
prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any
other property of the company which is unsalable or not readily salable or is such that it may give rise to a
liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to
prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as
detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or
because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power does not apply to a contract
all the obligations under which have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the
business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and
to execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent transactions.

287


-----

**_Priority of Claims_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the
Insolvency Rules 1986, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the
insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the
“prescribed part” (see “—Prescribed Part”), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims
of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise,
distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to
each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

   - first ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets
of the debtor;

   - second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting forth the
order of priority in which expenses are paid);

   - third ranking claims: preferential creditors. Preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts
owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension
schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract
has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. As
between one another, preferential debts rank pari passu;

   - fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security.
However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the prescribed part
must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”);

   - fifth ranking claims: unsecured creditors. However, any secured creditor not repaid in full from the
realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a shortfall) from
the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim. To pay a shortfall, the officeholder can only use realization
from unsecured assets, because secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the prescribed
part in respect of a shortfall unless the prescribed part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

   - sixth ranking claims: subordinated creditors. Creditors whose claims are subordinated to the payment
of all of the insolvent company’s other creditors; and

   - seventh ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required
to ring fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of
unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the relevant company’s net
property and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the
assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the
relevant English chargor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at
that time.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law any debt of a company payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such
as euro or U.S. dollars) must be converted into pounds sterling at the official exchange rate prevailing at the date
when the company went into liquidation or, if the liquidation was immediately preceded by an administration, on
the date that the company entered administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties.
The “official exchange rate” for these purposes is the middle exchange rate in the London Foreign Exchange
Market at the close of business as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as
the court determines. Accordingly, in the event that an English company which has granted a guarantee or
security or the Issuer goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Additional Notes may be subject to
exchange rate risk between the date that such English company went into liquidation or administration and the
receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Additional Notes may become entitled.

288


-----

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or liquidator is
appointed to the company within a specified period (as set forth in more detail below) of the granting of the
guarantee or security and, in addition, the company was “unable to pay its debts” when the security interest or
guarantee was granted or “unable to pay its debts” as a result.

If security or a guarantee granted by an English company is challenged under the laws of England and
Wales, and the court makes certain findings (as described further below), it may be permitted to:

   - void or invalidate all or a portion of an English company’s obligations under the security and/or
guarantee provided by such English company;

   - direct that the holders of the Additional Notes return any amounts paid by or realized from an English
company under a guarantee or security to the relevant English company or to a fund for the benefit of
the English company’s creditors; and/or

   - take other action that is detrimental to the holders of the Additional Notes.

The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as
described further below) is within any of the requisite time periods set forth below, the grant of a security interest
or guarantee in respect of the relevant Additional Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the
transaction as valid.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which (i) the court application for an administration
order is issued, (ii) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court or (iii) otherwise, the date
on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding up petition is presented to the
court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding up resolution. Where
liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be determined by reference to commencement of
the initial administration.

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set forth more particularly below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions
at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of the company, (ii) a
shadow director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director or (iv) an associate of the relevant
company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner or (iv) the husband,
wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a
person has control of one and persons who are his or her associates, or he or she and persons who are his or her
associates have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the
groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same person by treating (in
one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he or she is an associate.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and security interests.

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court
for an order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company (or give other relief) on the

289


-----

grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. The
grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company receives no
consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth,
than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be
granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in Section 240 of the
Insolvency Act, as amended). A court will not generally make an order in respect of a transaction at an
undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of
carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction
would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an
undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the
transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting
aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the
transaction and has acted in good faith for value). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or
liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the
transaction was a “connected person” (as defined in the Insolvency Act, as amended, and as set forth in detail in
“—Connected Persons” above), in which case there is a presumption the company was unable to pay its debts
and the connected person must demonstrate the company was not unable to pay its debts in such proceedings.

**_Preference_**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a security interest or a guarantee granted by such company (or give other relief) on the grounds
that such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. The grant of a security interest or guarantee
is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better
position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been
granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending
with the onset of insolvency (as defined in Section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended) if the beneficiary of
the security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person, or two years if the beneficiary is a connected
person. A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied the company
was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for that person. Case law
suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if
they had the inevitable result of producing the better position. Subject to this, if the court determines that the
transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would
have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or
setting aside the security interests or guarantees). There is protection for a third party which benefits from the
transaction and acted in good faith for value. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to
demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a
desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in
which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect
and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made
for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a
company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is
making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This
provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction and is not therefore limited
to liquidators or administrators. If a company is in liquidation or administration, a victim must obtain permission
of the court before making any application. There is no statutory time limit in the English insolvency legislation
within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of
the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can
make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been
entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transaction_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court
can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English company up to three years before the day

290


-----

on which that company entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if,
having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to
require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect
of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Account Banks’ Right to Set off_**

With respect to English law governed charges over cash deposits (each, an “Account Charge”) granted by a
chargor over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each, an “Account
**Bank”) may have reserved their right at any time (whether prior to or upon a crystallization event under the**
Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or
other arrangement with that chargor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a
floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant
Account Bank’s netting and set off rights with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account
Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement
of the transaction security or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant chargor) the
Account Bank will no longer be entitled to exercise its netting and set off rights in relation to the account, except
where the Account Banks have expressly reserved set off rights.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of an English law governed Guarantee or security interest by any obligor guaranteeing or securing
(as the case may be) the obligations of another member of the Group must satisfy certain legal requirements.
More specifically, such transaction must be allowed by the respective obligor’s memorandum and articles of
association. To the extent these do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the Guarantee and
the subsequent Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some
comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an obligor in good faith; however, the relevant
legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Furthermore, corporate benefit must be established for
each obligor that is incorporated in England and Wales by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction.
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in
good faith, would be most likely to promote success of the relevant obligor for the benefit of its members as a
whole. If the directors enter into a transaction for which there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may
be found to have abused their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by
a court.

Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including where not governed
by English law) granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (together with prescribed particulars of
the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for
registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security
document. Such security, if not registered within the 21 day period, will be deemed to be void against a
liquidator, administrator and a creditor of the applicable chargor. Furthermore, failure to register also means that
the debt that was intended to be secured is deemed to have become immediately payable.

In the event the relevant security document is not registered, a chargor incorporated in England and Wales
may be required to enter into a new security document and register that with Companies House within 21 days of
its creation.

Alternatively, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify the position and allow
the charge to be registered after the 21 day period has expired. This application can be made by a chargor
incorporated in England and Wales or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave
to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard
as to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the
position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for
registration of the security.

Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does
not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although it may still need to be registered with the
applicable asset registry).

Guarantees and security granted by a guarantor, security provider or a chargor which is incorporated in
England and Wales are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance
within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.

**_Grant of Floating Charge_**

Under English insolvency law, if an English company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result
of) granting a floating charge then such floating charge can be voided on the action of a liquidator or
administrator if it was granted in the period of one year ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in
Section 245 of the Insolvency Act, as amended). The floating charge will, however, be validated to the extent of
the value of the consideration provided for the creation of the charge in the form of money paid to, or goods or
services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same time
as or after the creation of the floating charge plus interest payable on such amounts. Where the floating charge is
granted to a connected person the charge can be challenged if given within two years of the onset of insolvency
and the prerequisite to challenge that the company is unable to pay its debts does not apply. However, if the
floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this
paragraph.

**_Schemes of Arrangement_**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the
compromise of a company’s liabilities where such company (i) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act
and (ii) has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

In practice, any foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been
found to be satisfied by the English courts where, among other things, the company’s centre of main interests is
in England, or the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents
have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law.

Before the court considers whether to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on a
detailed debt restructuring compromise. Such restructuring compromise can be proposed by the company or its
creditors. If 75% by number and 50% by value of those creditors in each relevant class present and voting at the
creditors’ meeting(s) vote in favor of the proposed restructuring compromise, irrespective of the terms and
approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, that restructuring compromise will be binding on all
affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme of
arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement. The decision whether or not to sanction a
scheme is then at the discretion of the court.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the centre of main interests of the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors is deemed to be in France, it would be subject to French proceedings affecting
creditors, including court assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings) and court
administered proceedings: either safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde financière accélérée); judicial
reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire); or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire).

Specialized courts exist for insolvency proceedings with respect to (i) debtors that exceed (directly or
through the companies under their control) (y) €20 million in turnover and 250 employees or (z) €40 million in
turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) commencement of
proceedings pursuant to the international jurisdiction due to the debtor’s main center of interests being in France.

Specialized courts also exists for conciliation proceedings initiated by a debtor that exceeds (directly or
through the companies under their control) (y) €20 million in turnover and 250 employees or (z) €40 million in
turnover.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and the protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the
Additional Notes and/or the Additional Notes Guarantees granted by Selecta SAS or Selecta Holding SAS (each
a “French Guarantor”) and corresponding security interests in the Collateral.

Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, if a debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark),
French courts shall have jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the debtor’s centre of main interests
is situated in France. In the case of a debtor who is a legal person, the place of the registered office shall be

292


-----

presumed to be its centre of main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. In determining whether the
centre of main interests of a debtor is in France, French courts will take into account a broad range of factual
elements.

The court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has
jurisdiction over all the other members of this group. Accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency
proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator for all proceedings in
respect of members of the group.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the
meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

French law No. 2019-486 dated 22 May 2019 on the growth and transformation of companies, known as
“loi PACTE,” authorizes the French government to transpose under French law the “Restructuring and
**Insolvency Directive” (Directive (EU) 2019/1023) by government order within two years from the publication**
of the loi PACTE, i.e. before May, 23rd 2021. This transposition should implied significant changes to French
insolvency law (such as the introduction of cross-class cram down, absolute priority rule, new classes of
creditors, etc.).

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for informational
purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be relevant to holders of the
Additional Notes.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below (i.e., in situations where the debtor may not be insolvent),
you could, like any other creditors, be subject to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s financial
position and the creditor’s needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two years the payment
dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of which is thus deferred or
rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate (but not lower than the legal rate, as
published annually by the French government) or that payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of
principal. A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending
enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due
during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge.

**_Insolvency Test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its due debts with its immediately available assets taking into account available credit lines,
existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court
ruling commencing the insolvency proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back
up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at
an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context
of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see “—The
_“Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings”)._

**_Court Assisted Proceedings—Mandat Ad Hoc and Conciliation_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of court assisted
proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main
creditors and stakeholders, e.g., an agreement to reduce or reschedule its indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice,_
mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see
“—Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law. They are carried out under
the aegis of a court appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself,
under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the

293


-----

mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or
her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be
negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by
the agreement or forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending
proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but
those that have agreed to take part in the proceedings usually decide not to do so. In any event, the debtor retains
the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see
“—Grace Periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally
approved by him or her. The order of the president of the court appointing a mandataire ad hoc is notified for
information purposes to the debtor’s auditors.

Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of
a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above) or has not been
insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law. They are carried out under the
aegis of a court appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the
supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur being
able to request an extension without exceeding a total duration of five months of proceedings). The duties of the
_conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade_
partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement
between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors
not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement or forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not
automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the
debtor to recover their claims but those that have agreed to take part in the proceedings usually decide not to do
so.

The debtor that received a formal notice to pay or against which a creditor initiated legal proceedings,
retains the right to petition the judge who commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period under
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods”), such decision being taken after hearing the
_conciliateur._

With respect to grace periods under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, pursuant to Article L.
611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during
the execution period of a conciliation agreement, impose grace periods on creditors having participated in the
conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for their claims that were not
dealt with in the conciliation agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of
the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular,
performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to
obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a
judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the
request of the debtor, if (i) the debtor is not insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) or the conciliation
agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency (cessation des paiements), (ii) the
conciliation agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the
conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the
same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above, except that in addition:

   - creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings (and as provided for in the conciliation
agreement), provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business
of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will
enjoy a priority of payment over all pre commencement and post proceedings claims (except with
respect to certain pre commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money
**Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or**
judicial liquidation proceedings;

   - in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization proceedings, claims
benefiting from the New Money Lien may not, without their holders’ express consent, be written off
and their payment date may not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or
reorganization plan is adopted (whether such a debt reduction or payment deferral may be imposed by
the bondholders’ general meeting to bondholders having provided new money is the subject of debate);

294


-----

   - the works council or employee representatives are informed of the content of the conciliation
agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the
court. The publicly available court decision approving such agreement will, however, only disclose the
amount of any New Money Lien and the guarantees and security interests granted to secure the same;

   - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is transmitted to its
statutory auditors; and

   - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of insolvency (see “—Insolvency Test”), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as
defined below; see “—The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and
_Liquidation Proceedings”), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval_
(homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de
_l’accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_

   - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

   - the debtor retains the right to petition the court that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a
grace period pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods”), in relation
to claims of creditors (other than public creditors) party to the conciliation proceedings that are not
already subject to the conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having
heard the conciliateur (provided that the terms of his or her appointment included monitoring the
implementation of the agreement, as referred to above); and

   - a third party which had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect
to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as
from grace periods granted in the context of conciliation proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of
the court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation
proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual
proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement
are suspended and/or forbidden. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically
put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the
payments already received) and preexisting security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings in which a draft plan is supported by a large majority of creditors which is likely to
meet the threshold requirements for creditors’ consent in safeguard, will be a mandatory preliminary step of
accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the mandat ad hoc or conciliation
proceedings have been consulted on the matter, the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be appointed with
a mission to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor’s business, particularly through a “plan for the disposal
of the business” (plan de cession) which could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial
reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers
received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in
the context of safeguard, reorganization or liquidation proceedings after consultation with the state prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an
ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation
of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end
or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the
commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three quarters of the fees of the professional advisors
retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void.

**_Court Administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor that experiences difficulties which it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent
(see “—Insolvency Test”). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, or invited to attend the hearing before the

295


-----

court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of
safeguard proceedings, a court appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is (except for small
companies, for which the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to investigate the
business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision
commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court makes a decision on the outcome of the
proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court appointed administrator is also to assist the
debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate to its creditors.
Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by
the court appointed administrator. Nevertheless, up to five creditors may request the court to be appointed
controllers. The court appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him
or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the
debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the
court.

In addition, the court may convert such proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) after
commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or
the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) before
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own initiative or
upon request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in a
case where the debtor becomes insolvent or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the
creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee
and, if any, bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly
impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end. At any time
during the observation period, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the
debtor becomes insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible.

As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to
the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for
prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or
to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the
safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt for equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the
court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. In any case, a creditors’
representative (mandataire judiciaire) is appointed by the court in order to register creditors’ claims and protect
their collective interest in the judicial proceedings.

_Standard consultation: This applies to: (i) debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor_
(commissaire aux comptes) or prepared by a chartered accountant (expert comptable), or, if they are, (ii) debtors
that have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less.

In such cases, the court appointed administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court
appointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the
debt remissions and payment times proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal
commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is
justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court appointed creditors’
representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of
claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum possible length of
the plan (ten years).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors which do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than
debt for equity swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of

296


-----

the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court appointed administrator and the
controllers.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to
them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform
rescheduling of their claims (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over
a maximum period of ten years (except for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the
court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt for equity swap
may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5%
of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the
initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the
amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in
accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

_Committee based consultation: This applies to larger companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory_
auditor or established by a chartered accountant and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than
€20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the court appointed administrator’s request and with the consent of the court
in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’
committees which are established by the court appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior
to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

   - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in
favor of the debtor (the “credit institutions committee”); and

   - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the
claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the
court appointed administrator (the “major suppliers’ committee”).

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including
capital market debt instruments such as the Additional Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such
debt securities will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part
irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations.

Each committee votes at a two-third majority of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee. Accordingly,
a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee.

The proposed plan:

   - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

   - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

   - may, among other things, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime
of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt for equity swaps (debt for equity swaps
requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the creditors may subscribe to such share capital increase by
way of set off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where
applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions’ committee or of the major suppliers committee may
also prepare an alternative safeguard plan that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general
bondholders’ meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two
thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by the
court appointed administrator. Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period
may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority
vote of each committee (two thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote).

297


-----

Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform
the court appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or
(ii) the full or partial payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court
appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the
creditors’ committees/bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon
by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court
appointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In
addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a
payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do
not need to be consulted on the plan or take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval
to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two third’s majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’
committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of
creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved
(arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that
required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the
safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who
did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting are consulted by the
creditors’ representative in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above.

If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting
within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they
reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court appointed administrator
for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the
committee based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within
the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones
applicable for the standard consultation process described above.

If the court empowers the court appointed administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in order to take
corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s by laws (including modifications of its
share capital) required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’
decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders
own at least half of the shares with voting rights.

If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general bondholder
meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the
prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceeding into judicial reorganization proceeding if it appears
that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the safeguard proceeding would certainly lead to the
debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations, social_
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that
are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed
in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or
mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the
framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). Tax
administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As for indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from
default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Court Administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_**

A debtor which is the subject of conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed
to “fast track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those which publish:

   - consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or

298


-----

   - which publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant
and have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT) or
(iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the total
duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the duration of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is only one month (unless the court decides to extend it by an additional month). However, certain
provisions relating to ongoing contracts and provisions relating to the recovery of assets by owners benefiting
from title retention clauses do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings.

In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to vote on the
proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of
accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for
rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt for equity swaps
requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their
consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or that are not bondholders.

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions’ committee and
bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until the adoption of a plan through
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom
the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts
(including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after their
commencement if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or the debtor’s
business activities during the observation period (post commencement non privileged debts). Such amounts may
be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms.
Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and
suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to
be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms.

To be eligible for accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the
debtor must fulfill the following conditions:

   - the debtor must not be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) for more than 45 days when it
initially requested the opening of conciliation;

   - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement
of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or the accelerated financial safeguards proceedings;

   - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a
position to overcome;

   - the debtor must exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above) or the
court shall have authorized such constitution in the opening decision; and

   - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a
going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render
likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial
accelerated safeguard proceedings) and the bondholders’ general meeting, if any, within a maximum of
three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a
maximum of two months, following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and not approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the
court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the
committee process.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be
deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as

299


-----

applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make
such a filing (see below).

**_Court Administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may be
initiated by the public prosecutor, a creditor, or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation
proceedings only, if the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial
reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of
becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are
exposed to civil liability if it fails to do so.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after
having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order
the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the
debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial
reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings
observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative
(mandataire judiciaire) or the state prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial
reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the
time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having
heard the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the state prosecutor and the
workers’ representatives (if any).

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up
to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor with the debtor’s help, or the sale of
the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making
management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management
and control of the debtor (mission d’administration).

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, committees of creditors and a bondholders’ general
meeting may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings (see above). In particular, the
rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan
(plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see
above).

At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court appointed
administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the state prosecutor or at its own initiative,
order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its
recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is
decided by the court.

In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the
shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the
French Commercial Code, the court may appoint a court officer (mandataire de justice) whose mission will be to
convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders who refuse to vote in favor of such a
resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third
party(ies), providing new equity and undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no
reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court appointed administrator, can order the
total or partial transfer of the business.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within
the meaning of the French labor code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the
disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and (iii) the
modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or
regional economy and allows the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then following (x) the
review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and at the request of the court appointed
administrator or of the state prosecutor and (y) at least three months having elapsed as from the court decision
commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of

300


-----

the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the
insolvency court may either:

   - appoint a court officer (mandataire de justice) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote
the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided
for in the reorganization plan; or

   - order the sale in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan of all or
part of the share capital held by the shareholders who refused the share capital increase and holding,
directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights
(including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s
shareholder meetings; the shareholders who accepted the share capital modification have the right to
withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the
transferees. Any consent clause is deemed unwritten.

In the event of a forced sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of
the reorganization plan.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, who is
generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial
liquidation proceedings and no maximum time period is provided by law to limit the duration of the judicial
liquidation process. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation
operations (mainly to liquidate assets and settle liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are
sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority ranking order for payment). The liquidator will take over the
management and control of the debtor.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

(i) an asset sale plan (in which case a court appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will
usually be appointed to manage the debtor and organize such sale of the business as a going concern);
or

(ii) a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

(a) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only));

(b) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers
have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to enter into
the sale agreement with the offeror); or

(c) in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process
whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being
disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to
implement this process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has
varied.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds
to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due
to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

   - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the
difficulty of selling the assets; or

   - if there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a court officer (mandataire de
justice) in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these
lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The “Hardening Period” (période suspecte) in Judicial Reorganization and Liquidation Proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than 18 months

301


-----

before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date
earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of
conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the
hardening period (période suspecte), which runs from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court
decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void while others are
voidable by the court.

   - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening
period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of
other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration,
contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the obligations of the other
party, payments of debts due but not payable at the time of payment, payments of matured debts in a
manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for
previously incurred obligations, provisional attachment or seizure measures (unless the attachment or
seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets
or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made by way of security for a debt
simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights
already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized
declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité).

   - Transactions which are voidable by the court (if the third-party knew that the debtor was insolvent at
the relevant time) include payments made on debts that are payable, transactions for consideration and
notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and
oppositions made during the hardening period. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no
consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six month period prior to the beginning of
the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings.

**_Status of Creditors During Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial_**
**_Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of insolvency proceedings triggers the
acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does not order
the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing contract (contrats en
_cours) are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of_
continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon
the opening of reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated
January 14, 2014, n° 12 22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court appointed administrator can unilaterally decide
to terminate ongoing contracts which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely,
the court appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations
even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its
contractual obligations post filing (and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to
other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings,
however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the
continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de
_cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such a case, the acceleration of the_
obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the plan for the sale of the business or on
the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

(i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts
providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer
be compounded);

(ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set off of related (connexes) debts and

302


-----

payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery
is justified by the continued operation of the business);

(iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings
unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor;

(iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered or
goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will
be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain
limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed
within one year of the expiration of the observation period;

(v) creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor
where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court
decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (a) to obtain an order for
payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court
determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (b) to terminate a
contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (c) to enforce the creditor’s rights
against any assets of the debtor except where such asset whether tangible or intangible, movable or
immovable, is located in another Member State in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon
would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 EU of
the Insolvency Regulation or Article 8 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (as defined); and

(vi) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of
payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en
_cours) will be required._

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the financial creditors who fall
within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be
payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of
proceedings must file a claim with the court appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the
publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales);
this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for
the post commencement non privileged debts, with respect to which the two—or four month period referred to
above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the
relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with
the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’
representative with the list of all its creditors and all their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’
representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim
with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of
claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also
file their own proofs of claim.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of
the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory
auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may
also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as
set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors who did
not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or
reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial
reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated the repayment of its
creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor,

303


-----

the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditors’ representative) in charge of selling the assets of
the debtor and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where the sale
of the business is considered, the court will usually appoint an administrator to manage the debtor during the
temporary continuation of the business operations (see above) and to organize the sale of the business process.

If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business, it can also set a time period during which the assets
that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees,
post commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials, fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien
(see above), post commencement creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of
judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by
real estate are paid prior to post commencement creditors.

**_Creditors’ Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may only be held
liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting of such facilities was
wrongful, in the case of (i) fraud, (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) if the security or
guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or
guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be
cancelled or reduced by the court.

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of a French Guarantor is subject to:

   - certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial
Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French
Commercial Code; and

   - French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from extending credit or guaranteeing
indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the
guarantee must be in the corporate purposes and corporate interests of the guarantor company. Pursuant to French
corporate benefit rules, a French Guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction
involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee
unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient
return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a
real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the
benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by a French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be
limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Additional Notes to the extent
directly or indirectly on lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly
on lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and
outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any
payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor
shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its
subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French
Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Additional Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees.

**_Rights in the Collateral May be Adversely Affected by the Failure to Perfect Security Interests in the_**
**_Collateral_**

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on

304


-----

the Collateral securing the Additional Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Additional
Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens.
Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any responsibility or
obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of
French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of
pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are
registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge
(déclaration de nantissement de compte de titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security
Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte
_d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of a French Guarantor. In France, no lien_
searches are available for security interests that are not publicly registered, with the result that no assurance can
be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of Security Interests and Cash Amount (soulte)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account or in the form
of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being
paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured
creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed
extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the
context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure.
If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor will be required to pay the
pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and
the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by
the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount
owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale
price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold
pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the
vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition
of companies or groups of companies.

**_Parallel Debt—Trust—French Security Agent_**

Under French law, the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by
such security interest are required to be the same person. Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third
parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the
French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under new Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code.

The ordinance No. 2017-748 dated May 4, 2017, relating to security agent (ordonnance n° 2017-748 du 4
_mai 2017 relative à l’agent des sûretés) clarifies and modernizes the status of the French security agent by_
repealing the former Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code and by creating a new regime for the agent
specifically designated for the purpose of taking, managing and enforcing security interest and personal
guarantees in the context of financing arrangements. This new regime applies to security agents appointed after
October 1, 2017. New Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security
interests and personal guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately
from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees
will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in
cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal
actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a

305


-----

debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying
its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

The beneficial holders of interests in the Additional Notes from time to time will not be parties to the
Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Additional Notes to benefit from a secured
claim, they will be provided for by the creation of “Parallel Debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the Additional
Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt
and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant
to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an
obligor under the Additional Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt,
and may not directly secure the obligations under the Additional Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the
Collateral. The holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such
security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the
security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10 25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed
by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing
of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French
Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not
contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the
basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel
Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a
recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that
such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue
addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French
security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on
a case by case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in
France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the
Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of
the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will bear the risks associated
with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following
defaults or events of default, and acts as trustee in the interests of the holders of the Additional Notes.

The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de
_cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_
n°10 25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New
York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while
substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985
on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally
recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of the Security Agent. To the extent that the security
interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully challenged by other parties,
holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of
the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will bear the risks
associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

French law contains specific action paulienne provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and
outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means

306


-----

of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which
such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides
security for any of such debtor’s or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from
existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency
proceedings of such debtor by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the
safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan) or by any of the creditors of such debtor
outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence
of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third
parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case
of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of
the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction
knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such
knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Additional Notes, the grant
of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of an Additional Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent
conveyance, then the issuance of the Additional Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or
the granting of such Additional Notes Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared
unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such
successful challenges, holders of the Additional Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Additional Notes, the
Additional Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that
holders of the Additional Notes received with respect to the Additional Notes, the security interests in the
Collateral or the Additional Notes Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the creditor having initiated
the action paulienne. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Additional Notes might be held liable
for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent
conveyance.

**_Recognition of Intercreditor Arrangements by French Courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court (Cour
_de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the Intercreditor_
Agreement, except for Article L. 626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that, in the context of
safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or continuation plan that is put to the vote of the
creditors’ committee takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements
between creditors that were entered into prior to the commencement of the proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received no
judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of Validity of Second or Lower Ranking Financial Securities Account Pledges by French Courts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or lower
ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over
the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company
are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests that are not registered in official
ledgers, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a
company are registered.

**_Assumptions as to the Enforceability of Second Ranking Bank Account Pledges Over the Bank Accounts_**

Certain pledges over bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are available
for security interests that are not registered in official ledgers, such as pledges over bank accounts. As a result, no
assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant bank accounts of a company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account from granting
a second, or lower ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has not been tested before the
French courts and no assurance can be given that such second, or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if
tested.

**_Limitation on Granting of Security Interests and on Enforcement Under Italian Law_**

The secured creditors under the Collateral are, among others, the holders of the Additional Notes from time
to time and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited (in its capacity as the Trustee of the Additional Notes).

Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the
relevant security document. Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of
the individual holder of the Additional Notes, Italian security documents are created, and the Collateral governed
by Italian law will therefore be granted and perfected, in favor of the Trustee and in favor of the Security Agent,
acting in its capacity as legal representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) of all secured creditors (including
the holders of the Additional Notes) under the Intercreditor Agreement. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian
courts whether under Italian law a security can be created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors (such as the
holders of the Additional Notes from time to time) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security
documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or
public registries; and (ii) in favor of the Trustee since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under
Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Trustee as
agent or trustee for holders of the Additional Notes under security interests granted over Italian assets is
uncertain under Italian law.

In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414-bis,
paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests can
be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Additional Notes who will then be
authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the Additional Notes. However, there is no guidance or
available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a
_rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_
the holders of the Additional Notes which are neither directly parties to the security documents nor are
specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In
addition, there is no guidance or available interpretation on how such a new provision may be applied to security
created to secure bond issuances made by a non-Italian entity.

Given the above and considering that the holders of the Additional Notes are not party to the Italian law
governed security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Additional
Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are
not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the Italian law
governed security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest.

The validity of parallel debt structures under Italian law has, to date, not been considered before the Italian
courts and the security interests comprising the parallel debt claim could be held to be in conflict with mandatory
provisions of Italian law. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the enforceability of a security interest
governed by Italian law securing a parallel debt obligation will be upheld by an Italian court and further, no
assurance can be provided on how an Italian court would interpret an Italian law security instrument purporting
to secure, inter alia, a “parallel debt” obligation.

The procedures for the enforcement of Italian law security and the timing for obtaining judicial decisions
(including in relation to security enforcement) in the Republic of Italy are materially complex and time
consuming, especially given that the Italian courts maintain, in general, a significant role in the enforcement
process, in comparison to other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

If a security interest is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or
restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. For a description of such issues, see “—Financial
_Assistance” below._

**_Other Enforcement Limitations_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be time consuming in a liquidation scenario.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and
security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential
challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness,
avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law (as defined below) and the relevant law on the non-insolvency
avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect

308


-----

period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an
insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations” below. If challenged successfully,
the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to
the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the
Additional Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any
amounts under the related security documents.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general
may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

   - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors;

   - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the
availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court;

   - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each
party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to
perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460
of the Italian Civil Code;

   - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian
law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be
or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;

   - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the
correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or
fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;

   - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in
its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is
based on reasonable grounds and in good faith;

   - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be
limited by the fact that the relevant provisions of laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy
principles or mandatory provisions of Italian law;

   - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or
instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or
instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would
survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

   - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

   - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may
be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to
the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

   - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to
save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of
intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of
such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

   - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the
purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil
Code are satisfied, see “—Financial Assistance”;

   - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest
being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis, see “—Corporate Benefit and
_Corporate Authorization”;_

309


-----

- under Italian law each guarantee needs to expressly provide for a maximum amount payable by the
relevant guarantor thereunder, as mentioned in Paragraph “—Guarantee and Security Limitations”
below;

- in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding
under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors cannot start or continue individual
foreclosure actions (including, with some exceptions, the enforcement of security interests) against the
debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such
receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

- in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to
the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date
(data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that
a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by
one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document,
another way is to have each page of the document stamped by the post office through a particular
modality (piego raccomandato aperto);

- the priority rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the
date of the relevant seizure, attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure
or attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover,
to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of
the forced sale in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings;

- a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant security provider other than the pledgee
from starting or continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the
relevant pledge, although the relevant pledgee remains entitled to priority over the proceeds of such
liquidation if it intervenes in the enforcement procedure pursuant to the applicable civil procedure
rules;

- in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the
pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and,
as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the
pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the
pledged quotas or shares;

- pursuant to Article 2744 of the Italian Civil Code any agreement which provides that on failing to pay a
secured debt the ownership of the pledged asset will be transferred to the creditor is considered void;

- changes or amendments to contractual documentation may constitute a novation (novazione) of the
relevant document. The question whether a contractual document may be novated or not is primarily a
function of the nature and the extent of the changes, notwithstanding any contractual provision to the
contrary and a matter of interpretation of the intention of the parties, reserved to the Courts;

- in light, amongst other things, of the above paragraph, the extension of existing security or the granting
of new security interests in connection with the issuance of new notes or in connection with
modifications to the secured obligations (including, for the sake of clarity, the extension of the existing
pledge agreement over the shares of Argenta in order to secure the indebtedness under the Additional
Notes also) or the completion of new perfection formalities may give rise to new hardening periods for
such security interests. The applicable hardening period for such security interests would run from the
moment each security interest has been granted, perfected, extended or recreated;

- various claims, collectively referred to as privilegi, are given statutory priority under the Italian Civil
Code against the claims of the other creditors in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property. These
are classified as either privilegi generali (general privileges or liens), which apply only in respect of all
personal property of the debtor, or privilegi speciali (special privileges or liens), which apply only in
respect of particular (immovable or movable) property. Some of these claims have mandatory priority
and would therefore be preferred to the secured creditors in case of an insolvency proceeding. Such
claims include, for example, courts costs, mandatory social security contributions and credits of the
Government for taxes;

- the enforceability of subordination clauses in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding is untested before
Italian courts and, accordingly, the receiver or the insolvency trustee may disregard the subordination

310


-----

provisions contained in the documentation and distribute the proceeds pursuant to the rules applicable
to the relevant bankruptcy or insolvency procedure; and

   - any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian
mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest
exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996
(i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and
regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not
comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued
and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in
the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement
executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993
(i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can
be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a
guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a
clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results
in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other
act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said
guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to
make the two following findings:

(i) that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor,
or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently
designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

(ii) that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the
act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the
fraudulent design.

If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it
unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to
the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.

**_Corporate Benefit and Corporate Authorization_**

Under Italian law, the entry into a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the granting of
a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the applicable laws and the
company’s by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with the rules on corporate benefit, corporate
authorization and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a security interest or a guarantee is being
provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or restructuring, financial assistance issues may
also be triggered.

An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must
receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such
company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and its existence is
purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is
to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances
and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into
consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted
to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the
validity and effectiveness of upstream or cross-stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to
secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by
an entity organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit
in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the
grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from granting such guarantee or security. The general rule is that
the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or
indirect economic benefit to it. In particular, in the case of upstream and cross-stream guarantee or security for
the financial obligations of group companies, examples include financial consideration in the form of access by
the relevant company to cash flow through intercompany loans from other members of the group (especially

311


-----

when derived from the same transaction secured or guaranteed by the relevant Italian company), while
transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and,
therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged
for, lack of corporate benefit and, conflict of interest.

The absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including the granting of a security
interest or a guarantee granted by an Italian company) ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest.
Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best
interests of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or
were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition
of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having
knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the security interest granted
by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to
be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interests of the Italian company.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream and downstream guarantees or security
interests granted by Italian companies.

In addition, the guarantee granted by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy must
be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the
guarantee and will not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Guarantor. It has been held that such
determination must be proportionate to such Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional
to the assets of the relevant Guarantor, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void; however, it is
uncertain whether courts are entitled to debate and rule over such determinations.

**_Financial Assistance_**

The granting of a security or a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would
result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Articles 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the
Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial
assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or
subscription by a third party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls
the Italian company. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and
void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company.
Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own
shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation.

More specifically, Italian rules on financial assistance, provided under articles 2358 and 2474 of the Italian
Civil Code, prohibit the grant by the Guarantor organized in Italy (the “Italian Guarantor”) of guarantee or
security interests in respect of indebtedness incurred for the acquisition (or the refinancing of the acquisition) of
such Guarantor’s own shares or quotas, or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls such
Guarantor. In light of these rules, the liability of each Italian Guarantor under its guarantee or security interests of
the Additional Notes is expressly limited to an amount corresponding to the principal amount of the financial
indebtedness of the relevant Italian Guarantor to be repaid through the proceeds of the Additional Notes, in order
to exclude from the relevant guaranteed/secured obligations any portion of the proceeds of the Additional Notes
incurred or utilized for the purposes indicated above falling within the prohibition under the Italian financial
assistance rules. This “virtual tranching” structure (i.e., whereby the relevant portion of the proceeds of the
Additional Notes which do not constitute “acquisition debt” and, therefore, do not fall within the prohibition
under Italian financial assistance rules, are identified, but not actually separated into a separate tranche of
financial indebtedness) is untested in Italian courts. Therefore, it may be deemed insufficient for clearly
distinguishing and separating the non-“acquisition debt” portion of the proceeds of the Additional Notes
distributed to Italian Guarantor, and it may result in the relevant Guarantee violating the provisions of articles
2358 and 2474 of the Italian Civil Code. If an Italian court determined that such a violation had occurred, it
would result in the guarantees by the Italian Guarantor being null and void, which would mean that holders of the
Additional Notes would have no recourse to the assets of the Italian Guarantors and no claim against the Italian
Guarantor in an insolvency or other scenario.

**_Guarantee and Security Limitations_**

In light of the considerations made above, in order to comply with corporate law requirements on corporate
benefit and financial assistance and other Italian mandatory provisions of law: (i) the maximum amount that a

312


-----

Guarantor incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy may be required to pay in respect of its
obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement; and (ii) the obligations secured by security documents granted by Italian companies, will be subject
to limitations.

In particular, as a result of the abovementioned limitations in relation to Italian financial assistance law and
corporate benefit, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, with respect to
guarantees given by Argenta, the amount indicated under paragraph (i) above shall not exceed at any time an
amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of (i) €201.0 million (being an amount equal to the proceeds of
the offering of the Existing Notes on-lent to Argenta) and (ii) the aggregate maximum amount of any
intercompany loans, or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including
equity contributions), made available from time to time to Argenta (or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer and/or any other member of the Group (whether
directly or indirectly), whether or not outstanding at the time of enforcement of the Guarantee, net of any
proceeds already paid by Argenta pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantees in relation to the Revolving
Credit Facility and/or pursuant to the enforcement of any guarantee issued by Argenta under any Senior Secured
Finance Document (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). It will be additionally specified that financial
indebtedness under the Additional Notes the purpose or the actual use of which is to finance, directly or
indirectly, the acquisition of Argenta (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) and/or the subscription
of any shares or quota in Argenta (or any of its direct or indirect holding companies) (or to refinance, directly or
indirectly, any existing indebtedness incurred for such purposes) and/or the payment of any fees, costs and
expenses, stamp, registration or other taxes in connection therewith shall not be guaranteed by the Guarantee
given by Argenta. Similar limitations will apply in relation to any security interests granted by Argenta.

However, we cannot provide any assurances that holders of the Additional Notes will be able to recover
even these amounts under such Guarantees, as payment under each Guarantee is contractually subordinated to all
the senior indebtedness of such Guarantor. In addition, the proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees shall
be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the
Additional Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of
the Additional Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Note Guarantees and security.

Additionally, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued by an Italian
Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount.
Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the
guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture).

In light of the above, and without prejudice to the other limitations indicated above, pursuant to article 1938
of the Italian Civil Code the maximum amount that a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of the Republic of
Italy may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as a Guarantor under its Guarantee will not exceed 150%
of the amount of the Additional Notes (or its equivalent in any other currency).

**_Other Limitations_**

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered a restricted financial activity within
the meaning of Article 106 of the Italian Banking Act, which is exclusively reserved for banks and authorized
financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others,
entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Ministerial Decree No. 53 of
April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of
guarantees or security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group is
not considered as carried out vis-à-vis the public, and as a result does not qualify as a restricted financial activity,
whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian
Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above
described rules, subject to the Guarantor and the entity in favor of which the relevant guarantee is given being
part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial
activity.

Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to
protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this
respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or
exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company, (ii) any entity subject to the
management and coordination powers of the same person, or (iii) a quota holder in the case of a company

313


-----

incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that
borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the
kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to
its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan
(“undercapitalization”). The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally
conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided
to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, some court precedents have
held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni,
hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are società per azioni. Additionally,
according, inter alia, to certain recent case law of the Italian Supreme Court, the above subordination rule of
intercompany loans would apply also during the life of the company and not only in case of the opening of a
voluntary or insolvency liquidation and, as a consequence, the company (and the relevant directors) should not
repay intercompany loans granted in presence of the conditions described above set out by Article 2467 of the
Italian Civil Code, until the situation of “undercapitalization” (as described above) is overcome by the relevant
company.

Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts
may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the
relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian
subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should
any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the
obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able
to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries (including the
Guarantor), which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations
under the Additional Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any
intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Additional
Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees granted
by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.

Pursuant to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code, any payment made by the borrower with respect to any
such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower.
However, such part of Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code has been repealed by the Code (as defined in “—
_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations” below) which will become effective as of August 15, 2020. In_
this respect, Article 164 of the Code shall provide that repayments of loans granted by the shareholders to the
company (in the situations described above as provided under Article 2467, second paragraph, of the Italian Civil
Code) are ineffective vis-à-vis the other creditors if made after the filing of the request following which an
insolvency proceeding has been opened or in the previous year and that the same provision applies to repayments
of loans granted in favour of the company subject to bankruptcy (liquidazione giudiziale) by a person that
exercises management and coordination powers (attività di direzione e coordinamento) over that borrowing
company or any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person. Article 164 of the
Code does not expressly refer to companies incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata only.

Additionally, according to Article 292 of the Code, receivables (also deriving from the enforcement of
guarantees) owed by a company to the person that exercises management and coordination powers (attività di
_direzione e coordinamento) over that company or owed by the latter to the relevant company (i.e., up-stream_
financings) deriving from financings entered into after the filing of the request following which the bankruptcy
has been opened or in the previous year are subordinated to the satisfaction of the other creditors (unless such
financing falls into the categories of super priority financings (finanziamenti prededucibili) described in section
“Interim financing” below) and that, if such receivables have been repaid in the year preceding the opening of the
bankruptcy (liquidazione giudiziale), Article 164, described above, applies. Article 292 of the Code does not
expressly refer to: (i) companies incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata only; and
(ii) financings granted in a situation of “undercapitalization.”

In any case, it should be noted that the Code has not come into effect yet and no case law nor significant
scholars are available in relation to the above new provisions of law regulating intercompany loans and
consequently the description above and the interpretation of the above provisions of law (also as to their
connection with other general provisions of law) remain subject to some, unavoidable, degree of uncertainty.

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurers and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved
activities nor does it provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws applied where public companies are
involved. In October 2017, new general rules and principles of Italian insolvency law were enacted, as guidelines
for the new Italian code of corporate crisis and insolvency (hereinafter, the “Code”).

The Code was enacted by Italian legislative decree no. 14 of January 12, 2019, but most of the relevant
provisions of law will be effective as of August 15, 2020. The provisions of the Code (with a few exceptions)
will not be applicable before August 15, 2020. Also, they have not been tested to date in the Italian courts and
their interpretation is uncertain. Furthermore, we expect that the Code will be further and significantly amended
and supplemented prior to its date of becoming effective (i.e. August 15, 2020) and the interpretation of the
relevant provisions thereof could change from time to time. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, no
guidance, official position or interpretation has been provided or taken by the Italian legislator, by any court or
by any other competent authority in Italy. The drafts of the legislation available before the date of its enactment
do not offer any assistance in the interpretation of the provisions of the Code, the drafting of which is, in several
aspects, very different and totally new in comparison to the previously applicable Italian insolvency legislation.

In general terms, the Code offers more efficient, early and flexible corporate reorganization and
restructuring tools aimed at business continuity, where possible. The new rules and provisions of the Code are
aimed at ensuring, among other things: (i) earlier emersion of the distress situation, through certain preventive
restructuring remedies (early warning); (ii) concordato preventivo (composition with creditors) proceedings as a
tool for restructurings based on business continuity (as opposed to liquidation); (iii) a new concept of judicial
liquidation, with a replacement of the expression fallimento (bankruptcy); (iv) more fast and cost effective crisis
and insolvency proceedings, on the basis of a single judicial process; and (v) special rules on the insolvency and
restructuring of group companies.

In the following paragraphs we will outline some of the new provisions of law set forth by the Code, bearing
in mind that they could be further amended and supplemented by the Italian legislator, even prior August 15,
2020. The two primary aims of Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy
legislation), as amended and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) are to liquidate the debtor’s
assets protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) or the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case
of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims often
have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along
with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to
promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially
distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or
one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer
able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status, in
order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

Only corporations whose indebtedness and assets values exceed certain thresholds are subjected to
bankruptcy proceeding (as further indicated). Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020) new provisions
of law are aimed at managing situations of crisis or insolvency of group companies, considering that single and
separate proceedings may be prejudicial to the restructuring and recovery of the group, as well as to business
continuity. In particular, it is allowed the filing of a unique petition for composition with creditors or debt
restructuring agreement, on the basis of either a unique plan, or different, but related and connected plans (one
for each group entity), in order to ensure full cooperation and coordination of proceedings, as well as a better
satisfaction of creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the general principle of separation of assets and liabilities of each
entity of the group is still applicable, but it could be mitigated in the event the plan provides certain acts
(including intra-group transfers), provided that an independent expert certifies that such acts are required for the
purposes of the business continuity, and aimed at a more profitable distribution to all creditors.

The new rules and provisions of the Code are aimed at ensuring, among other things, an earlier emersion of
the distress situation, through certain preventive restructuring remedies. In this framework, the Code provides for
early warning tools and crisis management proceedings, which are out-of-court, confidential legal mechanisms.

315


-----

In particular, early warning tools are alert obligations upon certain subjects and entities, which are aimed at
a prompt detection of crisis indicators, as well as a quick adoption of the more appropriate measures, in addition
to the internal organizational models adopted by the companies and their corporate bodies. The crisis indicators
could be any economic or financial imbalances, also considering the dimension and history of the company, and
the kind of business activity carried out by the same, arising from certain indexes of business continuity and
sustainability of debts for a certain timeframe. Early warning tools are activated through a notice sent by:

   - the control bodies (internal auditors or external auditors, where provided) to the directors of the
company, with a short term for the adoption of the required remedies; lacking any reply or action from
the directors, the control bodies shall inform the so called OCRI (i.e., “Organismo di Composizione
della Crisi d’Impresa”), an independent body for the management of crisis situations; or

   - qualified public creditors (e.g., Tax Agencies and Social Securities Contributions Authority) to the
debtor, in the event of indebtedness exceeding certain indebtedness thresholds; if the indebtedness is
not cured, or actions are not taken by the debtor within a certain timeframe, the above mentioned
creditors shall inform OCRI.

OCRI is entitled to summon the debtor and, if a crisis situation occurs, to suggest any possible measures to
be adopted further to an out-of-court, confidential and quick process. In the framework of such crisis
management proceedings, the same debtor may request OCRI to facilitate an agreement with creditors aimed at
the restructuring of the indebtedness. In any event, the same debtor is entitled to promptly request the opening of
a confidential crisis management proceedings before the OCRI, also in order to benefit from certain reward
measures.

In addition to the above, the following pre-insolvency proceedings are currently available under Italian law
for companies facing financial difficulties or temporary cash flow shortfalls and, in general, financial distress.

Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for three models of pre-insolvency proceedings: (i) court pre-bankruptcy
composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo),_ (ii) debt restructuring agreements (accordi _di_
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) (“DRA”); and (iii) certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento)_
(“CRP”). Under the EU Insolvency Regulation both pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo) and DRA are listed in the relevant Annex A._

It should be noted that all of the above-mentioned pre-insolvency proceedings often require creditors to
compromise on their right to be fully satisfied. The debtor may offer to creditors partial settlement of their
claims.

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable to the
debtor and because out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring (other than
those put in place under the safe harbor of an out-of-court reorganization CRP pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph
3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which exempts—provided all actions indicated in the plan are fully
implemented—from insolvency claw-back and from certain criminal law provisions on bankruptcy those
transactions executed as part of the CRP) are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent
insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger civil or criminal liabilities in the
event of a subsequent bankruptcy.

_Certified Restructuring Plans Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (piani_
_attestati di risanamento)_

Out-of-court CRPs are based on restructuring plans prepared by debtors for the purpose of restructuring
their indebtedness and ensuring the recovery of their financial condition, the feasibility of which, together with
the truthfulness of debtor’s business (and accounting) data, must be assessed by an independent expert directly
appointed by the debtor. The expert can only be selected and appointed from among those possessing certain
specific professional requisites and qualifications (e.g., being registered in the auditors’ registrar), and meeting
the requirements under Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code. The expert may be subject to civil and criminal
liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification.

CRPs are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be
filed with the court or other supervising authority. CRPs do not require to be approved and consented to by a
specific majority of all outstanding claims. Following a CRP, there is no entrusting of a business to another
entity; therefore, the debtor remains entitled (during the negotiation as well as the execution of the CRP) to
manage its business.

316


-----

The terms and conditions of the CRPs are freely negotiable. Unlike in pre-bankruptcy composition with
creditors (concordato preventivo) and DRA proceedings, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the
debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors (in
particular during the CRPs negotiation). The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and
the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of CRP, subject to
certain conditions (i) are not subject to claw-back actions; and (ii) are exempted from the potential application of
certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies’ register are needed
(although, upon request of the debtor, a CRP can be published in the relevant companies’ register), and,
therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy
agreement or a debt restructuring agreement.

Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020) the CRP shall have the following requirements: (a) certain
date (“data certa”); (b) detailed description of the plan, on a legal and economic standpoint; and (c) need of a
new certification from an independent expert in the event of amendments to the plan, as well as of adjustment
mechanisms.

_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law_
_(accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_

Out-of-court DRAs entered into with creditors representing at least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts
must be ratified (omologati) by a court. An independent expert, directly appointed by the debtor, must assess—in
addition to the truthfulness of the debtor’s business and accounting data—that the agreement is feasible and, in
particular, that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within 120 days from (i) the
ratification (omologazione) of the DRA by the court, in case the relevant claims are already due and payable to
the non-participating creditors as of the date of the ratification of the DRA by the court or (ii) from the date on
which the relevant debts fall due, in case the relevant claims are not yet due and payable to the non-participating
creditors as of the date of the ratification (omologazione) of the DRA by the court.

Only a debtor who is in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial distress which does not yet
amount to insolvency) can initiate such process and request the court’s confirmation (omologazione) of the DRA,
which must be entered into with creditors representing not less than 60% of the company’s debts.

The DRA, which may consist of separate agreements reached with each creditor, must be published in the
Italian companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such
publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions
over the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing claims and cannot obtain any new and additional security
interest (unless agreed) in relation to the pre-existing debts. Such moratorium can be requested, pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor to the court pending negotiations with
creditors (prior to the DRA’s execution and publication) subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. The
court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the
publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the
creditors. In such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium are in place and,
if they are, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security
interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days)
within which the restructuring agreement has to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of
its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below)
may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the
debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business
by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing
agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. A DRA may also contain a proposed tax
settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain overdue taxes, as provided in Article 182-ter of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the
publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if
any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The
Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding
debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of DRA, easing the requirements with respect to financial
creditors.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as
amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are

317


-----

entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at
least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement
binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to
certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other
available alternative. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating
financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down
creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the
classes of creditors.

Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial
creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the nonparticipating financial creditors, provided that an independent expert certifies the homogeneity of the classes and
subject to certain conditions being met. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from block
restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall
restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may
challenge it within 30 days of receipt of the application.

Such DRA and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g. trade creditors)
who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to
the approved DRA (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy priority status in
cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to
80 percent of such financing).

Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a DRA or a court-supervised
Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by
the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval
of the plan or ratification (omologazione) of the agreement.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the ratification
(omologazione) of the agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, or after the filing of the petition
pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, or a petition for a concordato preventivo, also pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 6, may authorize the debtor to:

(i) incur new pre-deductible indebtedness subject to authorization by the court and if an expert certifies that
such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process, (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem
securities (garanzie reali), provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial
needs of the company until the ratification (omologazione), declares the aim of the new financial indebtedness
results in a better satisfaction of the creditors; and (iii) pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods,
already payable and due, provided that, the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the
company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions
of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before
the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring
agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo)
outlined below.

Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the
ratification (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called
pre-deducibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The
company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing;
(ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail
an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.

Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020), the percentage of 60% of creditors provided for the
approval of the DRA could be halved to 30% in the event (i) the DRA does not provide a moratorium for external

318


-----

creditors, and (ii) the debtor did not request (and waives to) temporary protective measures. Furthermore, the
certification of the independent expert shall be updated and renewed in the event significant amendments occur
to the DRA and relevant plan. As a new provision of the Code, special rules would apply in the event of
extension of the effects of a DRA to external creditors (at least equal to 75% of creditors of the concerned class),
provided that: (a) creditors have been fully informed; (b) the plan is aimed at business continuity and creditors
will be mainly paid with the proceeds arising from the continuation of business activities; and (c) external
creditors are paid no less than in a liquidation scenario.

With reference to the new rules on financings set forth by the Code, please refer to Section “Interim
Financings” below.

_Interim Financing_

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain
authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines
(linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy
Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di
_ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_
expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, inter alia, the relevant
debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such finance
would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within ten days of the filing
of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal
creditors.

Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato
_preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_
expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is
provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status.

Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020) new provisions of law have been enacted in relation to
interim financings (including guarantees and self-liquidating credit lines) granted before the approval of the
_concordato preventivo or DRA, in the event of continuation of business activities (even only for the purposes of_
liquidation), for a better satisfaction of creditors and with a priority status. The company, while filing such
request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise
obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable
prejudice to the company. It is required the certification of an independent expert that such financing meets the
above mentioned requirements, as well as that such financing is aimed to the best satisfaction of creditors, unless
the Court states there is a matter of urgency in order to prevent an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the
business. In the event of subsequent opening of liquidation proceedings, the financings will not enjoy the priority
status if granted on the basis of false data, lack of information or fraudulent acts from the debtor, and awareness
of such circumstances is proved.

Furthermore, in the event of continuation of business activities also interim financings granted in execution
of concordato preventivo or approved DRA (and expressly provided in the relevant plan) enjoy the priority
status. In the event of subsequent opening of liquidation proceedings, the financings will not enjoy the priority
status if granted on the basis of false data, lack of information or fraudulent acts from the debtor, and awareness
of such circumstances is proved.

Also financings (including guarantees) granted by shareholders meet priority status, up to 80% of the
relevant value (100% of the relevant value if the financing party becomes shareholder in execution of concordato
_preventivo or DRA)._

In the event of direction and coordination activity, any intercompany claims arising from financings granted
after the filing of the petition for the opening of liquidation proceedings or during the preceding year, are
subordinated to the satisfaction of the other creditors. Such claims are not effective vis-à-vis creditors if they
have been returned during the year prior to the filing of the petition, or after such filing.

_Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)_

A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e. financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to

319


-----

compose its overall indebtedness or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the
initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which
exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount
exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an
aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total
indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a
_concordato preventivo (together with, inter alia, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing_
the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by
the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register.

From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all
enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the
_concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and_
interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot
obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding
the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective
against such pre-existing creditors.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and
payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it shall ensure payment of
at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the
going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or
affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and
debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the
composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the
partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary
petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Law No. 98/2013 (“Law
**Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the**
latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective
receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within
a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition,
subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring
agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary
petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in
the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law
(e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities
or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject
the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the
company during the above-mentioned period.

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two
years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the
presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the
financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the
application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse
of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial
position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register.

Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being
declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant
requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried
out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the
restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial
commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents.

320


-----

Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with
creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the
court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent.
Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness
authorized by the court, pending the ratification (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to
Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application
pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to
Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs
related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law
132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called pre-deducibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action
provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of
the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the
composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the
term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding
opened with the filing of the preliminary petition.

The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the
debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets
which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuit`a aziendale). In these
cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as
a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and
support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of
the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition
proposal was not implemented.

Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the
winding-up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also
contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to
supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’
meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who shall authorize all
transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business).

The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote
of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the
plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The composition with creditors is
approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015
abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and
those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are
deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise
their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the
minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will
be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the
proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato
_preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets_
(such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of
their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the
circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the
court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to
other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the
creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled
to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’
claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise
be the case.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for
individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the

321


-----

aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy
agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular,
that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured clams (crediti
_chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio),_
or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based
on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a
pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e. a pre-bankruptcy
agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their
interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least
20% of their claims.

This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going
concern (concordato con continuità aziendale).

To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant
special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by
taking all corporate actions required.

In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended
by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),
pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the
debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may
request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of
the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by
the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventive proposal by issuing a confirmation order.

If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the
public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company
bankrupt.

Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020), the concordato preventivo may still also be allowed as a
liquidation tool, provided that certain conditions are met (i.e., new external financings granted so as to enable a
certain level of recovery for creditors, and payment of at least 20% of creditors’ claims). Furthermore, in the
_concordato preventivo aimed at preventing the insolvency declaration, and favoring business continuity, the_
Code provides the benefit of business continuity only in the event it would imply (i) a significant increase of the
financial resources available to creditors, (ii) an employment level equal to at least half of the average number of
employees in the past two years, for at least one year after the judicial approval, and (iii) the satisfaction of
creditors mainly with the proceeds of the business continuity (including assignment of inventory).

**_Bankruptcy (fallimento)_**

A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) and
the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by the debtor company itself, any of its
creditors and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor.

Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly
meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. The bankruptcy is declared by the competent
bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori
_commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in_
an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross
revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years;
and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, among other things:

   - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a
defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the
secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out
of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will
be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The
secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated

322


-----

judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the
designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

   - the administration of the debtor company and the management of its assets pass from the debtor
company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare);

   - any act of the debtor company done after a declaration of bankruptcy (including payments made) is
ineffective against the creditors;

   - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage
to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to
creditors; and

   - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over.

Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts
where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to
specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a
deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of
any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the
creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority
rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the
debtor’s assets include real estate. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence
the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of
payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy
proceeding and costs related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security
contributions and employee arrears of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory
provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as
those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian
bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law).

Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020), the expression “fallimento” has been replaced by a new
concept of judicial liquidation, on the basis of a more fast and effective proceedings, as well increased powers of
the receiver and more focus on liquidation of assets and businesses.

**_Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato fallimentare)_**

A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with
creditors. The relevant proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the declaration of
bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year
following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities
account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare,
unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not
receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an
independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal.

The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment
among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The
_concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the_
majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority
of the classes). Final court ratification is also required.

Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020), the concordato fallimentare has been enhanced, with an
increased role of third parties and creditors.

**_Statutory Priorities_**

The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from that
established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor

323


-----

the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by
subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be
noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may
not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities
provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the
sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset.

Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated
according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre-deductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the
insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged,
such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law,
the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors
including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing,
mentioned above), the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for
employee wages. The remaining priority claims are those of “privileged” creditors (creditori privilegiati; a
priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori
_ipotecari), pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari)._

**_Avoidance Powers in Insolvency_**

Under Italian law, there are “clawback” or avoidance provisions that may lead to, inter alia, the revocation
of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key
avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential
transactions and transactions made with a view to defrauding creditors. Clawback rules under Italian law are
normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy, compared to the rules applicable
in other jurisdictions.

In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a
clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of
extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the clawback period can
be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other
transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions that are ineffective by
operation of law and acts or transactions that are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court
commissioner, as detailed below.

_Acts Ineffective by Operation of law_

(a) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions
entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the
two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is
ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate
by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without needing
to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may
challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law; and

(b) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day of the
declaration of insolvency or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if made by the debtor
in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration.

_Acts that Could be Declared Ineffective at the Request of the Bankruptcy Receiver/Court Commissioner_

(a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed
back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the above referenced Royal
Decree and be declared ineffective unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into:

(i) the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the
value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds by 25% the value of the
consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor;

(ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other
customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration;

324


-----

(iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the insolvency
declaration in order to secure preexisting debts which have not yet fallen due; and

(iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding the insolvency
declaration, in order to secure debts which had fallen due.

(b) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed
back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the other party knew that
the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

(i) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered
into or made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration; and

(ii) the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) and made in the six
months preceding the insolvency declaration.

(c) The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions:

(i) a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with
market practice;

(ii) a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards
the bank in a material and lasting manner;

(iii) a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil
Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is
intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of
kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the
purchaser, on the condition that, as of the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is
actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out;

(iv) transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect to the
bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di risanamento
_attestato (see “—Certified Restructuring Plans Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the_
_Italian Bankruptcy Law (piani attestati di risanamento)” above);_

(v) a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a concordato
_preventivo (see “—Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato_
_preventivo)” above) or a DRA under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Debt_
_Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy_
_Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)” above) and transactions entered into, payments made_
and security interests granted after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo (see
above);

(vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and

(vii) a payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to
services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases,
the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared
without effect vis- à-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback
period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a
creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to
the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor,
provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered
into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, that such transaction was
fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and
that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person
was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the
creditor’s claim originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent scheme). Burden of
proof is entirely with the receiver Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the
Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to
certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets
from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement
proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/

325


-----

nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried
out without consideration (e.g. gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts
or the so called fondo patrimoniale—“family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the
enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser.

_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi_
_imprese in stato di insolvenza)_

An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial
enterprises (the Prodi-bis procedure). The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious
recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in
the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial
statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors,
the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration
procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’
claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings.

There are two main phases: “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.”

_Judicial Phase_

In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it
is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissiario
_giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or_
reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within ten days from such
filing, the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the “Ministry”) may make an opinion on the admission of the
company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of
the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy.

_Administrative Phase_

Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative
phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The
extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going
concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to
the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the
“Recovery Plan”). The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an
issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato).
The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner.

In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition
and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which
the company is declared bankrupt.

_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di_
_insolvenza)_

Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the Marzano
procedure. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same
provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example,
although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry is made together with the filing to the
court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have at least
500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt. The decision of
whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file
an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are
met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides
on the company’s insolvency.

326


-----

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a
Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be
completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery
Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings.

_Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain
companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies,
credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative
winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy
court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active.

The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds
expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities
concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory
provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator
(commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a
steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy
court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this
procedure. The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under
bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for
bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary
administration proceedings.

**Spain**

Certain of Selecta’s subsidiaries in Spain guarantee both the Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, with
certain limitations due to Spanish mandatory rules and practice (each, a “Spanish Guarantor”). Pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, any proceeds from the Spanish guarantees received by the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement will be shared with the lenders in respect of certain hedging obligations and holders of
the Additional Notes on a pari passu basis.

**_Spanish Insolvency Law_**

The Spanish Insolvency Act 22/2003, of July 9, as amended (the “Spanish Insolvency Act”) regulates
insolvency proceedings, as opposed to out-of- court liquidation (which, pursuant to Spanish corporate law, is
only available when the debtor has sufficient assets to meet its liabilities). The Spanish full-blown insolvency
proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as “concurso de acreedores,” applies to all persons or entities (save
for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Act). These proceedings may lead
either to reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (the
“Composition Agreement”) or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets.

_Insolvency Filing_

A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the bankruptcy petition upon inability to
regularly pay its liabilities as they become due. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for such
insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due. Creditors do
also have standing to petition bankruptcy when the debtor is unable to regularly pay its debts as they come due.

Bankruptcy is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor requests the
bankruptcy, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a petition for bankruptcy
within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency (inability to
regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless
otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency
occur. Where the debtor fails to file a petition for bankruptcy within the time period established by law (two
months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by a bankruptcy authority once the
bankruptcy is declared and the bankruptcy process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain
courses of action (including, inter alia, the possibility of submitting a pre-arranged settlement proposal); and

327


-----

(iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency, should
the debtor be liquidated and bankruptcy be classified as “guilty.”

Bankruptcy is considered mandatory or involuntary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third party. Under
article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if it can prove
that the debtor has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amount owed. A creditor may also
apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the court: (i) a generalized default on payments by the debtor;
(ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets; (iii) a misplacement, “fire
sale,” hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax,
social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e. three months).

_Pre-Insolvency Filing_

Spanish law currently contains a restructuring moratorium proceeding known as article 5.bis pre-bankruptcy
proceeding, which is an insolvency proceeding under both Spanish and European regulation. It protects the
debtor, for a four-months period, from petitions for involuntary cases.

The general duty to file for bankruptcy within the referred two-months period does not apply if the debtor
notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support to reach a
pre-arranged composition agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado) or an out-of-court workout (a
refinancing agreement) set out in Section 71.bis.1 or in the Fourth Additional Disposition of the Spanish
Insolvency Act (the so-called 5 bis communication). Effectively, by means of the 5 bis communication, on the
top of those two months, the debtor gains an additional three-months period as from the date when the debtor
gives such notice, to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition
agreement and one further month to file for bankruptcy, if after the above mentioned period of three months has
elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such period of time,
creditors’ petitions for involuntary cases will not be accepted.

Additionally, during the four-month protection period provided for by 5. bis notice (or three months
according to certain case law), enforcement will be prevented: (i) by creditors, other than public, over assets
which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business; and (ii) by financial creditors referred to in the
4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act over any asset, provided financial creditors holding at
least 51% of the financial indebtedness (by value) of the insolvent debtor have expressed their will to commence
negotiations in order to reach a refinancing agreement and have committed not to initiate or continue
enforcement proceedings against the debtor.

Further, any outstanding enforcement action which falls into the above categories that was commenced
before the filing for a pre-insolvency moratorium will be suspended.

**_Enforcement and Termination in a Pre-Insolvency Scenario_**

The obligations under the Additional Notes and the Guarantees might not necessarily be enforced in
accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia, the
nature of the remedies available in the Spanish Courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion
of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the Spanish Law on Civil Procedure
(Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil) regarding remedies and enforcement measures available
under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Act and other principles of law of general
application. In this regard:

   - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Section 1,152 of the Spanish
Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will
substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an
event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts may modify the penalty agreed on an
equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty
(liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be
disproportionate according to the good faith principle). There is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain
of punitive damages.

   - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in
Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.

   - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the
discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce
terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties.

328


-----

   - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being terminated on the
basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or
complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment
obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish Courts not to enforce any such
termination.

   - Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said
acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in
circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided
shall apply.

**_Effects of Bankruptcy Declaration_**

_Effects for the Debtor_

As a general rule, the debtor in a voluntary case retains its management power, but is subject to the
intervention (intervención) of the insolvency trustee (administrador concursal), who is appointed by the court. In
the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced (sustitución) by
the insolvency trustee. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific
circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency trustee’s request, the court has the power to swap the
intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any
required supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null and void.

_Effects on Contracts_

Bankruptcy declaration does not affect contracts with reciprocal obligations pending performance by both
parties by bankruptcy declaration (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations
of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate (con cargo a la masa). The Court can
nonetheless terminate (reject) any such contracts at the request of the insolvency trustee (provided that
management’s powers have been solely conferred upon the insolvency trustee), the company itself (if its powers
to manage and dispose of its business are only subject to the intervention of the insolvency trustee) when such
termination is in the interest of the estate (resolución del contrato en interés del concurso), or terminate for
breach at the request of the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such contract. The termination of
such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return consideration received or indemnify its
counterparty against the insolvency estate. On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the
insolvent debtor at its request or the insolvency trustee’s request (assumption) (mantenimiento del contrato en
_interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall have a estate claim._

Creditors will be able to accelerate, but not to terminate executory contracts based only on bankruptcy
declaration (declaración de concurso) of the debtor. All clauses in contracts with mutual obligations that entitle
any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency (ipso facto
clauses) are deemed as not included in the agreement (void) and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly
permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws).

Additionally, bankruptcy declaration suspends interest accrual, except for:

(a) Postpetition interests, which are only payable to secured creditors (up to the value of the collateral)
where those were included as contingent debt in the proof of claims (Spanish Supreme Court ruling of
February 20, 2019) and insofar the interest refer to ordinary, but not to default interest (Spanish
Supreme Court ruling April 11, 2019). These two Spanish Supreme Court rulings have given rise to a
significant degree of controversy (pending to see whether this new line or argumentation is confirmed
or fine-tuned, and whether there is any say on the retroactive effects); and

(b) any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the
corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado).

In any event, setoff is prohibited unless the requirements for the setoff were satisfied prior to the declaration
of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a law that permits set-off.

As a general rule, bankruptcy declaration stays, up to a year, enforcement proceedings tied to collateral
necessary to pursue the ordinary course (excluding financial collateral, as defined in Royal Decree Law 5/2005,
which can be enforced as any time, and where the collateral is located outside of Spain).

329


-----

The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary to the continuation of the commercial
or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until the earlier of: (i) an
arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the composition agreement does not affect
such right; or (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of the
liquidation phase.

Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the
holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset,
are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the
relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not bring about an early
termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset.
When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the law extends the jurisdiction of
the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is, then, legally authorized to handle any enforcement
proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative
law).

_Ranking of Credits_

The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them within
a one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette (Boletín Oficial del
_Estado) of the court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by providing original documentation that_
justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held by the debtor, the
insolvency trustee draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories
established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims against the debtor’s estate; (ii) claims benefiting from
special privileges; (iii) claims benefiting from general privileges; (iv) ordinary claims; and (v) subordinated
claims.

(a) Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) from Section 84 of the Spanish
Insolvency Act sets out the so-called “estate claims” which are pre-deductible claims from the estate
(excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security), are generally payable when
due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other claims). Debt against the
insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and
expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts deriving from executory contracts and
obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor,
(iv) those amounts that derive from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency
proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration
received by it, if tied to bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising
from obligations created by law or from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of
insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration
of insolvency; (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a Composition
Agreements in accordance with article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, (viii) 50% of the new
funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth
in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act; and (ix) the new funds
lent by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor in the context of a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th
Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act, provided further that such new funds do not result
from a share capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose.

(b) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially in rem
_security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem_
_securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the_
creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured
asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act minus senior
claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the
nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings,
though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year from
the declaration of the insolvency and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency
Act. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended
under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the relevant claims
against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to

330


-----

Composition Agreement, unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition
Agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which
represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total
value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. In the event of
liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the secured assets on which they are secured.

(c) Claims benefiting from general privileges include, among others, certain labor debts and certain debts
with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax debts and
social security obligations and debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency
proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, are recognized as privileged for up to
50% of the amount of such debts. New funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into in
compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the
Spanish Insolvency Act in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (crédito
_contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to_
be affected by the restructuring (under a Composition Agreement) except if they give their express
support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not give such express
support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or
75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting
from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. If they do not
agree to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the
order established by law).

(d) Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a pro-rated basis from
the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former pre-deduction of estate claims and
generally privileged claims.

(e) Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue
of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor. In
the case of individuals, this includes their relatives, legal entities controlled by the debtor or its
relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such legal entities, any other legal entity forming part of
the same group of companies and the legal entities in respect of which the people described in this
paragraph are their factual and legal administrators. In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be
deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such
shareholders are natural persons it would include any specially related party to these shareholders, as
described herein); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the
insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed)—when the shareholder is an
individual, those who would be specially related to the individual are also specially related to the
debtor; or (iii) directors (either de jure or de facto), liquidators and those holding general powers of
attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held these position during the
two years prior to the insolvency declaration); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the
debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding
requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or
indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a refinancing
arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 71.bis or the 4th
Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered as being in a special
relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted
under such refinancing arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees
or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be
persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two
years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open.

Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they do not vote on the Composition Agreement and in
the event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act (once
ordinary creditors have been paid in full).

_Hardening Periods_

There is no automatic claw-back by virtue of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that
automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency trustee may
only challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” to the insolvent debtor’s estate,

331


-----

provided that they have taken place within two years prior to bankruptcy declaration, even in the absence of
fraudulent intent (in accordance with Article 71.7 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, transactions taking place four
years before the insolvency declaration are subject to the general regime of rescission set forth in the Spanish
Civil Code).

“Detriment” does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the
debtor’s interests. Pursuant to the law, (a) detriment exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption, without admission
of proof to the contrary) in the case of (i) disposals without consideration, except for ordinary largesse
(liberalidades de uso) and (ii) early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the insolvency declaration
(except secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption) in the case of
(i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship with the debtor, (ii) the creation of in rem
rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those incurred to replace existing obligations and (iii) the
cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem security falling due after the declaration of insolvency. In the
remaining cases, detriment would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission.

Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other
group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests may be
considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible
and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group
interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called “group interest”).
Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the guarantor is detriment to the
guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis (the beneficiary of the
guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the
validity of upstream guarantees.

If a rescission action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together
with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor, the
counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the time of
their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith, the liable party
will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be classified as
subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to
the debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate
as per bilateral contracts.

The exercise of rescission actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance with law,
which may be brought before the bankruptcy judge.

Under no circumstances can be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary
course of the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out under market conditions;
(ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values
and derivative instruments; and (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in favor of
the labor authorities.

Neither “Refinancing Agreements,” nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any
guarantees instituted in the performance of such “Refinancing Agreements,” will be subject to an action for
rescission, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in section ‘Protection of Certain
Refinancing Agreements’ and they have been sanctioned (homologado) by the competent Court.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_**

Under Spanish law, in addition to the bankruptcy clawback action, the insolvency trustee and any creditor
may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against its debtor and the
third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided the same is performed or entered into
fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is
not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor
to bring such action:

   - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after
such debt was created;

   - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

   - such act was fraudulent;

332


-----

   - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages
suffered; and

   - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s
estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under
Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code:
(i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for
consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose
assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The
presumption referred to in (i) above is a juris et de jure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the
presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the consideration received
under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to
carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third
party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such
damages.

**_Protection of Certain Refinancing Agreements_**

Certain refinancing agreements denominated “Collective Refinancing Agreements” may be protected from
claw-back risk provided that they comply with certain requirements further explained in the section referred to as
“—Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements.”

In the case that such refinancing agreements are not subject to the procedure of judicial sanctioning therein
described (homologación), they may still have certain (but not total) protection against clawback, if they are
backed by at least 3/5 (60%) of the total claims of the insolvent debtor (calculated on an individual and on a
consolidated basis but excluding intragroup claims). Among other requisites, the refinancing agreements must be
founded on a viability plan reflecting that the insolvent debtor will be viable in the short and medium term and
must comply with the rest of requirements explained below.

**_Cramdown Effects of Certain Refinancing Agreements_**

In order to seek protection against clawback, refinancing agreements can be judicially sanctioned
(homologado) by the commercial court that will be competent to conduct a potential bankruptcy proceeding,
upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, if (i) they entail a
significant enlargement of debtor’s credit or a change in the debt structure by either granting a longer term or
replacing previous claims with new ones with longer maturity dates; (ii) they have been subscribed by creditors
holding financial liabilities representing, at least, 51% of the debtor’s financial liabilities whether or not subject
to financial supervision (that is to say the Spanish Insolvency Act excludes public creditors, labor creditors and
those of commercial transactions in order to calculate whether the required thresholds are met) at the date of the
refinancing agreement; (iii) the debtor’s auditor issues a certificate acknowledging that the required thresholds
have been reached (in the case of a group a companies, pursuant to certain precedents, the majority arguably
refers both individually to each company and to the group as a whole -where the intercompany claims are not
taken into account-), and when the company has no auditor, by the one appointed for this purpose; and (iv) the
agreement is formalized in a public instrument and the documents that validate its content must be attached.
Judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements will not be subject to the bankruptcy claw-back action, but they
may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law.

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an
interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably voted
upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the
syndicated loan agreement. Whether or not dissidents can be extended effects beyond those provided by the law
or object to homologation, and whether they have standing to object to homologation, is controversial.

333


-----

The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting
or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the extent of that part
of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in accordance
with the rules set out by the latest reform of the Spanish Insolvency Act and (ii) dissenting secured creditors in
respect of their secured claims, provided they achieve the thresholds mentioned below:

(a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of
the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or the debt
converted into so-called profit participation loans (préstamos participativos) of term up to five years.

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or
dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured
claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

(b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the
debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities:

(i) stays of payments for up to ten years;

(ii) haircuts;

(iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing
agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may choose
between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or, as default option, (ii) a
discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the
shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant
debt for equity swap;

(iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations,
subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking,
maturity and features different to the original debt; and

(v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio
_pro solute or datio pro solvendo)._

Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting
creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which
represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.

**_Applicable Jurisdiction_**

The applicable jurisdiction to conduct an insolvency proceeding is the one in which the insolvent party has
its “centre of main interests.” This “centre of main interests” is deemed to be where the insolvent party conducts
the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which may be recognized as such by third parties.
Insolvency proceedings conducted by the court of the “centre of main interests” are considered “the principal
insolvency proceedings” and have universal reach affecting all the assets of the insolvent party worldwide, with
certain exceptions, such as security interests over assets located outside of Spain. If the “centre of main interests”
is not in Spain, but the insolvent party has a permanent establishment in Spain, Spanish courts will only have
jurisdiction over the assets located in Spain (the “territorial insolvency proceedings”).

In the event Spanish courts have jurisdiction, article 87.3 of the current Spanish Insolvency Act may apply,
in which case the claims of the beneficiaries of the guarantee provided by a Spanish Guarantor may be classified
as “contingent” claims and no amount may be recognized until and when a default occurs and the guarantee is
validly enforced. Nor will they have voting rights. Special rules can apply if the guarantee is not a first demand
guarantee but an ordinary guarantee (fianza) and, therefore, the benefits of preference (excusión), order (orden)
and division (división) apply.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforcement of the Additional Notes Guarantees and Security Interests_**

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee or security interest must guarantee or secure a primary
obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security
agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the
ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary obligation terminated, the ancillary
guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and void. In the event that the guarantor or security

334


-----

provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts
may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security
agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without
having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the
guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment,
novation or extinction of the secured obligations.

A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of
minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a
default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be
left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code.

Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Additional Notes or to
grant security interests over its assets to secure the Additional Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not
constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a guarantee or the
value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other
companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the
Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, there are rulings from the Spanish Supreme Court recognizing the validity of upstream guarantees.

Furthermore, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under its Additional Notes Guarantee or under any
security instrument granted by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of
the Spanish financial assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under the
Additional Notes Guarantee or any security granted or executed by such Spanish Guarantor:

   - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Additional Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares
representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its
direct or indirect parent company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares
representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its
direct or indirect parent company; and

   - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same
would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and Article 143 of the
Spanish Companies Law and, in that case, all provisions of such Additional Notes Guarantee or
security shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Additional Notes Guarantee
or security given by the Spanish Guarantor provides any such unlawful financial assistance.

Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas
_(S.A.)) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company,_
and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), in relation to the
acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law
governed guarantees or security interests granted or assumed by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of
Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of
such Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of
their group, to the extent that such security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the
meaning of Article 150 and 143 of Spanish Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 on Spanish Corporations (Ley de
_Sociedades de Capital). This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt, although this is_
widely debated between academics. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish
subsidiary shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such
existing indebtedness was used for the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available.
Accordingly, the guarantee granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are
not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes.

Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when
guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant
Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will
need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to
reestablish the balance between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare
its insolvency.

In addition, and whilst this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that certain
defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer,

335


-----

voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the
Additional Notes Guarantee by reference to the net assets and share capital of the Spanish Guarantor and the
amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of the collateral.

Under the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el
_texto refundido de la Ley, de Sociedades de Capital), Spanish companies (both public limited liability companies_
(sociedades anónimas (S.A.) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada
_(S.L.)) may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that_
recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de
_responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)). In particular, pursuant to Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the_
Guarantee provided by Spanish Guarantors incorporated under the form of limited liability companies
(“sociedades de responsabilidad limitada” or “S.L.s”), is subject to the following restrictions: (a) S.L.s can only
issue and guarantee notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless
the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit
institution (b) S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes convertible into quota
shares (participaciones sociales).

In respect of the restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad
_limitada (S.L.)), there is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding the_
interpretation of Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act.

Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (five years being the general term established for
obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become
subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim.

The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination
thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type
enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all
circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to:

   - the nature of the remedies available; and

   - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived), circumvention of
law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force
majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim.

Spanish law does not recognize the concepts of “trust” or “security agent” and there is some uncertainty as
to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a security agent (including the Security Agent) and
whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce the
collateral as provided in the relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the
Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish
court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation.
Some legal scholars argue that a security agent (such as the Security Agent) or a trustee (such as the applicable
Trustee) would only be entitled to enforce its portion of the secured obligation but not that of the other secured
parties. Therefore, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through
the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, and enforcement thereof by the Security Agent and/or the
applicable Trustee, may be subject to a due and express power of attorney granted by each of the secured parties
in favor of the Security Agent and/or the Trustee for such purpose, duly notarized and legalized (and, if
applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961).

Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the
Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not
been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly
contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of
the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the applicable Trustee and
the holders of the Additional Notes may be challenged.

According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in the
place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as receivables
or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical existence. In
these cases, several theories have been construed amongst Spanish scholars so as to determine the lex rei sitae
(such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing the credit right

336


-----

being pledged, etc.). If a judge considered that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish
security documents is governed by the Catalonian Civil Code, then this regulation would govern those pledges
instead of the Spanish civil common law, which could determine the challenge of the validity of such pledges.

The concept of “parallel debt” may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any court
precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court.

Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive
summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain,
having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario).

**Sweden**

**_Applicable Insolvency Law_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden and as such any insolvency
proceedings applicable to such Guarantor, including any and all of its assets (in Sweden and abroad), will, as a
matter of Swedish law, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

In addition, a Swedish party will in principle be subject to insolvency proceedings covered by the EU
Insolvency Regulation (which includes all collective insolvency proceedings available under Swedish law in
respect of bodies corporate) if it has its centre of main interests (“COMI”) in Sweden. The COMI is presumed, in
the case of a company or body corporate, to be the place of its registration as a legal person. Accordingly, if the
Swedish party is registered in Sweden, Swedish courts will be entitled to open main insolvency proceedings
against it and apply the laws of the relevant insolvency proceedings. If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member
State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State
(other than Denmark) may open “territorial insolvency proceedings” or, after the commencement of main
proceedings, “secondary insolvency proceedings,” in the event that such debtor possesses an “establishment” in
the territory of such other Member State.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

In the event of bankruptcy the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy who will work in the interests of
all creditors with the objective of selling the debtor’s assets and distributing the proceeds among the creditors.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s
creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to
safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all
creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and
to distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company
and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or
dispose of the company’s assets.

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of
Priority Act (förmånsrättslag (1970:979)), as amended from time to time, which states the order in which
creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have an
equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However,
preferential or secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other creditors.

In the case of enforcement outside bankruptcy, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining
an enforcement order from the Swedish Enforcement Authority or the court. Upon obtaining an enforcement
order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim.
If agreed upon between a pledgor and a secured creditor and the secured creditor or its agent is in physical
possession of the security assets, the agent may under certain circumstances enforce the pledge without the
involvement of the Swedish Enforcement Authority or a court. A provision granting the secured party or its agent
such right of enforcement is typically included in any pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured
party or its agent.

**_Priority of Certain Creditors_**

As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to payment in
relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, some preferential and secured
creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment

337

before other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general preferential rights. Specific
preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a right to payment from such property.
General preferential rights cover all property that belongs to the insolvent company’s estate in bankruptcy, which
is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. Claims
that do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for
such claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other.

**_Challengeable Transactions_**

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and
subject to a time limit) be reversed and the goods or monies can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the
company which is subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others,
situations in which the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the
detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security
interest, granted a guarantee or security interest that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured
obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or
paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is
made by using unusual means of payment.

In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during the
three months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain situations, longer
time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other
party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor such as a
subsidiary or parent company.

**_Limitations on Enforceability Due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

The Reorganization Act (Lag (1996:764) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing difficulties
in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve such without being declared bankrupt.
Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement
but may, and often is, extended for several additional three-month-periods.

An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day to day activities and safeguards the
interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except
that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization,
granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or
granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is
required. However, if the debtor fails to comply with the restrictions it will not affect the validity of such actions
taken.

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor.
The Reorganization Act, rather, contains specific rules that restrict termination of contracts due to breaches of
contractual obligations that occurred prior to the instigation of the reorganization and, during the reorganization
procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure
includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell due prior to the order
without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional
reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also
applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings
unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of
such creditor, which is the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where
the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent or with a Swedish law pledge over a loan
which is documented by a negotiable debt instrument (löpande skuldebrev).

The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (offentligt ackord), which
means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must meet
certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors that are allowed to vote, in respect of a
sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set off
rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set off
rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will,
however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The
public composition is binding on the proceedings.

**_Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee or Security Interest_**

_Corporate Benefit Rules_

If a Swedish limited liability company (a “Swedish Company”) provides any security interest or guarantee
without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, according to the
Swedish Companies Act (aktiebolagslag 2005:551) (the “Swedish Companies Act”), in whole or in part, be
considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only to the extent that there is sufficient coverage for the
unrestricted equity capital of the relevant Swedish Company after the distribution (i.e., at the time the guarantee
is provided or the security is granted).

The Guarantees of and security granted by the Guarantors incorporated in Sweden are limited in accordance
with the above restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting the
liability of such entities thereunder if required by the above restrictions relating to distribution of assets.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Further, the Swedish Companies Act prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a loan or a guarantee or
security interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company itself or
in any other member of the same Swedish group of companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries) and,
subject to certain exceptions, a Swedish Company may not provide a guarantee or any security for the obligations
of a parent or sister company, unless the parent company of the group, to which the company and such parent or
sister company belongs, is domiciled within the EEA.

**_Creation of Valid Security Interests_**

In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law, the property subject to such security interest
must fulfil the following criteria: (a) there must be an underlying debtor-creditor relationship in respect of the
obligations which the security purports to secure; (b) the pledgor must grant the security interest, typically in the
form of a pledge agreement; and (c) an act perfecting the security interest must take place. The method for
perfection varies depending on the asset type. A Swedish share pledge agreement is perfected when the share
certificate(s) representing the pledged shares have been transferred to the pledgee’s possession or, if the share
certificate(s) are held by a third party, when the third party is notified of the pledge. In practice, a pledge over
shares is made through the delivery of share certificates duly endorsed in blank (to facilitate enforcement). A
notice is given by the pledgor to the company and the pledge is then registered in the company’s share register. A
Swedish intra-group loan pledge agreement is perfected by a notification to the debtor from the pledgor or the
pledgee. For the pledge to be perfected, the pledgor must also be deprived of any control over the collateral (i.e.
the contractual right to receive payments). If the receivables are evidenced by negotiable instruments, it may be
possible to perfect the pledge without a notification to the debtors. A pledge of a negotiable instrument is
perfected when the instrument is transferred to the pledgee’s possession or, if the instrument is held by a third
party, when the third party is notified of the pledge. As the Swedish law intra-group pledge agreement permits
payments of both principal and interest to the pledgor until an acceleration event has occurred, that security will
remain unperfected until the occurrence of an acceleration event and the satisfaction of the above perfection
requirements.

Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the
secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of
its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests
purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of,
retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the
occurrence of an enforcement event (or similar), such as the security over the intra-group loans described in the
preceding paragraph, would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security
interests have been duly perfected. Such unperfected secured assets are vulnerable under applicable provisions of
Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security
provider. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the
secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with
the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of
the security.

339


-----

**_Foreign Currency_**

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than the local currency but the judgment debtor
has the right under Swedish law to pay the judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in the
local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

**_Security Granted in Favor of an Agent_**

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf of
the secured parties.

However, it is not established by judicial precedent or otherwise by law that a power of attorney or a
mandate of agency, including the appointment of an agent (including any agent for service of process), can be
made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by
operation of law and without notice at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers. The
concept of trust does not exist under Swedish law and unless the Trustee is treated as the agent of the secured
parties, the security will be invalid should Swedish law be deemed applicable.

**Switzerland**

**_Bankruptcy and Insolvency_**

Several of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (the “Swiss Guarantors”). In the
event of any such Swiss Guarantor’s insolvency, insolvency proceedings may, therefore, be initiated in
Switzerland and Swiss insolvency law would then govern those proceedings. The insolvency and bankruptcy
laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act
(Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) (DEBA) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors
than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of
creditors to recover payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in
force.

Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept (with the exception of limited
coordination of related proceedings occurring in Switzerland by the involved authorities), which means there is
no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a
group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency laws point of view, to be dealt with separately, although
proceeding of group companies occurring simultaneously in Switzerland are coordinated where possible. As a
consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather
claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately.

Under Swiss bankruptcy law, bankruptcy proceedings are not initiated by the competent court ex officio, but
rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings based on an
application for commencement of enforcement proceedings and the threat of insolvency. Proceedings must
generally be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency law in the event that the debtor
has obviously and permanently stopped to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently, or is
attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also initiate bankruptcy
proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to Swiss corporate
law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed pursuant
to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the “CO”) and on the basis of a balance sheet to be
drawn up (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii) to the extent there is still a going
concern scenario—based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors’
claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going concern values, the debtor’s board
of directors has to notify the competent court, provided that creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate
their claims in the amount necessary to cover the over-indebtedness (Art. 725 CO). However, as soon as the
debtor loses the going concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern values become irrelevant and
over-indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over-indebtedness is
based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important to note that a debtor’s inability to pay its
debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the going concern assumption for accounting

-----

purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will typically result in overindebtedness. The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to notify the competent court without delay and
non-compliance with this obligation exposes board of directors to both damage claims as well as sanctions under
criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an
aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s over-indebtedness subordinate their claims against
the claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e., out-of-court)
workout within a relatively short period of time. It is not settled in Swiss case law as to how long such period of
time is supposed to be. However, many legal scholars consider such period to be four to six weeks. Finally, the
debtor’s auditors have the obligation to notify the competent court if the debtor’s board of directors has failed to
file for bankruptcy despite the debtor being obviously over-indebted. The competent court, upon being notified of
the over-indebtedness, opens formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) against the debtor unless there
are prospects of recovery in which case measures to preserve the assets of the debtor are ordered.

If a creditor wants to initiate bankruptcy proceedings it has to first file an application for commencement of
enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt).
With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or
resident (although, in special cases, other debt collection offices can be competent). The debt collection office
will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is virtually no material assessment of
the claim at this stage. The debtor may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an
objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No
reasons need to be given for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor of the objection.

For claims based on an enforceable judgment (including, among others, judicial settlements and orders), the
creditor can without any further delay file an application to lift this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren).
For claims not based on an enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the
claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung).
In the event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an
action in ordinary court proceedings for negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist
(Aberkennungsklage).

The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to issue a writ of continuation (Fortsetzungsbegehren)
in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent debt collection office
delivers this writ of continuation to the debtor. The competent court may take preliminary measures to secure
property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor’s rights. Within 20
days from receipt of the threat of insolvency (Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition the opening of
bankruptcy proceedings. The competent court decides upon the bankruptcy without any delay, provided that
there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the competent court’s decision. In addition, the debtor
has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the
competent court.

The competent court orders the continuation of bankruptcy proceedings if certain requirements are met, in
particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings. If the assets of the
debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the competent court will only order to continue bankruptcy proceedings
if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings themselves. In the absence
of such advancement, the bankruptcy proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des
_Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the debt collection office may request the competent court to_
resolve upon summary bankruptcy proceedings (summarisches Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient
to cover the cost of ordinary bankruptcy proceedings and the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Also, in
such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary bankruptcy proceedings.

Upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose
over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office
has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse), provided that certain acts
require the approval of the competent court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency
administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In
such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate.
The creditors’ committee has additional competences.

Bankruptcy results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those
secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon the opening of
formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy

341


-----

claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not yet due and not interest bearing),
interest accrued thereon until the date of bankruptcy, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon bankruptcy,
interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have
accrued until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral
suffice to cover such interests.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht)),
wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings in Switzerland.
Swiss bankruptcy proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their
individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of Swiss
insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest (except in
case of full title security as security assignments or transfers for security purposes (Sicherungsübereignungen))
outside the bankruptcy proceedings. In the bankruptcy proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain
preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security is vested with the insolvency
administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss bankruptcy laws which provide for a public
auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover
(i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors (with respect to the proceeds of their respective
collateral) and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors.

Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal
bankruptcy proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate. Thereafter, all other claims (bankruptcy
claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the
distribution provisions of Swiss bankruptcy laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such
as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for the government and its subdivisions based on
specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there
are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate after the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and
paid in full.

As an alternative solution to bankruptcy, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may seek a
composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court
(Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a tentative
reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium provisionally (provisorische
_Stundung) for a maximum period of four months or not, which may be followed by a definitive moratorium_
(definitive Nachlassstundung) of four to six months (extendable in special circumstances of up to 24 months).
With its decision the court appoints a commissioner provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case during the
period of the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a composition agreement
(Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court approves
the moratorium definitely and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where deemed necessary,
also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) for the purpose of supervising the commissioner. The
commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors (Gläubigerversammlung) which has to approve the draft
composition agreement according to specific majority rules. The composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is
subject to the approval of the composition court. The Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act
(DEBA) provides for three different types of composition agreements: (i) the ordinary composition agreement
(ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag) where the debtor’s business continues and the contractual terms of its payment
obligations are modified (Stundungsvergleich) or creditors receive a dividend (Dividendenvergleich), (ii) the
composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) and (iii) the
composition agreement in bankruptcy proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im Konkurs). The moratorium could also
result in a composition agreement that may comprise the formation of a new company (Auffanggesellschaft) to
receive part of the business of the debtor. During a moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated
and pending debt collection proceedings are stayed; certain exceptions may apply with respect to pledged assets.
In principle, interest ceases to accrue against the debtor for all unsecured claims. Furthermore, the debtor’s power
to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. The moratorium does not per se affect the agreed
due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication).

**_Fraudulent Transfer Provisions_**

Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration (Konkursverwaltung) and certain creditors may,
under certain conditions, challenge transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of or the payment under any
guarantee or security or, if a payment has already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that
the recipients return the amount received to the debtor’s estate. In particular, a transaction (which term includes

342


-----

the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other
creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in
damages to the creditors, which is, according to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, generally
assumed and can only be negated in a limited number of cases:

   - The debtor has made a transaction considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any
consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening
of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the grant of a moratorium (while actions
taken by the debtor between the grant of a moratorium until the confirmation of a composition
agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) can also be
challenged). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was
disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant
transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden
of proof is shifted: the beneficiary must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s length.

   - Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal
bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the grant of a moratorium (while actions taken by the
debtor between the grant of a moratorium until confirmation of a composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) can also be challenged), provided that
the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for existing claims, provided
that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation
(Geldschuld) in any other way than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of
payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is dismissed if the
beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and,
being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time.

   - Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal
bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the grant of a moratorium (while actions taken by the
debtor between the grant of a moratorium until the confirmation of a composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) can also be challenged) performed by
the debtor with the intention to discriminate some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to
others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence, must have been
known to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is
a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted: the
beneficiary must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable.

Following the amendments to the DEBA that came into force on January 1, 2014, with respect to
transactions in favor of related parties, which may include group companies, there is now a legal presumption
that the respective beneficiary was able to recognize the debtor’s intent to cause harm to other creditors. The
introduction of this presumption potentially simplifies avoidance of, and could therefore have a potentially
significant impact on the validity and enforceability of, any guarantee, indemnity, security interest or other
benefit granted in favor of a group company, as well as any other undertaking contained in any agreement having
the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation rights or the
subordination of intra-group claims, or any payment made thereunder.

If any guarantee or security is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the
claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and would have a claim solely under the notes
and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been avoided would
have to be repaid.

Generally, any guarantee or security governed by Swiss law is enforced in accordance with its terms under
Swiss law. Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of art. 111 of the Swiss Code of
Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative.

Other security (rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security agreement.
Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties
to enforce the security either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off of the proceeds against
the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Debt
Collection and Insolvency, in which case the right of objection pursuant to art. 41 of the Swiss Federal Act on
Debt Collection and Insolvency (Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security
agreements.

343


-----

In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire
any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In such a case, in order to determine the price for the acquisition
of the pledged assets, the security agent may prepare a valuation of the pledged assets and based thereupon
enforce the pledge in accordance with the terms of the security agreement and requirements under Swiss law.
Thereafter, the security agent will settle the acquisition of the pledged assets with the pledgor. For this purpose,
the net proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets will, after payment of expenses and taxes, be considered the
price for the enforcement proceeds for the pledged assets, which are to be applied against the secured obligations.
The security agent will credit any remaining surplus to the pledgor.

In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured
parties, collect the assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties
by way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case
without having to initiate proceedings under the DEBA.

After a bankruptcy has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar “accessory”
security rights (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no security created by way of full title transfer such as security
assignments or transfers for security purposes (Sicherungsübereignungen) if having become effective prior to the
opening of bankruptcy over the debtor) are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will
be realized by the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws
which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement
are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will
be used to satisfy unsecured creditors.

Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who
do not hold the secured claim. The beneficial holders of the Additional Notes from time to time will not be party
to the security documents relating to the Collateral. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from
time to time to have a secured claim the security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the
creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim
equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Additional Notes. The pledges governed by Swiss law will
directly secure the parallel debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not been tested in court under Swiss law,
and there is no certainty that it will be recognized and held valid and enforceable under Swiss law.

**_Limitations on Guarantees and Securities Provided by Guarantors Incorporated in Switzerland_**

Any guarantee, indemnity, security interest or other benefit, as well as any other undertaking contained in
any agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation
rights or the subordination of intra-group claims, granted by, or any liability whatsoever of, the Swiss guarantors
or any future guarantor of the Additional Notes incorporated in Switzerland (each, the “Swiss Guarantor”) in
respect of obligations of the Swiss Guarantor’s direct and indirect parent or sister companies (so-called “Up- and
Cross-stream Obligations”) are subject to certain restrictions and risk being held invalid or partially invalid under
Swiss corporate law. Therefore, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and
security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to Up- and Cross-stream Obligations of a Swiss
Guarantor.

Limitations on the enforcement of any guarantee and/or security interest granted by the Swiss Guarantor
apply in relation to Up- and Cross-stream Obligations. The ability of the Swiss Guarantor to assume Up- and
Cross-stream Obligations is restricted under Swiss law insofar as such Up- and Cross-stream Obligations (i) must
be within the corporate purposes and interests of the Swiss Guarantor and (ii) must not result in a repayment of
the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or other non-permitted distribution of assets to
shareholders, board members or other persons close to the Swiss Guarantor. In light of the foregoing, it is
standard market practice to limit the amount of claims under, or proceeds from enforcement that can be applied
to the satisfaction of any claim secured by, any Up- and Cross-stream Obligations assumed by a Swiss Guarantor
to its freely distributable equity at the time of enforcement. Freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum
amount that the Swiss Guarantor can distribute to its shareholders through a dividend payment under Swiss law
at such time, which is currently the total shareholder equity less the total of (i) the aggregate share capital and
(ii) the statutory reserves (to the extent such reserves cannot be transferred into unrestricted, distributable
reserves). Importantly, the payment of dividends from a Swiss Guarantor to its parent will reduce the freely
distributable reserves of a Swiss Guarantor by the respective dividend amount and, in turn, the amount available
to satisfy the obligations under its guarantee and security. In addition, following a decision by the Swiss Federal

344


-----

Supreme Court in October 2014, the freely distributable reserves of a Swiss Guarantor are reduced by the amount
of any up- or cross-stream intercompany loan granted by such Swiss Guarantor to the extent such loan is
determined to have not been granted at market conditions. The performance of Up- and Cross-stream Obligations
may also require adherence to the formalities applicable to distributions to equity holders and, thus, further
corporate action by the Swiss Guarantor and/or audited accounts confirming the amount of freely distributable
equity may be required.

In addition, the enforcement of the Swiss Guarantor’s Up- and Cross-stream Obligations may give rise to
Swiss withholding tax (of up to 35% at current rates, subject to the applicable double-taxation treaties and/or the
discharging of the liability to such tax by notification rather than payment of the tax) to the extent that the
payment or enforcement of such Up- and Cross-stream Obligations have to be regarded as a deemed dividend
distribution. Under Swiss law, the obligation of the Swiss Guarantor to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold
harmless the secured parties for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax may not be valid and, thus, may
prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture or any other Notes
documentation. In addition, the obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the secured parties
for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax in connection with Up- and Cross-stream Obligations granted by the
Swiss Guarantor would in any case be limited by the amount of the freely distributable equity of the Swiss
Guarantor. However, this restriction should not in any way limit any obligations of the Issuer or the other
non-Swiss Guarantors to indemnify the secured parties in respect of the deduction of Swiss withholding tax,
including, without limitation, any tax indemnity undertaking under the Indenture or any other Notes
documentation.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer intends to offer the Additional Notes through the Initial Purchasers. Goldman Sachs
International, KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited are the
Initial Purchasers.

Subject to the terms and conditions contained in the purchase agreement between the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers dated on or around the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial
Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers severally have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal
amount of the Additional Notes. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the purchase agreement,
including their agreement to purchase the Additional Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The
purchase agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of
the Additional Notes if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the
Additional Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase
commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased or that the purchase agreement may be terminated.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery
of the Additional Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they propose to offer the Additional Notes initially at the
offering price listed on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering, the Initial
Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms of the Additional Notes at any time without
notice. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject
orders in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Additional Notes through certain of their
affiliates or through registered broker dealers.

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any sales
of Additional Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates
as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Persons who purchase Additional Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,
taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees for their services in connection
with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses. The Issuer has also agreed to
indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of
those liabilities.

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
purchase agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer or any of the Guarantors that have a tenor
of more than one year (other than the Additional Notes) during the period from the date of the purchase
agreement through the date falling 45 days thereof without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs
International and KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited.

**United States**

Each purchaser of the Additional Notes offered by this Offering Memorandum, in making its purchase, will
be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to
_Investors.”_

The Additional Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold in the United States unless the Additional Notes are registered under the Securities Act, or an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. Accordingly, each of the Initial
Purchasers, severally and not jointly, has agreed that it will not offer or sell the Additional Notes except (i) to
qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and
(ii) to non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) outside the United States in offshore transactions (as defined
in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of 40 days after the commencement of this Offering, an offer or sale of
Additional Notes within the United States by a broker/dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in

346


-----

accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under
the Securities Act. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Additional Notes,
see “Notice to Investors.”

**United Kingdom**

In the purchase agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented and warranted
to us that:

(1) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Additional Notes in, from or otherwise
involving the United Kingdom; and

(2) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and it will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or instrument to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue
or sale of any Additional Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 does not apply to us.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments (being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion
**Order”)), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated**
associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any Additional Notes may
otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to
as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on
or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons. You must not publish, reproduce, distribute or otherwise make available in whole or in part any part of
this Offering Memorandum to any other person. The Additional Notes are not being offered to the public in the
United Kingdom.

**General**

**_Market for Additional Notes_**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Additional Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Additional Notes will be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Additional Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Additional Notes
after completion of this Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may
discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that any market for the Additional Notes will develop, or that it will be liquid if it does develop, or
that you will be able to sell any Additional Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you,
if at all.

**_Price Stabilization and Short Positions_**

In connection with this Offering, the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and
sell Additional Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment, stabilizing transactions,
syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size,
which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the
Additional Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Additional
Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Additional Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to
reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Additional Notes originally sold by such broker/
dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These transactions may be
effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

347


-----

These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Additional Notes. As a
result, the price of the Additional Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open
market. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Additional Notes. In
addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that
these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilization action may begin
on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of this Offering is made and, if begun, may
be discontinued at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days
after the date of the allotment of the Additional Notes. Any stabilization action or over allotment must be
conducted by the Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and
rules.

**_Initial Settlement_**

It is expected that delivery of the Additional Notes will be made against payment therefor on or around the
date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the business day following the
date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule
15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business
days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade
the Additional Notes on the date of pricing or the succeeding business day will be required, by virtue of
the fact that the Additional Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Additional Notes who wish to trade the
Additional Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own adviser.

**_Other Relationships_**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,
which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment
banking, financial advisory, operational support and commercial banking services to the Issuer and its
subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive
customary fees and commissions. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account
and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of the Issuer (including the Additional Notes and the Existing Notes), the Guarantors, or their
respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive allocations of the Additional Notes
(subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the Additional Notes. The Initial
Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may, in the future, act as hedge counterparties to the Issuer and its
subsidiaries consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of
credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Additional Notes.
Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Additional Notes. The Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research
views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and
commissions for these transactions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or certain of their affiliates are holders
of certain indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and will therefore receive a portion of the
proceeds of the Additional Notes in connection with the repayment of each such facility as part of the Offering.

KKR is an affiliate of KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited, which is acting as an Initial Purchaser in
connection with the offering of the Additional Notes. KKR Capital Markets (Ireland) Limited may therefore be
deemed to be our affiliate and have a conflict of interest with us.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, sale, resale, pledge or other transfer of
any of the Additional Notes and/or the Guarantees offered hereby.

The Additional Notes and the Guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless
the Securities are registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and the securities laws of any applicable jurisdiction is available. Accordingly, the Securities are
being offered and sold only (i) to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A, “QIBs”) in reliance on
Rule 144A and (ii) to non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) outside the United States in an offshore
transaction (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S.

We have not registered and will not register the Securities under the Securities Act and, therefore, the
Securities may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Securities to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and
resale only:

   - in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

   - outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S.

We use the terms “U.S. persons,” “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to
them in Regulation S.

acknowledged, represented, warranted and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows (terms used in this
paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A and Regulation S are used herein as defined therein):

(1) it understands and acknowledges that (i) the Securities have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Securities are being offered for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including
sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (ii) the Securities may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
any other applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom and in each case in
compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

(2) it is not an “affiliate” (as defined in rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Issuer or acting on behalf
of the Issuer and it is either (a) a QIB that is aware that any sale of these Securities to it will be made in
reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for
the account of another QIB; or (b) it is a non-U.S. persons and is purchasing the Securities outside the
United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) it acknowledges that neither we nor the Initial Purchasers, nor any person representing us or the Initial
Purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to us or the offer or sale of any Securities,
other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has
been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the
Securities. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as
it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities, including an
opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers. It
acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers
make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum;

(4) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for an account with respect to which it exercises
sole investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment,
and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of
the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its
or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Securities to a QIB pursuant to Rule
144A or to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S;

(5) it understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its acceptance thereof will be

349


-----

deemed to agree, that if in the future it decides to resell, pledge or otherwise transfer any Securities or
any beneficial interests in any Securities, it will do so only (i) in the United States to a person it
reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom
notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, or
(ii) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance
with Regulation S, subject in each of the foregoing cases to compliance with any applicable foreign or
state securities laws and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to our and the
Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer, to require that a certificate of transfer in the
form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the

**Independent Auditor’s Report on the Review of Consolidated Condensed**

**Interim Financial Information**

To the Board of Directors of Selecta Group B.V., Amsterdam

**_Introduction_**

We have been engaged to review the accompanying consolidated condensed balance sheet of Selecta Group
B.V., Amsterdam and its subsidiaries (the Group) as at June 30, 2019 and the related consolidated condensed
statements of profit or loss and comprehensive income for the 3-month and 9-month periods then ended as well
as the changes in consolidated equity and cash flows for the 9-month period then ended, and selected explanatory
notes (the consolidated interim financial information). The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation
and presentation of this consolidated interim financial information in accordance with International Accounting
Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this consolidated
condensed interim financial information based on our review.

**_Scope of Review_**

We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review of
interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope
than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and consequently does not
enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

**_Conclusion_**

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
consolidated condensed interim financial information as at June 30, 2019 is not prepared, in all material respects,
in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

**1. General Information**

Selecta Group B.V. (“the Company”) is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as “the Group”
or “the Selecta Group”. The Group is a pan-European self-service retail and coffee services company.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not represent statutory financial statements of
the Company prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP and the requirements of the Dutch chamber of
commerce and have been prepared voluntarily by the Board of Directors.

**2. Basis of preparation**

These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting (“IAS 34” as issued by the IASB).

The disclosure requirements of IAS 34 are based on the assumption that the reader of the condensed
consolidated financial statements is doing so together with the most recent consolidated financial statements.

The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all information required for a complete set
of IFRS financial statements and should therefore be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial
statements as at 30 September 2018.

Selected explanatory notes have been included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an
understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018.

In 2018 the comparative information has changed as result from restatements and error corrections (see
note 18).

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies**

**3.1. Accounting policies**

Except as described below, the accounting policies adopted in the condensed consolidated financial
statements are consistent with those in the previous financial year as disclosed in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018.

The Group applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“IFRS 15”) and IFRS 9 Financial
_Instruments (“IFRS 9”) for the first time as of 1 October 2018. The impact of the initial application of these_
standards is explained below.

**IFRS 15**

IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is
recognised. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations, and contains
new requirements related to presentation and disclosure. The core principle included in the new standard is that
revenue recognition is no longer based on the transfer of risks and rewards but rather on the transfer of control of
goods and services to a customer.

The Group has applied IFRS 15 as of 1 October 2018 using the cumulative effect method and therefore the
comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 18. The Group only
applied IFRS 15 retrospectively to contracts which had not yet been completed as at 1 October 2018.

IFRS 15 did not have a significant impact on the Group’s accounting policies with respect to all of the
Group’s revenue streams (see Note 6). Because the initial application of IFRS 15 did not result in significant
changes in the amount and the timing of revenue recognition as well as the accounting for contract cost, equity
was not adjusted as of 1 October 2018.

**IFRS 9**

IFRS 9 specifies how financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial
items should be classified and measured. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
_Measurement._

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**_Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities_**

The new standard contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). IFRS 9
eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories of held-to-maturity, available-for-sale and trading. The existing
requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities have largely been retained. As a result
of the new classification requirements the Group reclassified financial assets previously classified as loans and
receivables to financial assets at amortised cost as of 1 October 2018. The change in classification did not have
an impact on the measurement of these financial assets.

**_Impairment of financial assets_**

IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with an ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model. Under the
new guidance, credit losses are recognised earlier than under IAS 39. The new impairment model applies to
financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets in the scope of IFRS 15. The transition to the new
impairment model did not result in a material impact to the financial statements of the Group.

**_Transition_**

Changes in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied as of 1 October
2018. The Group did not adjust equity and comparative information as of 1 October 2018 because the transition
to the new standard did not result in a material impact to the Group’s financial statements.

Various other IFRIC and IFRS requirements are effective from 1 October 2018, which do not have a
material effect on the Group’s financial statements.

**3.2. New and revised/amended standards and interpretations**

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 October 2019 and earlier application is permitted. However, the Group has not early adopted them in preparing
these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

The Group is currently reviewing its financial reporting for the new and amended standards which take
effect on or after 1 October 2019 with a focus on the initial application of IFRS 16 Leases (“IFRS 16”). Under
IFRS 16, which replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations, a lessee
will no longer make a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. All leases will be treated as
finance leases, with the optional exception of short-term leases and low value leases. In the statement of financial
position, the lessee will recognize the asset and the liability for the lease, while in the statement of profit and loss,
the lessee will recognize the interest cost and the depreciation of the leased asset instead of the operating lease
expenses. The Group currently expects that IFRS 16 will lead to an increase in total assets and total liabilities by
approximately €150 million from the effect of recognizing existing operating leases on the balance sheet.
Additionally, annual operating lease expenses of approximately €40 million are expected to be presented as
depreciation expense and interest cost in the future.

**3.3. Statement of seasonality of operations**

Whilst the business of Selecta fluctuates from month to month, the impact between quarters is limited,
except for working capital which is traditionally more negative at year end than during the rest of the year.

Seasonal fluctuations across the months offset each other to a certain degree at group level.

**4. Use of estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**5. Segmental reporting**

The Group’s Board of Directors examines the results achieved by each segment when making decisions on
the allocation of resources and assessment of performance. The Group’s financing activity are managed at Group
level and are not allocated to segments.

Three different regions present similarities in terms of both channel and business model predominances, and
related characteristics. Each of those regions engages business activities as described below, earns revenues and
incurs expenses:

   - **Segment South, UK & Ireland: characterised by paid-vend, predominantly private vending and**
includes Italy, Spain and the UK (including Ireland)

   - **Segment Central: characterised by paid-vend, mixed channel vending and includes Switzerland,**
Germany, Austria and France, with a strong presence and expertise in the public business

   - **Segment North: characterised by free-vend, office coffee services (OCS) and includes Sweden,**
Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands and the Pelican Rouge Roaster in the Netherlands

Revenues, revenues net of vending fees and profit/(loss) before finance costs, net and income taxes,
depreciation and amortisation expense as the operating result of the Group’s reportable segments are regularly
reviewed by the Board of Directors, as the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and
to determine how resources should be allocated.

**6. Revenue by channel**

**On-the-Go:**

The On-the-Go channel includes public and semi-public points of sale (vending machines).

Public points of sale are characterized by their public access, and the fact the customer on these premises
purchase the merchandise (goods such as foods and drinks) ’on the go’, with travel being the main purpose of
their presence at such premises.

Semi-public points of sales are in areas accessible to customers either visiting the premises or employed on
the premises. The main purpose of visitors on the premises shall not be travel (such premises are captured within
public) or work (such premises are captured within workplace), it can be leisure, education, health, access to
public services, etc.

**Workplace:**

The Workplace points of sale are installed in workplace environments and therefore primarily accessible to
the counterparty’s employees.

**Trading:**

The Trading channel captures sales of vending machines and ingredients, rental and technical services and
the sales of products from our own coffee roasting facility. Roaster products include roasted, blended and packed
coffee and related ingredients.

The above channel split articulates the main differences in counterparty and customer segmentation and the
corresponding offering and contract types across the Group.

**7. Vending fee and revenue net of vending fee**

The Group enters into contracts with public and semi-public counterparties to install, operate, supply and
maintain self-service retail machines on freely accessible public and semi-public locations. In return Selecta pays
the counterparties a consideration which is presented as vending fee expense in the consolidated statement of
profit or loss.

Over the last few years the Group reported significant increases in public and semi-public revenues with
customers and associated vending fees which are partially based on the respective revenue generated by the
Group. From the perspective of the Company’s management, the economic substance of these transactions is in
such cases a revenue-sharing business model between Selecta and its counterparties. As such, for internal
operating and management purposes the Group has started to use the measure of revenue net of vending fee in
order to assess the performance of the segments and to draw management decisions accordingly, on a consistent
basis across segments.

Revenue net of vending fees is not a defined performance measure in IFRS. Management presents the
performance measure of revenue net of vending fees because it monitors this performance measure at a
consolidated and segment level and it believes that this measure is relevant to the understanding of the Group’s
financial performance. Due to this, vending fees are separately disclosed below the revenue line and excluded
from the line other operating expenses for both condensed consolidated interim financial statements ending
30 June 2019 and consolidated financial statements ending 30 September 2018.

The provisional goodwill for the year ending 30 September 2018 resulting from the Argenta Group and
Express Vending acquisitions have been restated and their values reach now an amount of € 405 million.

The goodwill relating to Argenta Group is the sum of three components. Selecta’s acquisition of the Argenta
Group, Argenta’s acquisition of a majority stake in Tramezzino and three other local acquisitions performed in
the prior year by the Argenta Group.

In the period 9 months ending 30 June 2019 several minor acquisitions were made, where the measurement
period is still open.

The acquisition accounting adjustments are presented in note 15.

**12. Intangible assets**

Intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and customer contracts.

The trademarks “Selecta” and “Pelican Rouge” recognised by the Group represent the brand names and
have an indefinite useful life. Therefore, these trademarks are tested for impairment annually.

Customer contracts recognised by the Group arise from customer contracts acquired as part of previous
business combinations, including the Pelican Rouge acquisition, and are amortised over their useful life of 15
years. Trademarks and customer contracts recognised in the Argenta acquisition are amortised over their useful
life of 10 years.

**13.3. Details of borrowing facilities**

On 2 February 2018, the Group completed its senior debt refinancing with an aggregate principal amount of
€ 1,300.0 million (euro-equivalent) senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Notes”). The Notes comprise (i)
€ 765.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5[7/8]% senior secured notes, (ii) € 325.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes and (iii) CHF 250.0 million € 225 million in aggregate
principal amount of 5[7/8]% senior secured notes.

As part of the senior debt refinancing, the senior revolving credit facility was upsized to € 150 million from
€ 100 million. The amounts drawn under this facility were € 106.9 million at 30 June 2019 (30 September 2018:
€ 56.3 million). The interest rate on this senior revolving credit facility is based on the relevant rate of the
currency drawn either EURIBOR or LIBOR plus 3.5%. As at 30 June 2019 in € currency 58.5 million was drawn
with an interest rate of 3.5%, and in GBP currency 30 million € 34 million was drawn with an interest rate of
4.1908%.

In addition, one of the Group’s parents, Selecta Group S.a.r.L., had issued a PIK loan for € 220 million in
June 2014, the proceeds of which have been loaned to the Group also in the form of a PIK loan (the “PIK
proceeds loan”). The PIK proceeds loan carries an interest rate of 11.875%. In December 2015, Selecta Group
S.a.r.L. granted an additional PIK loan of € 5.6 million with the same conditions to the Group. From this facility
€ 37.4 m was repaid in cash in February 2018 and the remaining facility was renewed until 2[nd] February 2024.
The interest payable is accrued.

The senior secured notes and the revolving credit facility are secured by first ranking security interests over
all the issued share capital of certain Group companies (together the “Guarantors”), certain intercompany
receivables of the Company and the Guarantors, including assignment of the PIK Proceeds Loan and certain bank
accounts of the Company.

The Group’s share capital consists of 187,002 fully paid ordinary shares (30 September 2018: 187,002) with

On 2 February 2018, two new shares were issued with a nominal value of € 1 per share to Selecta Group
Midco S.a.r.L., the shareholder of Selecta Group B.V. The new shares were issued at an issue price of in total
€ 200.4 million. The amount above the nominal value of the shares increased the share premium of Selecta
Group B.V. The shareholder and the Company had previously entered into a PIK loan agreement, as a result of
which this shareholder had a receivable on the Company in the value of € 200.4 million. The obligation of the
Shareholder to pay the issue price of the new shares, was agreed to be settled by means of a set off against the
receivable.

Factoring liabilities have reduced since 30 September 2018 as the Group replaced its legacy trade
receivables factoring with recourse program by a trade receivables factoring program with no recourse to the
Company. This new non-recourse program allowed the Group to de-recognize trade receivables in the amount of
€ 48.2 million (€ 39.0 million at 30 September 2018) and improve its net working capital as well as cash flow
from operating activities.

**16.2. Measurement of fair values**

The following table shows the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 fair values:

**Financial instruments measured at fair value**


**Valuation technique**

Cross currency swaps Periodic mid-market values are based on
observable inputs including foreign
currency exchange rates and interest
rates. A credit spread is added to the
standard, risk-free discount curve,
determined by comparing the composite
yield of a basket of fixed-rate bonds
issued by entities with similar credit
characteristics to the Company, to the
risk-free rate.

**Financial instruments not measured at fair value**

**Valuation technique**

Debt securities Discounted cash flows: The fair value is
estimated considering a net present value
calculated using discount rates derived
from quoted yields of securities with
similar maturity and credit rating that are
traded in active markets, adjusted by an
illiquidity factor.

**16.3. Derivative financial instruments**

On 2 February 2018, the Group entered into new cross currency swaps in the value of € 404 million with a
maturity date of 1 October 2021 and conditions set out below. No hedge accounting is applied to these cross
currency swaps. The net fair value of the swaps at 30 June 2019 was recognized at a value of € 11.2 million
(30 September 2018: € 8.5 million), resulting in a gain of € 2.6 million in the period ended 30 June 2019.

**17. Commitments for expenditures**

**Operating lease commitments**

The Group leases land, operating buildings like warehouses, offices and vehicles under operating lease
agreements. The lease expenditure charged to the statement of profit or loss for the 9 months ended
30 June 2019 is € 147.7 million, thereof minimum lease payments € 72.2 million (for the 9 months ended 30 June
2018: € 119.6 million and € 59.5 million, respectively).

The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

Within one year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35,764 26,200

**Total operating lease commitments** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **153,554** **117,493**

€ 34.6 million (2018: € 35.6 million) of the total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable
operating leases relate to building lease contracts held by the holding and trading company Selecta AG in
Switzerland. The most significant lease contracts have been signed for a period between 15 and 20 years.

**18. Restated prior year interim financial statement**

During the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, adjustments were
made to the comparative financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2018.

In the condensed cash flow statement Argenta’s repayment of the loan of € 201,254k was re-classified from
investing activities to financing activities. The amounts presented in the restated cash flow statement of
€ 1.3 billion proceeds and € -1.1 billion repayment are gross values, whereas the net value is € 163 million.

In certain cases, some of the Group’s intercompany loans qualify as a net investment in a foreign operation
requiring any foreign currency gains and losses to be recognized in the other comprehensive income (previously
recorded in the P&L). Accordingly, a foreign currency loss of € 0.7 million has been recorded in equity (instead
of P&L), and € 0.7 million currency gain for valuation of derivative financial instrument. Furthermore, a
€ 0.2 million increase of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax expenses has been recorded.

The depreciation for 9 month ended 30 June 2019 increased by 3.3 million due to change in the phasing.

Additionally, the accounting of acquisitions within one year since date of acquisition has been revised in
accordance with IFRS 3 as disclosed in Note 15.

**19. Share based payments**

In April 2018, the Group implemented a long-term incentive plan for key senior management called
«Management incentive plan» (MIP). The MIP offers the opportunity to invest indirectly, through a partnership,
in certain instruments of one of Selecta Group B.V.’s parents (HoldCo) which is not in the scope of these
consolidated financial statements, at nominal value. The MIP is a group share-based payment plan under IFRS 2.
Due to the fact that the plan does not result in an obligation for the Group to settle the plan, it is classified as an
equity-settled plan.

Entitled managers entered into the plan in April 2018 and the following months by signing a deed of
adherence. The individual deed signing date represents the grant date. Managers subscribed to almost 100% of
the total plan volume by 30 June 2019.

The following investments were made by 31 March 2019:

   - Class A interests which provide an indirect economic interest in 597,238,605 preferred equity
certificates (PECs) of HoldCo with a total nominal value of € 5,972,386.

   - Class B interests which provide an indirect economic interest in 28,455 ordinary shares with a nominal
value of € 285 representing 0.86% of the HoldCo’s share capital and

   - Class C interests which provide an indirect economic interest in 223,193 additional shares with a
nominal value of € 2,232 representing 6.70% of the HoldCo’s share capital

The PECs underlying class A interests are interest-bearing, have a mandatory retirement date and do not
entitle to voting rights in Holdco. They are generally not convertible to equity. As a result, they do not qualify as
a share based payment under IFRS 2.

Holders of class B and C interests are entitled to distributions based on the underlying shares including
distributions in case of a sale or an initial public offering (IPO), an exit event, of the Group.

The MIP provides the following vesting rules in regards to class C interests:

   - Graded vesting over a period of four years with 20% vesting at the grant date and 20% at each
anniversary over a period of four years

   - Accelerated vesting in case of an exit event

The class B interests vested immediately at grant date.

In case of a termination of employment before an exit event, a manager would become a good or a bad
leaver depending on the circumstances of termination. A good leaver’s vested class C interests would be
reimbursed at fair value whereas unvested class C interests would be reimbursed at cost. If a manager became a
bad leaver all class C interests would be reimbursed at cost.

The MIP had no significant impact on the Group’s financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2019
and the comparative period.

**20. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets**

The Group, through a number of its subsidiaries, is involved in various legal proceedings or claims arising
from its normal business. Provisions are made as appropriate where management assesses that it is probable that
an outflow of economic benefits will arise. None of these proceedings results in a material contingent liability for
the Group.

**21. Events after the balance sheet date**

No events have occurred between 30 June 2019 and the date of authorisation of the issue of these condensed
consolidated interim financial statements by the Board of Directors of the Company on 22 August 2019 that
could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Group is currently reviewing its financial reporting for the new and amended standards which take
effect on or after 1 October 2018 and which the Group did not voluntarily adopt early.

On 1 January 2018, IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” came into effect. The Group will
implement the new standard in its financial statements 2018/2019 and will apply the cumulative effect method
for the transition. The new standard establishes a model to use in accounting for revenue and contains a new set
of principles on when and how to recognize and measure revenue as well as new requirements related to
presentation and disclosure. The core principle included in the standard is that revenue recognition is no longer
based on the transfer of risks and rewards but rather on the transfer of control of goods and services to a
customer.

The Group is currently performing detailed analysis regarding the impact of IFRS 15 on the recognition of
revenue streams in its different business lines, the effect of implementation of IFRS 16 on the Group financial
statements and the impact of IFRS 9 requirements.

**3.3. Basis of consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), cf. note 39. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting
policies into line with those used by other members of the Group and the IFRS.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

In all the following disclosure sections, Argenta’s consolidated balance sheet is integrated as part of the
balance sheet positions disclosed, whereas Argenta’s consolidated statement of profit and loss is included from
2 February 2018 (note 32).

Regarding the acquisition of Express Vending, its consolidated balance sheet is integrated as part of the
balance sheet positions disclosed, whereas Express Vending’s consolidated statement of profit and loss is
included from August 2018 (note 32).

During the year ended 30 September 2018, Selecta Group sold its participations in Selecta Finland and
Custompack.

**3.4. Business combinations**

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business
combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets acquired, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of
the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion
of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

**3.5. Foreign currencies**

**Foreign currencies in individual financial statements**

The functional currency of each group company is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial
position of each entity are translated in Euros (“EUR” or “€”), which is the presentation currency for the
consolidated financial statements. Euro is the currency that management uses when controlling and monitoring
the performance and financial position of the Group.

Transactions in currencies other than the group company’s functional currency (foreign currency
transactions) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date on which the transactions were entered
into, or a close approximation thereof. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are maintained at
the historical exchange rates and are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

**Foreign currencies in consolidated financial statements**

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s
foreign operations are expressed in Euros using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and
expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as other comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s
currency translation reserve. Such exchange differences are reclassified from equity to statement of profit or loss
in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.

The foreign currency rates applied against the Euro were as follows:

**30 September 2018** **30 September 2017**
**Balance** **Statement of** **Balance** **Statement of**

**3.6. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Maintenance and repair
costs are expensed as incurred.

The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Infinite (no depreciation is applied)
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 to 60 years

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that is different from that
of the asset to which it belongs is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values and
depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a
prospective basis.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same
basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss.

**3.7. Goodwill and intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
subsidiary recognised at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. These cash-generating units are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication
that a unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the amount attributable to goodwill is included in the determination of the profit
or loss on disposal.

**Other intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill
where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their value can be measured reliably.

**Trademark**

The trademarks recognised by the Group have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. The
trademarks are allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to the cash-generating units that are tested for
impairment annually as described in the section on goodwill above.

**Customer contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life. The Selecta and Pelican Rouge customer contracts are amortised over the
useful life of 15 years. The Argenta customer contracts are amortised over a useful life of 10 years.

**Software**

Software licences are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that they will generate future
economic benefits. They are amortised using the straight-line method over three-five years.

F-39

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets and are amortised by the straight-line method
over three to five years when the following criteria are met:

   - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

   - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

   - there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

   - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

   - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and

   - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures
that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Other software licences and software development costs are expensed as incurred. No intangible asset
arising from research (or from research phase of an internal project) is recognised. Expenditure on research (or
on the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.

**3.8. Impairment of non-current assets other than goodwill or trademark**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its tangible and
intangible assets other than goodwill or trademark may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can
be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can
be identified.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the
asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the
statement of profit or loss.

**3.9. Prepayments and accrued income**

Prepayments and accrued income comprise payments made in advance relating to the following year, and
income relating to the current year, which will not be received until after the balance sheet date. Prepayments are
measured at the nominal amount of the payments. Accrued income is measured at amortised costs.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**3.10. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value corresponds to
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less point-of-sales costs. A valuation allowance on
inventories is recorded, when the cost of inventories is greater than their net realisable value.

**3.11. Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers**

Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers include agreed discounts from suppliers’ list prices,
value and volume-related rebates. Income from value and volume-related rebates is recognised based on actual
purchases in the period as a proportion of total purchases made or forecast to be made over the rebate period.
Agreed discounts relating to inventories are credited to the statement of profit or loss as the goods are sold.
Rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the balance sheet date are deducted from their carrying
values so that the costs of inventories are recorded net of applicable rebates. Rebates received in respect of
property, plant and equipment are deducted from the costs capitalised.

**3.12. Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. An impairment loss on trade
receivables is recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference
between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s
original effective interest rate.

**3.13. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash
at bank and the change floats in vending machines’ cash change boxes.

Due to the Group’s business model, significant cash balances are held at year-end in cash collection boxes
inside vending machines (trapped cash) and on behalf of the Group by external cash collecting firms, or en route
to or from such cash counting firms. These amounts are included in other current assets.

Bank overdrafts are included within current liabilities on the balance sheet.

**3.14. Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability.

When some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be recovered from a third
party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that recovery will be received and the
amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

**3.15. Loans due to parent undertaking / borrowings**

Loans due to parent undertaking or borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**3.16. Derivative financial instruments**

The Group uses from time to time derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and/or foreign exchange risk.

Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date, with changes therein generally recognised
in profit or loss (finance income or finance costs).

Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument and the economic
hedge created by the derivative financial statement is deemed to be effective, the changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The amount accumulated in
equity is retained in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods
during which the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.

In order to prove the effectiveness of the hedge the instrument is extensively documented at inception and
regularly tested to ensure that it remains effective. Where the hedge, or a portion of the hedge, is deemed not to
be effective, the change in fair value is recorded directly in finance income or finance costs in the statement of
profit or loss.

**3.17. Accruals and deferred income**

Accruals and deferred income comprise expenses relating to the current year, which will not be paid until
after the balance sheet date and cash received in advance, relating to the following year. Deferred income is
measured at the nominal value of the payments received less, if appropriate, cumulative amortisation in
accordance with IAS 18. Accruals are measured at amortised cost.

**3.18. Taxation**

The credit or charge for current income tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which
are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates of the countries where the Group has operations.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary
differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the
corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.

Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred
income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it can be reasonably expected that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities, which affects neither taxable nor accounting income.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Current income tax and deferred income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case it is
also recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists
to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**3.19. Employee benefits**

The Group maintains various defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.

Defined benefit obligations are largely covered through pension plan assets of pension funds that are legally
separated and independent from the Group. These are managed by a board of trustees consisting of
representatives of the employees and the employer. The organisation, management and financing of the pension
plans comply with the applicable pension regulations. Employees and pensioners or their survivors receive
statutorily determined benefits upon leaving the company or retiring as well as in the event of death or disability.
These benefits are financed through employer and employee contributions.

**Defined benefit plans**

In the case of defined benefits pension plans, the pension expenses and obligations are valued according to
the projected unit credit method. The corresponding calculations are carried out yearly by independent qualified
actuaries.

Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.

All re-measurement gains and losses on the net defined benefit liability are charged or credited in other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting past service cost is
generally recognised in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The Group recognises
gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

**Defined contribution plans**

In the case of defined contribution pension plans, the Group has no further payment obligations once the
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an expense when the employees render the
corresponding service to the Group, which normally occurs in the same year in which the contributions are paid.
Payments made to state-managed plans are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the
Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution pension plan.

**3.20. Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, excluding trade discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.

**Sale of goods**

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered to the client site or when goods
are purchased from a machine by a customer, depending on the contract terms.

Revenue may be received directly in the form of cash from the consumer, or may be invoiced to a client
periodically.

Where revenue is received in the form of cash, the amount recognised is the amount of cash received until
the last date on which the cash was collected from the machine, plus an estimate of the sales between this date
and the period end calculated based on historical trends.

Where the sale of goods is invoiced to the client, the amount recognised is based either on the amounts
delivered to the client or based on the consumption in the machines, depending on the specific contractual terms.
Where revenue is recognised based on consumption in the machines, the amount recognised is based on the last
recorded consumption from the machine plus an estimate of the sales between this date and the period end
calculated based on historical trends.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Rendering of services**

Selecta also provides services to clients in the form of machine rentals, technical services and hygiene
services. Where the income is a fixed amount for the period the amount of revenue recognised is based on this
fixed amount. Where the income is dependent on the work performed, the revenue is recognised based on records
of technical site visits or other services provided.

**Interest income**

Income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest rate that is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of
the financial asset.

**Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

**3.21. Leases**

The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment where the
Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are
capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between repayment of the outstanding
liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in
non-current liabilities or current liabilities as appropriate. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to
the statement of profit or loss over the lease period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance
leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Other lease agreements are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**3.22. Purchasing income**

The Group receives certain rebates from its suppliers in respect of the purchase of vending machines and
consumables. Where the rebates are received in respect of vending machines which are capitalised within
property, plant and equipment, the cost of those vending machines is reduced by the amount of the rebate
received. In relation to vending machines and consumables sold to customers and recognised within revenue, the
cost of goods sold and the cost of inventories are reduced by the amount of the rebate received.

**3.23. Finance costs**

Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and finance leases calculated using the effective
interest method, fair value losses on derivatives classified as held for trading and foreign exchange losses.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance income or finance expense
depending on whether the total foreign currency movements represent a gain or a loss accordingly. Net interest
expense on the net defined benefit obligation is included in the finance costs.

**4. Use of estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of
assets and liabilities in the next financial year are discussed below.

**4. Use of estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties (Continued)**

**Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives**

The carrying amounts of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated and which include
other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an
indication that they may be impaired. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on
their values in use. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with the most
up-to-date business plans that have been formally approved by management. The amounts and key assumptions
used for the value in use calculations are set out in notes 16 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Customer Contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life. The Selecta and Pelican Rouge customer contracts are amortised over the
useful life of 15 years. The Argenta customer contracts are amortised over a useful life of 10 years.

The Group actively monitors retention rates on customer contracts and considers other relevant factors
which may provide an indication of impairment. The amounts are described in note 17 to the consolidated
financial statements.

**Sales estimations**

Where sales are based on consumption in the machines, there may be a timing difference between the date
on which the cash was last collected from the machines or the date on which the sales readings were taken. In
this case an estimate of the sales between the date of the last cash collection or the last machine reading and the
end of the period is made. The estimate is based on historical sales trends in respect of the specific client sites
and machines. The estimated amount of sales which have been neither collected in cash nor invoiced to
customers are recorded as Accrued income and uncollected cash in points-of-sale, as disclosed in note 21.

**Inventories**

Inventories include perishable products which requires the Group to make estimates regarding the amount of
goods whose shelf life will expire before they are sold in order to determine the appropriate level of allowances
to be recorded. Such allowances are therefore calculated with reference to the level of inventories held, average
sales, and expiry dates.

Allowances for spare parts held in inventory are calculated according to the inventory turnover ratio.

**5. Segmental reporting**

In the financial year starting 1 October 2017, the Group Selecta consolidates the entities of the Pelican
Rouge Group acquired on 7 September 2017 and the Argenta Group acquired on 2 February 2018. The
acquisition of both Groups has led the Selecta Group to grow nearly twofold, triggering the need to revise its
previous segmental reporting.

The Group’s Board of Directors examine the results achieved by each segment when making decisions on
the allocation of resources and assessment of performance. The Group’s financial activities are managed at
Group level and are not allocated to segments.

Three different regions present similarities in terms of both channel and business model predominances, and
related characteristics. Each of those regions engages business activities as described below, earn revenues and
incur expenses:

   - Segment South, UK & Ireland: characterised by paid-vend, predominantly private vending and includes
Italy, Spain and the UK (including Ireland)

   - Segment Central: characterised by paid-vend, mixed channel vending and includes Switzerland, Germany,
Austria and France, with a strong presence and expertise in the public business.

The profit/(loss) before finance results net and income taxes, depreciation and amortisation expense as the
operating result of the Group’s reportable segments are regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors, as the
Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and to determine how resources should be
allocated.

Revenue by channel:

**_On the Go:_**

The On the Go channel includes public and semi-public points of sale.

Public points of sale are characterized by their public access, and the fact the end-consumers on these
premises purchase the merchandise ’on the go’, with travel being the main purpose of their presence at such
premises.

Semi-public points of sales are in areas accessible to end-consumers either visiting the premises or
employed on the premises. The main purpose of visitors on the premises shall not be travel (such premises are
captured within public) or work (such premises are captured within workplace): it can be leisure, education,
health, access to public services, etc.

**_Workplace:_**

The Workplace points of sale are installed in workplace environments and therefore primarily accessible to
customer’s employees.

**6. Revenue (Continued)**

**_Trading:_**

The Trading channel captures trade machines sales and ingredients sales; rental and technical services; and
the external sales of the Roaster products.

The above channel split articulates the main differences in customer segmentation and the corresponding
offering and contract types across the Group.

**7. Vending fee and revenue net of vending fee**

The Group enters into contracts with public and semi-public vending clients to install, operate, supply and
maintain vending machines on freely accessible public and semi-public locations. In return Selecta pays the
client a consideration which is presented as a vending fee expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

Over the last few years the Group reported significant increases in public and semi-public revenues and
associated vending fees which are based on the respective revenue generated by the Group. From the perspective
of the Company’s management, the economic substance of these transactions is a revenue-sharing business
model between Selecta and its vending clients. As such, for internal operating and management purposes the
Group has started to use the measure of revenue net of vending fee in order to assess the performance of the
segments and to draw management decisions accordingly, on a consistent basis across segments.

Revenue net of vending fee is not a defined performance measure in IFRS. Management presents the
performance measure of revenue net of vending fee because it monitors this performance measure at a
consolidated level and it believes that this measure is relevant to the understanding of the Group’s financial
performance. Due to this vending fee is separately disclosed below the revenue line and excluded from the line
other operating expenses for both years ending 30 September 2017 and 2018.

rates and pre-tax profits and losses in each country, and is not the same as the medium to long term effective tax
rate of the Group.

The provisional goodwill resulting from the Argenta Group and Express Vending acquisitions amounts to
€ 423 million.

This value is subject to adjustments linked with further purchase price allocation assessments falling due
within one year of the acquisitions. The values disclosed are therefore preliminary, and further information on the
corresponding business combinations are presented in the note 32.

The provisional goodwill relating to Argenta is the addition of three components: the Selecta Group
acquisition of the Argenta Group (€352.4 million); Argenta’s acquisition of a majority stake in Tramezzino
(€2.7 million) and three other local acquisitions performed in the current year by the Argenta Group
(€7.2 million).

The goodwill reduction in the current year results from the sale of Selecta Finland, and in the prior year
from the sale of Baltic subsidiaries. Further information on the disposals is presented in note 33.

**16.1. Impairment testing**

During the financial year the carrying values including goodwill of the cash-generating units have been
compared to their recoverable amount.

The test was conducted on the basis of the carrying values and the recoverable amounts of the Selecta
Group’s cash generating units, excluding Express Vending.

The goodwill tested as of 30 September 2018 was of € 1,019 million, composed of the legacy Selecta,
Pelican Rouge and Argenta acquisitions goodwills. Express Vending was excluded from the testing process,
given the recent date and the materiality of the acquisition.

It has been concluded that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amounts and therefore no
impairment is required to be recorded.

**16.2. Allocation to cash-generating units**

**Cash-generating units considered in this financial year’s impairment test**

Until 30 September 2017 the Group had been operating through four segments which were the Group’s cash
generating units (CGU) for the purposes of impairment testing: France, North, Central and West.

**16. Goodwill (Continued)**

In the financial year starting 1 October 2017, the Selecta Group consolidates the entities of the Pelican
Rouge Group acquired on 7 September 2017 and of the Argenta Group acquired on 2 February 2018. The
acquisition of both Groups has led the Selecta Group to grow nearly twofold, triggering the need to revise its
previous segmental reporting.

In alignment with Group’s segmental reporting, the three CGUs considered for the purposes of impairment
testing are as follows:

   - Segment South, UK & Ireland which includes Italy, Spain and the UK (including Ireland)

   - Segment Central which includes Switzerland, Germany, Austria and France

   - Segment North which includes Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands and the
Pelican Rouge Roaster in the Netherlands

The amount of goodwill allocated to each cash generating unit at 30 September 2018 and 2017 were as

**16.3. Summary of assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing**

In undertaking the impairment test of the Selecta goodwill, the Group has used post-tax cash flow
projections for the computation of value in use based on the 2019 – 2021 business plan of the Group, covering a
three-year period. In years four to seven the Group assumes further growth of 3.0% (2017: 3.0%).

Cash flows beyond the seven-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates as disclosed in the
table below. In 2018, the growth rates were as follows:

**2018**

**17. Intangible assets (Continued)**

In 2017, reclassifications to assets held for sale related to Selecta Finland, which had to be disposed within
6 months upon the completion of the Pelican Rouge acquisition, and was disposed effectively in the financial
year ended 30 September 2018.

The trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as based on an analysis of all of the relevant
factors, there are no foreseeable limits to the period over which the assets are expected to generate net cash
inflows for the Group.

The Pelican Rouge trademark is valued as a coffee brand. The Pelican Rouge coffee brand was founded in
Antwerp in 1863 and enjoys brand recognition in legacy Pelican Rouge markets.

The trademarks have been allocated to the Group’s cash generating units which are tested for impairment
annually. The trademarks tested were the Selecta and Pelican Rouge trademarks. The acquisition of Argenta and
Express Vending did not result in the allocation of value to the Argenta and Express Vending trademarks as part
of the preliminary purchase price allocation.

At 30 September 2018 and 2017, the trademark has been allocated as follows, and restated for 2017
following the change in segmental reporting:

**Customer contracts**

Selecta customer contracts acquired in the business combination in 2007 and Pelican Rouge customer
contracts acquired in the business combination in 2017 have a finite useful life and are amortised over 15 years.

The Argenta customer contracts acquired in the current year have been allocated a preliminary value of
€ 78 million. Given Argenta’s size and certain features of its client portfolio compared to Selecta and Pelican
Rouge, a 10 year finite useful life has been deemed appropriate.

The remainder of the balance (€ 4 million) relates to three acquisitions conducted by Argenta on its local
market, as presented in note 32.

the end of the credit period, thereafter the charging of interest is at the discretion of local management depending
on the amounts and customers involved. Where interest is charged in respect of an overdue receivable the interest
rate applied is between 3% and 15% per annum depending on the country and the customer contract.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**20. Trade receivables (Continued)**

The Group has provided for all receivables over 360 days because historical experience indicates that
receivables that are past due beyond 360 days are not recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and
360 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by
reference to past default experience.

Depending on the size of a potential new customer and the volume of trading expected, prior to accepting
new credit customers, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and
defines a suitable credit limit for the customer.

**20.1. Analysis of receivables past due but not impaired**

The Group’s trade receivable balance includes debtors with a carrying amount of € 8.3 million (2017:
€ 7.2 million) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for as there has not
been any significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality
of the trade receivable at the reporting date. This is in most cases evidenced by the age of the receivable, and the
Group has implemented specific policies regarding the level of provision required for the change in credit quality
based on the ageing of the receivable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the fact that the Group has a very large customer base and a
mix of credit and cash sales. Accordingly, management believes that there is no further credit provision required
in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

**23.3. Details of borrowing facilities**

The Group completed on 2 February 2018 its senior debt refinancing with an aggregate principal amount of
€1,300.0 million (euro-equivalent) senior secured notes due 2024 (the “Notes”). The Notes comprise
(i) €765.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5 [7]⁄8% senior secured notes, (ii) €325.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes and (iii) CHF 250.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of 5 [7]⁄8% senior secured notes.

The proceeds of the Notes were used to (i) fund the redemption of all of (a) the €350.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of the Group’s 6.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 and (b) the CHF 245.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of the Group’s 6.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2020; (ii) repay all amounts
outstanding under the existing €374.8 million senior term loan of the Group; (iii) repay all amounts outstanding
under the existing revolving credit facility of the Group; (iv) in connection with the acquisition of Gruppo
Argenta S.p.A. by a subsidiary of the Group, refinance certain of Argenta’s existing third-party indebtedness and
shareholder loans; (v) repay certain shareholder loans of the Group, the proceeds of which will ultimately be used
to repay certain interests owed to a minority investor who will exit in connection with such repayment; (vi) fund
excess cash on balance sheet for general corporate purposes; and (vii) pay estimated fees and expenses in
connection with the issuance of the Notes.

As part of the senior debt refinancing, the senior revolving credit facility was upsized to € 150 million as of
2 February 2018 from € 100 million. The amounts drawn under this facility were € 56.3 million at 30 September
2018 (30 September 2017: € 0 million). The interest rate on this senior revolving credit facility has remained
based on the relevant rate of the currency drawn LIBOR plus 3.5%.

In addition the Group’s parent undertaking, Selecta Group S.a.r.L. had issued in June 2014 a PIK loan for
€ 220 million, the proceeds of which have been loaned to the Group also in the form of a PIK loan (the “PIK
proceeds loan”). The PIK proceeds loan carries an interest rate of 11.875%. In December 2015 Selecta Group
S.a.r.L. granted an additional PIK loan with the same conditions to the Group of € 5.6 million. From this facility
€ 37.4 m was repaid in cash in February 2018 and the remaining facility was renewed until 2024. The interest
payable is accrued and capitalized biannually.

The senior secured notes and the revolving credit facility are secured by first ranking security interests over
all the issued share capital of certain Group companies (together the “Guarantors”), certain intercompany
receivables of the Company and the Guarantors, including assignment of the PIK Proceeds Loan and certain bank
accounts of the Company.

Under the terms of the Group’s super senior revolving credit facility, certain ratios to be tested if drawings
exceeds 40% of the RCF facility.

The Group has complied with its covenant obligations in the current and the previous year.

**25. Post-employment benefits**

**25.1. Defined contribution plans**

The Group operates defined contribution plans for qualifying employees in a number of its countries of
operation. The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group under the control of unrelated
parties.

**25.2. Defined benefit plans**

**Description of plans**

The Group offers defined benefit plans in Switzerland, Germany, UK, Belgium, Spain and Italy as well as
retirement indemnity plans in France.

The two main significant plans are in Switzerland and UK, which represent an net asset position of
€ 59.9 million, the remainder of the countries recorded a net liability position of € 17.8 million.

Switzerland

The pension scheme is part of the Valora Pension Fund, domiciled in Muttenz, Switzerland and is governed
by the rules of the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans
(BVG), which specifies the minimum benefits that are to be provided by pension plans. The scheme covers
multiple employers, including Selecta, with the scheme assets allocated between Selecta and the other companies
in the scheme in proportion to the mathematical reserve and savings capital as at 30 September 2018. One
employee of Selecta AG in Switzerland is at the foundation board of the Valora Pension Fund to ensure
representation of Selecta in the wider scheme.

The designated purpose of the scheme is to protect the employees, including the employees’ dependents and
survivors, of the Valora Group of companies of Switzerland and the companies with which the scheme has
concluded an affiliation agreement against the economic consequences of old age, death and disability.

The benefits are defined in the pension plan regulations that are far above the minimum requirements
stipulated by the BVG. Retirement benefits are based on the accumulated retirement savings capital and can
either be drawn as a life-long pension or as a lump sum payment. The pension is calculated upon retirement by
multiplying the balance of the retirement savings capital with the applicable conversion rate. The retirement
savings capital results from the yearly savings contributions by both employer and employee until retirement and
carries interest thereon. The savings contributions are defined in the pension plan regulations. Minimum
contributions and minimum interest are defined by the BVG and the Federal Council respectively.

The scheme provides for a basic and supplementary plan. Under the basic plan, the wage portions above the
entry level for admission (equal to three quarters of the maximum retirement pension benefit prescribed by law)
are pensionable. The supplementary plan additionally offers coverage of wage portions that exceed the 5-fold
value of the maximum retirement pension benefit by more than CHF 5,000.

The scheme is subdivided into a risk pre-insurance and a primary insurance. The risk pre-insurance
coverage is a pure risk insurance that covers the risks of death and disability up to the age of 25. The primary
insurance begins at age 25 and is comprised of a savings facility run by the scheme and insurance covering the
death and disability risks.

The scheme participates in compulsory coverage and is entered in the register for occupational pension
providers as provided for by art. 48 of the Federal Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension
Plans Act (BVG/LPP). At minimum it provides for the benefits pursuant to BVG/LPP. The scheme is under the
regulatory supervision of the Canton of Basel Land.

UK

The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is identified as the
Selecta (UK) Pension Plan (the “Plan”, formerly known as the Autobar Group Retirement Benefits Plan). The
scheme is managed by an independent trustee (ITS) and the ultimate authority is with the UK Pension Regulator

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**25. Post-employment benefits (Continued)**

in case of disputes between the trustee and the Group. The Group accounted for this plan as defined benefit plan
because it is exposed to risks as mentioned in the paragraph ‘sensitivity analysis’.

With effect from October 2004 the Plan was closed to new members and on 31 March 2015 future accrual
stopped. Prior to that, pension accrual for active members was a proportion of the salary at retirement (or earlier
date of leaving) based on length of Plan membership. Pensions are payable for life from retirement with the
option to convert some pension to a cash lump sum at the point of retirement. A reduced pension is payable to
any surviving spouse on death of the member. Pensions in payment increase each year at various rates depending
on the period when accrued. Pensions for those members not yet retired are increased in line with the Consumer
Prices Index subject to a cap of 5% a year (applied over the whole period).

**Amounts included in the consolidated financial statements**

The amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in respect of defined benefit plans are
as follows:

**2018** **2017**
**€ (000’s)** **€ (000’s)**

Current employer service cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (4,739) (4,550)

**Defined benefit income/(cost) recognised in statement of profit or loss . . . . . . .** **9,999** **(2,507)**

In September 2018, following a review of the UK-Plan’s governing legal documents, some changes to how
future pension increases are determined, have been agreed by the Plan’s Trustee and the Group. This amendment
of future increases to these benefits has resulted in a decrease in the Plan’s liabilities of €12.1 million as at
30 September 2018 and has been recognised as a negative past service cost in the year ended 30 September 2018.

Past service credit / (cost) and gains / (losses) relates to a Swiss plan amendment of the benefits payable
under the Group’s pension in scheme in Switzerland. In March 2018 the Valora pension scheme reduced the
conversion rate for calculating the retirement pension, resulting in a reduction of the future pensions to be paid
and hence the defined benefit obligation of the scheme. This has resulted in a decrease in the Plan’s liabilities of
€2 million as at 30 September 2018 and has been recognised as a negative past service cost in the year ended
30 September 2018. As communicated in March 2018 by the pension fund Valora, conversion rates will decrease
to 6.2% to 6.0% (for men aged 65 and women aged 64), effective on 1 January 2019.

As regards to prior year credit as communicated in June 2017 by the pension fund Valora, conversion rates
decreased to 6.2% for men and 6.4% for women, effective on 1 January 2018, resulting in a reduction of the
future pensions to be paid and hence the defined benefit obligation of the scheme.

obligation is as follows:

As at 30 September 2017, the net defined benefit assets did not exceed the limit of the sum of the economic
benefits from reductions to future contributions and the employer contribution reserve. At 30 September 2018,
the net defined benefit assets exceed this limit, and an asset ceiling of € 19.5 million was recognized.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The valuation of the pension benefit obligations is particularly sensitive with regard to changes to the
discount rate and the assumptions of pension rises and the expected mortality rate. The following table shows the
change of defined benefit obligation on the basis of a reasonably possible change to these actuarial assumptions
at 30 September 2018 and 2017:

Every sensitivity analysis considers the change of one assumption, while all other assumptions remain the
same. This approach shows the isolating effect if an individual assumption is changed, but does not consider that

The provisions in respect of litigations and tax represent management’s best estimate of the future outflow
of economic benefits required to settle legal claims and tax claims made against the Group, and has been based
on advice from and discussion with the Group’s lawyers.

The restructuring provision represents amounts due to be paid in respect of certain restructuring activities
which have been initiated. The amounts provided include the costs of employee severance payments, as well as
other costs associated with closing facilities or offices.

The ‘Other’ provision includes a deferred consideration of € 27 million as well as a significant portion of
long service awards (jubilee benefits) to which all employees of Selecta Switzerland are entitled based on their
years of service. The calculation requires an actuarial valuation to be performed as it is based on assumptions of
expected service lengths, current service length, date of entry, monthly salary, sex, and long service awards paid
in last financial year.

**27.4. Unrecognised deferred tax assets/liabilities**

These deferred income tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that future taxable profits
will be available to utilise the losses.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would
be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such amounts are currently regarded as
permanently reinvested. The parent is not only able to control the distribution of dividends but has also no plan
for any such distribution.

Selecta Group subsidiaries in Switzerland, UK, Benelux, Switzerland and Sweden have entered into a
non-recourse receivable factoring program with ABNAMRO Commercial Finance BV. In Norway and Finland
the factor is Ikano Bank AB, in France the factor is FactoFrance S.A.S. and in Spain the factor is Bankia S.A. In
accordance with this agreement, the relevant Selecta’s subsidiaries may assign eligible receivables to the Factor
at an agreed market rate in order to receive funding at any given time. The agreement is subject to terms and
conditions customary for such transactions. The Group’s non-recourse facilities are not capitalised and amount to
a total € 39 million at 30 September 2018.

**29. Equity**

**30. Financial risk management**

**30.1. Risk management framework**

Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Management Board of
the Group has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s financial policies.
Group’s management reports on a monthly basis to the Supervisory Board on the Group’s performance. The
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for setting financial strategies, which are executed by Group
Treasury and by the Group’s subsidiaries. The activities of Group Treasury and of the various subsidiaries are
regularly reviewed and monitored by the CFO thus verifying the compliance of operations within the approved
guidelines and limits.

The Group Treasury function is responsible for ensuring adequate funds are available to the Group’
subsidiaries as necessary to the subsidiaries’ operations and development. To this end a cash pool has been
established in several countries in which the Group operates, with funds being reallocated as appropriate across
the Group. The Group’s Treasury function is further responsible for drawing on and repaying amounts under the

F-72


-----

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**30. Financial risk management (Continued)**

Group’s revolving credit facilities. All drawings must be approved by the Group CFO and the outstanding
borrowings under each facility are reported to the Supervisory Board on a monthly basis.

**30.2. Market risk management**

Financial market risk is essentially caused by exposures to foreign currencies, interest rates and coffee price.
For further details on interest rate risk management see section 30.6 and foreign currency risk management see
section 30.7.

The Group is also exposed to commodity price risk because of coffee price fluctuations. Some of these
fluctuations can be passed on to clients through price increases in line with contractual conditions.

Coffee volumes are committed with suppliers between 1 and 6 months in advance depending on current
green bean coffee prices and expectations of future price development.

In the past the coffee contracts were predominantly denominated in USD and the Group used USD forward
contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk.

As most of the current contracted coffee volumes are in EUR the Group is no longer hedging its USD
exposure for new coffee contracts as it considers the hedging-cost as too high to make hedging a commercially
attractive measure.

Per 30 September 2018 the Group is committed to remaining USD forward contracts of which the USD
exposure is less than € 0.2 million and will expire in December 2018.

**30.3. Credit risk management**

Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations as prescribed, resulting in a
financial loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk on its trade receivables, its non-current other
financial assets and its cash and cash equivalents.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure
to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**Carrying amount**

**30 September** **30 September**

**Total exposure to credit risk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **301,210** **253,775**

Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and ongoing credit evaluation in all the subsidiaries. Due to its
large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit
risk on its trade receivables, and there were no counterparties where credit risk exceeded 5% of gross monetary
assets at any time during the year. In addition, due to the nature of the Group’s operations, a significant portion
of its revenues are received in cash.

For details on how the Group manages its credit risk arising from trade receivables see note 20.

The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents (€ 163.8 million, 2017:
€ 134.2 million) as these are spread over several institutions in different geographic areas.

Settlement risk results from the fact that the Group may not receive financial instruments from its
counterparties at the expected time. This risk is managed by monitoring counterparty activity and settlement
limits.

**30.4. Liquidity risk management**

Liquidity risk arises when a company encounters difficulties to meet commitments associated with financial
instruments. Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. This risk
is managed by limiting exposures in instruments that may be affected by liquidity problems and by actively
matching the funding horizon of debt with incoming cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring
adequate reserves are available, and through its banking facilities, in particular the Group’s revolving credit
facilities. In addition, the Group continuously monitors cash flows to ensure that adequate funds exist to settle its
liabilities.

The Group has several benchmarks and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for
using derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency
without the approval of the CFO. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency exposures without
the approval of the CFO. Wherever possible, the Group requires that subsidiaries repatriate all their excess cash
and bank balances to Group finance companies to allow the Group to ensure that adequate funds are made
available across the Group as necessary.

**Liquidity available through financing facilities**

As part of the senior debt refinancing, the senior revolving credit facility was upsized from € 100 million to
€ 150 million as of 2 February 2018. The amounts drawn under this facility were GBP 50 million at
30 September 2018 (30 September 2017: € 0 million). The interest rate on this senior revolving credit facility has

**30.5. Capital management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as disclosed in note 23 offset by cash and
bank balances) and equity of the Group (comprising share capital, share premium, additional paid in capital,
currency translation reserves, hedging reserves and retained earnings).

**30.6. Interest rate risk management**

Interest rate risk comprises the cash flow risk that results from changes in interest rates The Group’s secured
loan notes carry fixed and variable rates (Note 23.2) and notes due to parent undertakings carry fixed rates. As
these loans form the significant part of the Group’s borrowings the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is
relatively limited. Interest on the Group’s revolving credit facility is linked to LIBOR, and at 30 September 2018
GBP 50 million was outstanding on this facility (2017: nil).

The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments are as follows:

**30 September 2018** **30 September 2017**

**Total variable-rate instruments** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **(226,648)** **127,263**

**Interest rate risk sensitivity**

The sensitivity is based on the Group’s total variable rate instruments at 30 September, assuming the
amount of the liabilities outstanding and the financial assets held at the end of the reporting period was
outstanding for the whole year.

At 30 September 2018, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower, with all other assumptions
held constant and the outstanding liabilities as well as held assets assumed constant for the whole year, profit
after taxation would decrease/increase by € 2.9 million (€ 0.6 million respectively in financial year ended
30 September 2017).

A 100 basis points change is used for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis as it represents management’s
assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.

**30.7. Foreign currency risk management**

Foreign currency transaction risk arises because subsidiaries may undertake transactions in foreign
currencies such as the import of machines and the acquisition of services and the related borrowings. Translation

**30. Financial risk management (Continued)**

exposure arises from the consolidation of the Group accounts into euro and is not hedged but managed primarily
through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.

In order to minimise the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Group entered into cross currency
swaps. The cross currency swaps have been terminated on 5 February 2018 due to the refinancing of the Group,
resulting in a net positive € 6.8 million cash proceed. On 2 February 2018, the Group entered into new cross
currency swaps, in value of € 404 million, with a maturity date of 1 October 2021 (see note 31.3).

**Exposure to currency risk**

Since each of the Group’s subsidiaries invoices its customers in its functional currency and since the largest
part of its cost base is also denominated in its functional currency, the exposure to currency risk within the
trading subsidiaries of the Group is not significant.

Cross currency swaps


Periodic mid-market values are based on
observable inputs including foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. A credit
spread is added to the standard, risk-free
discount curve, determined by comparing the
composite yield of a basket of fixed-rate bonds
issued by entities with similar credit
characteristics to the Company, to the riskfree rate.

**31.3. Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges**

The Group holds certain cross currency swaps in order to hedge against the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on the Group’s interest payments and borrowings. Part of the cross currency swaps entered into in
June 2014 have been designated as cash flow hedges to the extent that they represent an effective accounting
hedge. These hedging instruments have been terminated in May 2016 and therefore hedge accounting was
discontinued prospectively. The remaining hedge reserve of the terminated hedging instruments have been fully
reclassified from equity to profit and loss when the original exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s interest
payments and borrowings impact profit or loss.

No hedge accounting is applied to the new cross currency swaps the Group entered as part of the refinancing
process described below.

The Group applied hedge accounting for raw material purchases at the Roaster entity after the USD forward
contracts and accounted for the fair valuation of the contracts in the hedge reserve € 0.2 m gain. As most of the
contracts for purchase of raw material are in functional currency, the Group is no longer applying USD forward
contracts. Per 30 September 2018 the Group is committed to remaining USD forward contracts of which the
USD exposure is low and will expire in December 2018.

At 30 September 2017 the derivative financial instruments had a positive fair value of net € 1.8 million, with
the below conditions:

**Original trade** **Notional** **Carrying**

The above cross currency swaps have been terminated on 5 February 2018 following Group’s debt
refinancing, resulting in a net positive € 6.8 million cash proceeds.

**32.1. Acquisition of Pelican Rouge: measurement period adjustments**

In September 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of the Pelican Rouge Group, through the
acquisition by Selecta AG of 100 % of Pelican Rouge Group B.V.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3—Business
Combinations, to incorporate the acquired entities in the Group financial statements.

The Pelican Rouge Group results were incorporated in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the
24 days between the acquisition date, on 7 September 2017, and the closing date of the
Group’s consolidated financial statements, on 30 September 2017.

Pelican Rouge Group contributed during these 24 days € 36.6 million revenue and a net loss of € 2.4 million
to the Group’s consolidated results.

The Group’s consolidated balance sheet incorporates the acquired assets and liabilities of the Pelican Rouge
Group measured at fair value.

The consideration for Pelican Rouge group was structured as follows:

The cash consideration transferred of € 119.3 million consisted of a repayment of Pelican Rouge debt, on
the day of change of control to the external lenders.

The new Selecta loans issued of € 374.8 million on the day of change of control, were in exchange for a
Pelican Rouge debt, resulting in a non-cash transaction.

Measurement of fair values:

The identification and measurement process of intangible assets was conducted by a transaction advisory
firm, leading to the provisional recognition of Pelican Rouge brand and customer contracts values, as well as the
corresponding deferred tax liabilities, in Selecta Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
September 2017.

The relief-from-royalty method was used to assess the Pelican Rouge trademark, it considers the discounted
estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned.
The customer contracts were assessed with the multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present
value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows
related to contributory assets.

The goodwill is attributable mainly to the synergies expected to be achieved from integrating Pelican Rouge
into Selecta. Shared best practices and know-how across a broader range of segments will enable further
operational improvements and investments in innovation as well as quicker roll-outs of new technologies,
resulting in an enhanced consumer experience. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes.

New information has been obtained within one year of the date of acquisition about facts and circumstances
that existed at the date of acquisition. According to IFRS 3, accounting for the acquisition has been revised, as

The acquisition goodwill was adjusted during the year by a net amount of € 3.4 million resulting from fair
value adjustments: these included the release of a significant provision related to a risk which was deemed highly
unlikely to materialise, as well as various estimation and accounting alignments or corrections, such as: the final
alignment to Selecta Group accounting policies on allowances for obsolete inventories and bad debt; the fair
value measurement of property plant & equipment items to market value resulting in an impairment; corrections

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**32. Business combinations (Continued)**

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3—Business
Combinations, to incorporate the acquired entity in the Group financial statements.

Argenta’s results after 2 February 2018 are included in the Group’s financial results, with a contribution to
revenue € 137.2 million and net profit of € 1.8 million.

The Group’s consolidated balance sheet incorporates the acquired assets and liabilities of Argenta measured
at fair values as part of the acquisition’s preliminary purchase price allocation.

The acquisition of Argenta was the result of:

   - The buying out of a majority shareholder Motion Equity Partners and a minority shareholder Temma,
amounting to a cash consideration of € 22.7 million

   - The contribution of Argenta by KKR in exchange for a loan payable to Selecta Group Midco S.a.r.l
(the shareholder of Selecta Group B.V), which was offset by the issuance of shares by Selecta Group
BV to Selecta MidCo, translating into a non-cash consideration of € 200.4 million.

Argenta’s senior debt in value of € 201.2 million was refinanced as part of the Selecta Group debt
refinancing.

A summary of the acquisition is presented below, and includes the provisional results of the purchase price
allocation to the acquired intangible and tangible assets, as well as to the acquired liabilities:

Measurement of fair values:

The process of identification and measurement of intangible assets was conducted internally leading to the
provisional recognition of Argenta’s customer contracts values, and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities, in
Selecta Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018.

The customer contracts were assessed with the multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the
present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash
flows related to contributory assets.

The goodwill is attributable mainly to the market entry into Italy and with that expanding the Groups
European Footprint. Argenta is widely recognized as a benchmark for operational excellence and a leader in
coffee services and vending innovations including micro markets, cashless payment technologies and healthy
on-the-go food retail offerings. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

If new information obtained within one year of the date of acquisition about facts and circumstances that
existed at the date of acquisition justifies adjustments to the acquisition values presented above, then the
accounting for the acquisition will be revised.

**32.3. Minor acquisitions within Argenta**

As of 1 March 2018 Argenta acquired a 50.8% stake in Tramezzino ITI’s.r.l, an Italian company in the food
delivery sector.

This was a result of a step by step contracted stake acquisition, until this increase before 1 March 2018
Argenta used to hold 32.18% and the assets were accounted for as an investment.

The results of Tramezzino are consolidated from 1 March 2018, resulting in the below preliminary goodwill
allocation:

From the total value of the investment, € 0.8 million cash relates to the share of ownership acquired after
Argenta’s acquisition by Selecta.

In addition, in June 2018 Argenta acquired three local vending businesses (Plus Service, Stop&Go, All Inn
Services) for a total cash value of € 11.1 million investment with the below preliminary goodwill allocation:

In the € 11.1 million purchase price, € 1.3 million is to be settled after 30 September 2018, and is recorded
as a liability.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**32. Business combinations (Continued)**

Express Vending is involved in micro market design in the UK. Its Express HUB, with its open plan
refreshment area, extensive product range and self-scan kiosks, will enable the Group to complement Selecta’s
Foodie’s micro market offering.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3—Business
Combinations, to incorporate the acquired entity in the Group financial statements.

The Express Vending results were incorporated in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for days
between the acquisition date, and the closing date of the Group’s consolidated financial statements, on
30 September 2018.

Express Vending contributed € 7.2 million revenue and a net profit for the period of € 0.8 million to the
Group’s result for the year ended 30 September 2018.

The Group’s consolidated balance sheet incorporates the acquired assets and liabilities of Express Vending
measured at fair value, which amounts are preliminary and all the consideration in excess of net assets was
recorded as a preliminary goodwill.

In the consideration transferred of € 69.8 million, € 9.2 million relates to an amount held on an escrow
account until finalisation of the completion accounts by January 2019 and the calculation of the final purchase
price.

The consideration for Express vending is structured as follows:

**Not yet allocated preliminary goodwill** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **60,787**

Measurement of fair values:

The goodwill is attributable mainly to the synergies expected to be achieved from integrating Express
Vending into Selecta UK.

If new information obtained within one year of the date of acquisition about facts and circumstances that
existed at the date of acquisition identifies adjustments to the above amounts, or any additional provisions that
existed at the date of acquisition, then the accounting for the acquisition will be revised.

**32.5. Effect of acquisitions on the financial statements**

As a result of the various acquisitions during the financial year ended 30 September 2018, if these had
occurred on 1 October 2017, management calculates that consolidated net revenue would have been € 1.6 billion,
and consolidated loss for the year would have been € 115 million. In determining these amounts, management
has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of acquisition would
have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2017.

With regards to the Pelican Rouge Group acquisition completed during the financial year of 30 September
2017, if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2016, management estimates that consolidated revenue would
have been € 1.3 billion, and consolidated loss for the year would have been € 178 million. In determining these
amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the
date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2016.

**33. Disposals**

**33.1. Disposal of Selecta Finland**

As an outcome of the antitrust clearance process conducted with the European Union Commission prior to
the acquisition of Pelican Rouge, the Group has been required to dispose Selecta Finland within six months after
the Pelican Rouge acquisition.

The deconsolidation of the company took place as effective of 1 October 2017, as a result of the change of
control date defined as per the agreement.

Selecta Finland was presented as a disposal group held for sale in the consolidated financial statement per
30 September 2017.

loss relates to customer contracts and goodwill relating to Selecta Finland share, as well as € 0.8 million relating
to a cumulated foreign exchange loss recycled to profit and loss.

**33.2. Disposal of Custompack**

On 19 September 2018 Custompack Ltd was sold to PortionPack Europe Group, the European market leader
in the field of portion packed products, via its UK based company Single Source Ltd. Custompack was part of the
Region South, UK & Ireland.

Custompack focuses on the provision of single portion items such as wet sauces, dry products and portion
packing to its clients from its assembly facilities in Telford in the UK. Given Selecta’s strategies around
strenghtening its leading position as unattended self-service convenience food and beverage operator in Europe,
Custompack was divested as a non-core business.

**34. Share based payments**

In April 2018 the Group implemented a long term incentive plan for key senior management called
«Management incentive plan» (MIP). Entitled managers entered into the plan in the following months by signing
a deed of adherence. The individual deed signing date represents the grant date. Managers subscribed to 80 % of
the total plan volume as by September 30, 2018.

**34. Share based payments (Continued)**

The MIP offers the opportunity to invest in the following categories of shares of one of Selecta Group
B.V.’s parents (which is not in the scope of the consolidation of these financial statements) at nominal value. The
following investments were made by 30 September 2018:

   - 22,738 ordinary shares, with a nominal value of EUR 227 representing 0.86 % of the Company’s
parent’s share capital,

   - 186,157 “Additional shares”, with a nominal value of EUR 1,862 representing 7 % of the Company’s
parent’s share capital; and

   - 477,291,100 Preferred equity certificates (PECs) of the Company’s parent’s equity, with a total
nominal value of EUR 4,772,911

Managers will be able to exercise their shares on the event of a change of control or a listing of the
Company. In case of a termination of employment before an exit event a manager would become a good or a bad
leaver depending on the circumstances of his termination. A good leaver’s vested shares and PECs would be
reimbursed at fair value whereas unvested shares would be reimbursed at cost. If a manager becomes a bad leaver
all shares would be reimbursed at cost.

The MIP is a group share-based payment plan under IFRS 2. Due to the fact that the plan does not result in
an obligation for the Group to settle the plan is classified as an equity settled plan

As a result of the above, the vesting period will either be:

Scenario 1: Full vesting on the event of change of control or a listing of the Company for managers who
stay with Selecta by that point in time.

Scenario 2: Graded vesting (with 20% vesting at the grant date and at each anniversary additional 20%) over
the period of four years for managers who become good leavers.

Due to the fact that a change of control or a listing of the Company have been assessed as not more likely
than not the Group applied graded vesting accounting as described in scenario 2.

The MIP had no significant impact on the Group’s financial statements for the year ended September 30,
2018 (i.e. no impact on the loss for the year and the Group’s equity).

**35. Commitments for expenditures**

**Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Directors on the**
**Audit Consolidated Financial Statements of**

**Selecta Group B.V., Amsterdam**

**Opinion**

As independent auditor, we have audited the consolidated financial statements of Selecta Group B.V. and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2018, and the
consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement
of changes in consolidated equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended 30 September
2018, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 September 2018, and of its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS).

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
_Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the requirements_
of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the IESBA Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other Matter**

This set of consolidated financial statements has voluntarily been prepared by the Board of Directors. Our
report thereon has been prepared at the request of the Board of Directors and does not represent a statutory
auditor’s report required in accordance with the laws and regulations in the Netherlands.

**Responsibility of Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Board of Directors of Selecta Group B.V. is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as Board of
Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

F-93


-----

**Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Directors on the**
**Audit Consolidated Financial Statements of**

**Selecta Group B.V., Amsterdam**

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

   - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to
continue as a going concern.

   - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1. General Information**

Selecta Group B.V. (“the Company”) is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. The Company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as “the Group” or “the Selecta
Group”. The Group is a pan-European vending and coffee services company.

These consolidated financial statements do not represent statutory financial statements of the parent entity
Selecta Group B.V. prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP and the requirements of the Dutch chamber of
commerce and have been prepared voluntarily by the Board of Directors.

**2. Basis of preparation**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for
the revaluation of certain financial instruments. The principal accounting policies are set out below.

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies**

There are no other new or amended standards or interpretations which have been published and become
effective on or after 1 October 2017 that are relevant to the Group’s operations.

The Group is currently reviewing its financial reporting for the new and amended standards which take
effect on or after 1 October 2017 and which the Group did not voluntarily adopt early.

At present, no detailed assessment has been conducted on the effects on the Group financial statements in
relation to the implementation of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.

IFRS 16 will notably introduce a revision of the distinction applied currently between finance and operating
leases. Selecta, as a lessee, will generally have to recognize right-of-use assets and leasing obligations for leases,
if it has the right to use the underlying asset.

**3.3. Basis of consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), see note 41. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting
policies into line with those used by other members of the Group and the IFRS.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

In all the following disclosure sections, Pelican Rouge’s consolidated balance sheet is integrated as part of
the balance sheet positions disclosed, whereas Pelican Rouge’s consolidated statement of profit and loss is
apportioned to the 24 days in September consolidated under the Selecta Group, between the acquisition date and
September 30, 2017 (note 32).

**3.4. Business combinations**

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business
combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets acquired, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of
the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion
of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

**3.5. Foreign currencies**

**Foreign currencies in individual financial statements**

The functional currency of each group company is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial
position of each entity are translated in Euros (“EUR” or “€”), which is the presentation currency for the
consolidated financial statements. Euro is the currency that management uses when controlling and monitoring
the performance and financial position of the Group.

Transactions in currencies other than the group company’s functional currency (foreign currency
transactions) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date on which the transactions were entered
into, or a close approximation thereof. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are maintained at
the historical exchange rates and are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

**Foreign currencies in consolidated financial statements**

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s
foreign operations are expressed in Euros using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and
expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as other comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s
currency translation reserve. Such exchange differences are reclassified from equity to statement of profit or loss
in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.

The foreign currency rates applied against the Euro were as follows:

**30 September 2017** **30 September 2016**

**3.6. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Maintenance and repair
costs are expensed as incurred.

The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that is different from that
of the asset to which it belongs is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values and
depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a
prospective basis.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same
basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss.

**3.7. Goodwill and intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
subsidiary recognised at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. These cash-generating units are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication
that a unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the amount attributable to goodwill is included in the determination of the profit
or loss on disposal.

**Other intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill
where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their value can be measured reliably.

**Trademark**

The trademarks recognised by the Group have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. The
trademarks are allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to the cash-generating units that are tested for
impairment annually as described in the section on Goodwill above.

**Customer contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life and are amortised over the useful life of 15 years.

**Software**

Software licences are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that they will generate future
economic benefits. They are amortised using the straight-line method over three-five years.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software

F-106


-----

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets and are amortised by the straight-line method
over three to five years when the following criteria are met:

   - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

   - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

   - there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

   - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

   - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and

   - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures
that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Other software licences and software development costs are expensed as incurred. No intangible asset
arising from research (or from research phase of an internal project) is recognised. Expenditure on research (or
on the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.

**3.8. Impairment of non-current assets other than goodwill or trademark**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its tangible and
intangible assets other than goodwill or trademark may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can
be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can
be identified.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the
asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the
statement of profit or loss.

**3.9. Prepayments and accrued income**

Prepayments and accrued income comprise payments made in advance relating to the following year, and
income relating to the current year, which will not be received until after the balance sheet date. Prepayments are
measured at the nominal amount of the payments. Accrued income is measured at amortised costs.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**3.10. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value corresponds to
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less point-of-sales costs. A valuation allowance on
inventories is recorded, when the cost of inventories is greater than their net realisable value.

**3.11. Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers**

Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers include agreed discounts from suppliers’ list prices,
value and volume-related rebates. Income from value and volume-related rebates is recognised based on actual
purchases in the period as a proportion of total purchases made or forecast to be made over the rebate period.
Agreed discounts relating to inventories are credited to the statement of profit or loss as the goods are sold.
Rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the balance sheet date are deducted from their carrying
values so that the costs of inventories are recorded net of applicable rebates. Rebates received in respect of
property, plant and equipment are deducted from the costs capitalised.

**3.12. Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. An impairment loss on trade
receivables is recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference
between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s
original effective interest rate.

**3.13. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash
on hand, cash in points-of-sale, call deposits with banks, and other short-term, highly liquid financial assets with
original maturities of three months or less.

Due to the Group’s business model, significant cash balances are held at year-end on behalf of the Group by
external cash collecting firms, or en route to or from such cash counting firms. These amounts are included in
other current assets.

Bank overdrafts are included within current liabilities on the balance sheet.

**3.14. Assets held for sale**

Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is
highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the
remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets,
deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets or investment properties, which continue to be measured in
accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale
and subsequent gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised
or depreciated, and equity accounted investments are no longer accounted for using equity accounting.

**3.15. Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable

F-108


-----

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability.

When some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be recovered from a third
party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that recovery will be received and the
amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

**3.16. Loans due to parent undertaking / borrowings**

Loans due to parent undertaking or borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.

**3.17. Derivative financial instruments**

The Group uses from time to time derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and/or foreign exchange risk.

Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date, with changes therein generally recognised
in profit or loss (finance income or finance costs).

Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument and the economic
hedge created by the derivative financial statement is deemed to be effective, the changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The amount accumulated in
equity is retained in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods
during which the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.

In order to prove the effectiveness of the hedge the instrument is extensively documented at inception and
regularly tested to ensure that it remains effective. Where the hedge, or a portion of the hedge, is deemed not to
be effective, the change in fair value is recorded directly in finance income or finance costs in the statement of
profit or loss.

**3.18. Accruals and deferred income**

Accruals and deferred income comprise expenses relating to the current year, which will not be paid until
after the balance sheet date and cash received in advance, relating to the following year. Deferred income is
measured at the nominal value of the payments received less, if appropriate, cumulative amortisation in
accordance with IAS 18. Accruals are measured at amortised cost.

**3.19. Taxation**

The credit or charge for current income tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which
are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates of the countries where the Group has operations.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary
differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the
corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.

Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred
income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it can be reasonably expected that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities, which affects neither taxable nor accounting income.

F-109


-----

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Current income tax and deferred income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case it is
also recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists
to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

**3.20. Employee benefits**

The Group maintains various defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.

Defined benefit obligations are largely covered through pension plan assets of pension funds that are legally
separated and independent from the Group. These are managed by a board of trustees consisting of
representatives of the employees and the employer. The organisation, management and financing of the pension
plans comply with the applicable pension regulations. Employees and pensioners or their survivors receive
statutorily determined benefits upon leaving the company or retiring as well as in the event of death or disability.
These benefits are financed through employer and employee contributions.

**Defined benefit plans**

In the case of defined benefits pension plans, the pension expenses and obligations are valued according to
the projected unit credit method. The corresponding calculations are carried out yearly by independent qualified
actuaries.

Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.

All re-measurement gains and losses on the net defined benefit liability are charged or credited in other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting past service cost is
generally recognised in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The Group recognises
gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

**Defined contribution plans**

In the case of defined contribution pension plans, the Group has no further payment obligations once the
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an expense when the employees render the
corresponding service to the Group, which normally occurs in the same year in which the contributions are paid.
Payments made to state-managed plans are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the
Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution pension plan.

**3.21. Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, excluding trade discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.

**Sale of goods**

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered to the client site or when goods
are purchased from a machine by a customer, depending on the contract terms.

Revenue may be received directly in the form of cash from the consumer, or may be invoiced to a client
periodically.

F-110


-----

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Where revenue is received in the form of cash, the amount recognised is the amount of cash received until
the last date on which the cash was collected from the machine, plus an estimate of the sales between this date
and the period end calculated based on historical trends.

Where the sale of goods is invoiced to the client, the amount recognised is based either on the amounts
delivered to the client or based on the consumption in the machines, depending on the specific contractual terms.
Where revenue is recognised based on consumption in the machines, the amount recognised is based on the last
recorded consumption from the machine plus an estimate of the sales between this date and the period end
calculated based on historical trends.

**Rendering of services**

Selecta also provides services to clients in the form of machine rentals, technical services and hygiene
services. Where the income is a fixed amount for the period the amount of revenue recognised is based on this
fixed amount. Where the income is dependent on the work performed, the revenue is recognised based on records
of technical site visits or other services provided.

**Interest income**

Income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest rate that is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of
the financial asset.

**Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

**3.22. Leases**

The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment where the
Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are
capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between repayment of the outstanding
liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in
non-current liabilities or current liabilities as appropriate. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to
the statement of profit or loss over the lease period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance
leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Other lease agreements are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**3.23. Purchasing income**

The Group receives certain rebates from its suppliers in respect of the purchase of vending machines and
consumables. Where the rebates are received in respect of vending machines which are capitalised within
property, plant and equipment, the cost of those vending machines is reduced by the amount of the rebate
received. In relation to vending machines and consumables sold to customers and recognised within revenue, the
cost of goods sold and the cost of inventories are reduced by the amount of the rebate received.

**3.24. Finance costs**

Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and finance leases calculated using the effective
interest method, fair value losses on derivatives classified as held for trading and foreign exchange losses.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance income or finance expense
depending on whether the total foreign currency movements represent a gain or a loss accordingly.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4. Use of estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of
assets and liabilities in the next financial year are discussed below.

**Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives**

The carrying amounts of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated and which include
other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an
indication that they may be impaired. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on
their values in use. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with the most
up-to-date business plans that have been formally approved by management. The amounts and key assumptions
used for the value in use calculations are set out in notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Customer Contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life and are amortised over the determined life time of 15 years.

The Group actively monitors retention rates on customer contracts and considers other relevant factors
which may provide an indication of impairment. The amounts are described in note 16 to the consolidated
financial statements.

**Employee benefits**

The present value of the pension obligations depends on a variety of factors that are estimated annually
using a number of assumptions, including the discount rate to be applied to determine the present value of
defined benefit obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that
have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The amounts and principal
assumptions used are described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Deferred income tax assets**

Deferred income tax assets on unused tax losses carried forward are recognised when it is probable that
there will be future taxable profits against which the losses can be utilised. The assessment of recoverability of
the recognised deferred income tax assets is based on assumptions regarding future profits and is derived from
the latest budgets and business plans of the Group. The amounts are described in note 26 to the consolidated
financial statements.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is based on management’s best estimate of the consideration required
to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties
surrounding the obligation.

Provisions for warranties are ordinarily determined by product line and are based on statistics including the
likelihood of a break down occurring and the average cost of repair or replacement.

The amounts are described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4. Use of estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties (Continued)**

**Sales estimations**

Where sales are based on consumption in the machines, there may be a timing difference between the date
on which the cash was last collected from the machines or the date on which the sales readings were taken. In
this case an estimate of the sales between the date of the last cash collection or the last machine reading and the
end of the period is made. The estimate is based on historical sales trends in respect of the specific client sites
and machines. The estimated amount of sales which have been neither collected in cash nor invoiced to
customers are recorded as Accrued income and uncollected cash in points-of-sale, as disclosed in note 20.

**Inventories**

Inventories include perishable products which requires the Group to make estimates regarding the amount of
goods whose shelf life will expire before they are sold in order to determine the appropriate level of allowances
to be recorded. Such allowances are therefore calculated with reference to the level of inventories held, average
sales, and expiry dates.

Allowances for spare parts held in inventory are calculated according to the inventory turnover ratio.

Allowances for inventories are disclosed in Note 18.

**5. Segmental reporting**

The Group is organised and managed internally within four geographical regions. Each of these regions,
which are the operating segments of the Group, offers a similar portfolio of vending products and services to
consumers and customers. No operating segments have been aggregated. These segments represent the reportable
segments of the Group, as follows:

Region France: includes operating entities in France.

Region West: includes operating entities in UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium.

Region Central: included operating entities in Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Austria.

Region North: includes operating entities in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania until 30 September 2016. The operating entities in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were disposed as per
1 October 2016. Selecta Finland is an asset held for sale, see note 34.

In addition to the segments identified above, the Group reports separately on its Headquarters (HQ), which
includes corporate centre functions in Switzerland and in the Netherlands.

The profit/(loss) before finance results net and income taxes, depreciation and amortisation expense as the
operating result of the Group’s reportable segments are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, as the
Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, to assess performance and to determine how resources should be
allocated.

The decrease in goodwill corresponds to the share of goodwill attributable to the disposed subsidiaries
(Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, note 33).

The increase in goodwill relates to the Pelican Rouge group acquisition (see note 32) and is a provisional
value, since the allocation of the purchase price is provisionally determined at the end of the reporting period.
The completion of the purchase price allocation may result in further adjustment to the carrying value of Pelican
Rouge’s recorded assets, liabilities and the determination of any residual amount that will be allocated to
goodwill.

The Group will complete the initial allocation of goodwill to the newly defined cash generating units in the
financial year ending 30 September 2018, in line with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business combinations and
IAS 36 Impairment of assets.

**15.1. Impairment testing**

During the financial year the carrying values including goodwill of the cash-generating units have been
compared to their recoverable amount.

The test was conducted on the basis of the carrying values and the recoverable amounts of Selecta cash
generating units excluding Pelican Rouge. The Selecta goodwill without Pelican Rouge tested was at
€ 479.4 million as of 30 September 2017, corresponding to the prior year Selecta Group goodwill position with
the deduction of goodwill reduction resulting from the disposal of the Baltics.

It has been concluded that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amounts and therefore no
impairment is required to be recorded.

**15.2. Allocation to cash-generating units**

**Cash-generating units considered in this financial year’s impairment test**

For the purpose of the impairment testing on the aforementioned scope excluding the effect from the
business combination of Pelican Rouge Group, the Group has considered the same four cash-generating units as
in the prior year, which are identical to the Group’s operating segments based on the regions in which the Group
has operated until the end of the year ending September 2017:

Region France: includes operating entities in France.

Region West: includes operating entities in UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium.

Region Central: included operating entities in Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Austria.

Region North: includes operating entities in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway.

As of 1 October 2016 the operating entities in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were sold.

**15.3. Summary of assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing**

In undertaking the impairment test of the Selecta goodwill, the Group has used post-tax cash flow
projections for the computation of value in use based on the 2018 – 2020 business plan of the Group approved by
management, covering a three-year period. In years four to seven the Group assumes further growth of 3.0%
(2016: 3.0%).

Cash flows beyond the seven-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates as disclosed in the
table below:

**2017** **2016**

Region France . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.9% 1.7%

**16. Intangible assets (Continued)**

The trademarks are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors,
there are no foreseeable limits to the period over which the assets are expected to generate net cash inflows for
the Group.

The trademarks have been allocated to the Group’s cash generating units that are tested for impairment annually.
This year, similarly to the goodwill impairment, the scope of the testing comprises the Selecta cash generating
units, excluding Pelican Rouge, and the trademarks tested is the Selecta trademark with a carrying amount of
€ 286.3 million.

At 30 September 2017 and 2016, the trademark has been allocated as follows :

The Pelican Rouge trademark value has been determined provisionally as a result of the purchase price
allocation conducted with the support of the transaction advisory services of a professional service firm, based on
the relief from royalty valuation method.

The Pelican Rouge trademark is deemed to have an indefinite useful life as based on an analysis of all of the
relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash
inflows for the Group. Pelican Rouge as a coffee brand was founded in Antwerp in 1863.

**Customer contracts**

Selecta customer contracts acquired in the business combination in 2007 have a finite useful life and are
amortised over 15 years.

Customer contracts identified in the business combination with the Pelican Rouge Group have been
allocated a provisional value as a result of the purchase price allocation conducted with the support of the
transaction advisory services of a professional service form, based on the excess earnings valuation method.
They will be amortized over 15 years.

The average credit period on sales of goods is 30 days. No interest is charged on the trade receivables until
the end of the credit period, thereafter the charging of interest is at the discretion of local management depending
on the amounts and customers involved. Where interest is charged in respect of an overdue receivable the interest
rate applied is between 3% and 15% per annum depending on the country and the customer contract.

The Group has provided for all receivables over 360 days because historical experience indicates that
receivables that are past due beyond 360 days are not recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and 360
days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference
to past default experience.

Depending on the size of a potential new customer and the volume of trading expected, prior to accepting
new credit customers, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and
defines a suitable credit limit for the customer.

**19.1. Analysis of receivables past due but not impaired**

Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of € 7.2 million (2016:
€ 8.7 million) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for as there has not
been any significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

**30 September** **30 September**
**2017** **2016**

**€ (000’s)** **€ (000’s)**
Overdue 0–90 days . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,207 7,980

There are no significant individually impaired trade receivables at 30 September 2017 (2016: not significant).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality
of the trade receivable at the reporting date. This is in most cases evidenced by the age of the receivable, and the
Group has implemented specific policies regarding the level of provision required for the change in credit quality
based on the ageing of the receivable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the fact that the Group has a very large customer base and a
mix of credit and cash sales. Accordingly, management believes that there is no further credit provision required
in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

**22.3. Details of borrowing facilities**

In June 2014 the Group issued a € 350 million 6.5% senior secured note (ISIN: XS1078234686,
XS1078234330) and a CHF 245 million 6.5% senior secured note (ISIN: XS1078234926, XS1078235147). The
notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are traded on the Euro MTF market.

In addition the Group’s parent undertaking, Selecta Group S.a.r.L. issued a PIK loan for € 220 million, the
proceeds of which have been loaned to the Group also in the form of a PIK loan (the “PIK proceeds loan”). The
PIK proceeds loan carries an interest rate of 11.875%. In December 2015 Selecta Group S.a.r.L. granted an
additional PIK loan with the same conditions to the Group of € 5.6 million.

As part of the Pelican Rouge acquisition, new Selecta loans were issued for € 374.8 million, consisting of a
senior secured debt element of € 355.8 million and a PIK loan element of € 19.0 million both carrying an interest
rate of 4.5% at closing, with an increasing ratchet for the PIK loan element of 0.0% to 3.0% between closing and

December 2019 (1.0% in June 2018, 2.0% in December 2018, 2.50% in June 2019 and 3.0% in December 2019).
These loan facilities are not listed on the Stock Exchange.

As part of the Pelican Rouge acquisition, the Group has upsized its senior revolving credit facility by
€ 50 million, to € 100 million. The amounts drawn under this facility were fully repaid at 30 September 2017
(30 September 2016: € 29 million). The interest rate on this senior revolving credit facility has remained based
on the relevant rate of the currency drawn (LIBOR/EURIBOR) plus 3.5%.

The senior secured notes and the revolving credit facility are secured by first ranking security interests over
all the issued share capital of certain Group companies (together the “Guarantors”), certain receivables and
intercompany receivables of the Company and the Guarantors, including assignment of the PIK Proceeds Loan
and certain bank accounts of the Company.

Under the terms of the Group’s super senior revolving credit facility, a minimum net leverage ratio must be
met before further drawings may be made under the facility. The net leverage ratio represents the ratio of
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the super senior revolving credit facility agreement of the last
twelve months to Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt.

The Group has complied with the covenant obligation in the current and the previous year.

**23. Finance lease liabilities**

Finance leases relate predominantly to motor vehicles and vending equipment. The Group’s obligations
under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ title to the leased assets.

Selecta Switzerland

The pension scheme is part of the Valora Pension Fund, domiciled in Muttenz, Switzerland and is governed
by the rules of the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans
(BVG), which specifies the minimum benefits that are to be provided by pension plans. The scheme covers
multiple employers, including Selecta, with the scheme assets allocated between Selecta and the other companies
in the scheme in proportion to the mathematical reserve and savings capital as at 30 September 2017. One
employee of Selecta AG in Switzerland sits on the foundation board of the Valora Pension Fund to ensure
representation of Selecta in the wider scheme.

The designated purpose of the scheme is to protect the employees, including the employees’ dependents and
survivors, of the Valora Group of companies of Switzerland and the companies with which the scheme has
concluded an affiliation agreement against the economic consequences of old age, death and disability.

The benefits are defined in the pension plan regulations that are far above the minimum requirements
stipulated by the BVG. Retirement benefits are based on the accumulated retirement savings capital and can
either be drawn as a life-long pension or as a lump sum payment. The pension is upon retirement calculated by
multiplying the balance of the retirement savings capital with the applicable conversion rate. The retirement
savings capital results from the yearly savings contributions by both employer and employee until retirement and
carries interest thereon. The savings contributions are defined in the pension plan regulations. Minimum
contributions and minimum interest are defined by the BVG and the Federal Council respectively.

The scheme provides for a basic and supplementary plan. Under the basic plan, the wage portions above the
entry level for admission (equal to three quarters of the maximum retirement pension benefit prescribed by law)
are pensionable. The supplementary plan additionally offers coverage of wage portions that exceed the 5-fold
value of the maximum retirement pension benefit by more than CHF 5’000.

The scheme is subdivided into a risk pre-insurance and a primary insurance. The risk pre-insurance
coverage is a pure risk insurance that covers the risks of death and disability up to the age of 25. The primary
insurance begins at age 25 and is comprised of a savings facility run by the scheme and insurance covering the
death and disability risks.

The scheme participates in compulsory coverage and is entered in the register for occupational pension
providers as provided for by art. 48 of the Federal Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension
Plans Act (BVG/LPP). At minimum it provides for the benefits pursuant to BVG/LPP. The scheme is under the
regulatory supervision of the Canton of Basel Land.

UK Pelican Rouge

The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is identified as the
Pelican Rouge Retirement Benefits Plan (the “Plan”, formerly known as the Autobar Group Retirement Benefits
Plan). The scheme is managed by an independent trustee (ITS) and the ultimate authority is with the UK Pension
Regulator in case of disputes between the trustee and the company. The company accounted for this plan as
defined benefit plan because it is exposed to risks as mentioned in the paragraph ‘sensitivity analysis’.

With effect from October 2004 the Plan was closed to new members and on 31 March 2015 future accrual
stopped.. This resulted in a curtailment in the year to 31 March 2015. Prior to that, pension accrual for active
members was a proportion of the salary at retirement (or earlier date of leaving) based on length of Plan
membership. Pensions are payable for life from retirement with the option to convert some pension to a cash
lump sum at the point of retirement. A reduced pension is payable to any surviving spouse on death of the
member. Pensions in payment increase each year at various rates depending on the period when
accrued. Pensions for those members not yet retired are increased in line with the Consumer Prices Index subject
to a cap of 5% a year (applied over the whole period).

As for the other plans in the group the pension valuation has been updated by an independent qualified
actuary to 30 September 2017 for IFRS purposes (IAS 19).

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**24. Post-employment benefits (Continued)**

A number of subsidiaries in the United Kingdom are participating employers in the Plan. Individual
companies are unable to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities as each employer is exposed
to the actuarial risks associated with current and former employees of other entities that have participated in the
Plan over its lifetime.

In addition to the IFRS requirements, the UK entity is required to satisfy local regulations in the
United Kingdom. The calculation of the assets and liabilities according to local regulations is different than under
IFRS. The most recent calculation according to local regulation was carried out with a reference date of 30 June
2015. As a result of the calculation the Group agreed with the Trustees of the Plan that annual deficit funding
payments of GBP 1,900 thousands have to be made until 20 June 2020. The funding is recognised at the moment
of payment.

If the Plan’s assets are insufficient to cover the benefits promised to members the UK company might need
to increase its contributions. The assets of the Plan are held in a trust and are separated from those of the UK
company.

**Amounts included in the consolidated financial statements**

The amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in respect of defined benefit plans are
as follows:

**Defined benefit cost recognised in statement of profit or loss** . . . . . . . . . . . . . **(2,507)** **(5,795)**

Past service credit / (cost) and gains / (losses) relates to a plan amendment of the benefits payable under the
Group’s pension in scheme in Switzerland. In January 2016 the Valora pension scheme reduced the conversion
rate for calculating the retirement pension, resulting in a reduction of the future pensions to be paid and hence the
defined benefit obligation of the scheme. As communicated in June 2017 by the pension fund Valora, conversion
rates will decrease to 6.2% for men and 6.4% for women, effective on 1 January 2018.

**Actuarial assumptions**

The principal actuarial assumptions are based on local economic conditions and are as follows (weighted
average):

**2017** **2016**

Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.70%* 0.20%
Expected salary increase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.05% 1.00%
Expected pension increase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.31% 0.00%

- The discount rate increase is mainly driven by Pelican Rouge UK (2.5%) Switzerland rate is at 0.6% (vs 0.2% prior year).

The estimated duration of the plan liabilities is 18.8 years (2016: 13.9 years).

The following table shows the re-measurement gains and losses on post-employment benefit obligations
recognised in other comprehensive income:

**recognised in other comprehensive income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 16,749 94

**Sensitivity analysis**

The valuation of the pension benefit obligations is particularly sensitive with regard to changes to the
discount rate and the assumptions of pension rises and the expected mortality rate. The following table shows the
change of defined benefit obligation on the basis of a reasonably possible change to these actuarial assumptions
at 30 September 2017 and 2016:

**2017** **2016**
**€ (000’s)** **€ (000’s)**
Discount rate (+0.50%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30,725 11,332
Discount rate (-0.50%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (29,368) (12,946)
Increase in future pension (+0.25%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (7,377) (5,658)
Decrease in future pension (-0.25%)* . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,236 20
Mortality assumption -1 year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,846 5,631
Mortality assumption + 1 year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (9,857) (5,581)

- No decrease in future pension has been used for the sensitivity analysis on the pension scheme in Switzerland as the expected pension
increase assumed in the valuation is zero, and future pensions cannot be decreased.

Every sensitivity analysis considers the change of one assumption, while all other assumptions remain the
same. This approach shows the isolating effect if an individual assumption is changed, but does not consider that
some assumptions are mutually dependent.

The warranty provision represents management’s best estimate of the future outflow of economic benefits
that will be required in respect of warranties on machine sales and has been based on historical trends observed.

The provisions in respect of litigations and tax represent management’s best estimate of the future outflow
of economic benefits required to settle legal claims and tax claims made against the Group, and has been based
on advice from and discussion with the Group’s lawyers.

The restructuring provision represents amounts due to be paid in respect of certain restructuring activities
which have been initiated. The amounts provided include the costs of employee severance payments, as well as
other costs associated with closing facilities or offices.

The other provision includes besides the deferred consideration of € 27 million, a significant portion of long
service awards (jubilee benefits) to which all employees of Selecta Switzerland are entitled based on the years of
service. The calculation requires an actuarial valuation to be performed as it is based on assumptions of expected
service lengths, current service length, date of entry, monthly salary, sex, and long service awards paid in last
financial year.

**26.4. Unrecognised deferred tax assets/liabilities**

These deferred income tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that future taxable profits
will be available to utilise the losses.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would
be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such amounts are currently regarded as
permanently reinvested. The parent is not only able to control the distribution of dividends but has also no plan
for any such distribution.

Certain of the Selecta Group subsidiaries in France, Switzerland and the UK have entered into an accounts
receivable factoring programme under a pan-European factoring agreement with Factofrance S.A.S. (the Factor)
dated December 22, 2016. In accordance with this agreement, Selecta’s subsidiaries may assign eligible
receivables to the Factor at an agreed market rate in order to receive funding at any given time of up to
€15 million. The agreement is subject to terms and conditions customary for such transactions, and the Group
provided cash collateral for a specified portion of the accounts receivable so assigned. A recourse factoring
liability of a total €5.7 million is recorded on the Group’s balance sheet at 30 September, 2017 for the Selecta
Group subsidiaries in France, Switzerland and the UK. Additionally, Dutch subsidiaries acquired by the Group as
part of the Pelican Rouge Group acquisition operate recourse factoring facilities, with a recourse factoring
liability of a total €2.2 million recorded on the Group’s balance sheet at 30 September, 2017.

The Group also holds reverse factoring facilities in the subsidiaries acquired from Pelican Rouge in Spain
for €9.7 million.

**29. Equity**

**29.1. Share capital, share premium and additional paid-in capital**

The Group’s share capital consists of 187,000 fully paid ordinary shares (2016: 187,000) with a nominal

**30. Financial risk management**

**30.1. Risk management framework**

Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Board of Directors has
overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s financial policies. Group’s management
reports on a monthly basis to the Board of Directors on the Group’s performance. The Board of Directors meets
approximately 6 times a year and meeting minutes are documented. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is
responsible for setting financial strategies, which are executed by Group Treasury and by the Group’s
subsidiaries. The activities of Group Treasury and of the various subsidiaries are regularly reviewed and
monitored by the CFO thus verifying the compliance of operations within the approved guidelines and limits.

The Group Treasury function is responsible for ensuring adequate funds are available to the Group’s
subsidiaries as necessary. To this end a cash pool has been established in respect of some countries in which the
Group operates, and funds are reallocated across the Group as necessary. The Group’s Treasury function is also
responsible for drawing on and repaying amounts under the Group’s revolving credit facilities to meet the cash
needs of the Group. All drawings must be approved by the CFO and the outstanding borrowings under each
facility are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.

**30.2. Market risk management**

Financial market risk is essentially caused by exposures to foreign currencies, interest rates and coffee price.
For further details on interest rate risk management see section 30.6 and foreign currency risk management see
section 30.7.

The Group is also exposed to commodity price risk because of coffee price fluctuations. Some of these
fluctuations can be passed on to clients through price increases in line with contractual conditions. The Group has
periodically assessed the economic impact of hedging the coffee prices but considers the hedging-cost as too high
to make hedging a commercially attractive measure. However whilst the Group does not enter into hedging
instruments into coffee prices, coffee volumes are committed with suppliers between 1 and 6 months in advance
depending on current green bean coffee prices and expectations of future price development.

**30. Financial risk management (Continued)**

**30.3. Credit risk management**

Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations as prescribed, resulting in a
financial loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk on its trade receivables, its non-current other
financial assets and its cash and cash equivalents.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure
to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**Carrying amount**
**Note** **2017** **2016**
**€ (000’s)** **€ (000’s)**

Trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 75,093 40,939

**Total exposure to credit risk** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **114,190** **70,115**

Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and ongoing credit evaluation in all the subsidiaries. Due to its
large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit
risk on its trade receivables, and there were no counterparties where credit risk exceeded 5% of gross monetary
assets at any time during the year. In addition, due to the nature of the Group’s operations, a significant portion
of its revenues are received in cash.

For details on how the Group manages its credit risk arising from trade receivables see note 19.

The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents (€ 134.8 million, 2016
€ 66.9 million) as these are spread over several institutions in different geographic areas.

Settlement risk results from the fact that the Group may not receive financial instruments from its
counterparties at the expected time. This risk is managed by monitoring counterparty activity and settlement
limits.

**30.4. Liquidity risk management**

Liquidity risk arises when a company encounters difficulties to meet commitments associated with financial
instruments. Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. This risk
is managed by limiting exposures in instruments that may be affected by liquidity problems and by actively
matching the funding horizon of debt with incoming cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring
adequate reserves are available, and through its banking facilities, in particular the Group’s revolving credit
facilities. In addition, the Group continuously monitors cash flows to ensure that adequate funds exist to settle its
liabilities.

The Group has several benchmarks and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for
using derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency
without the approval of the CFO. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency exposures without
the approval of the CFO. Wherever possible, the Group requires that subsidiaries repatriate all their excess cash
and bank balances to Group finance companies to allow the Group to ensure that adequate funds are made
available across the Group as necessary.

**Liquidity available through financing facilities**

As part of the refinancing of the Group in the year ended 30 September 2014 the Group had entered into a
€ 50 million super senior revolving credit facility, upsized to € 100 million with the Pelican Rouge acquisition.

**30.5. Capital management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as disclosed in note 22 offset by cash and
bank balances) and equity of the Group (comprising share capital, share premium, additional paid in capital,
currency translation reserves, hedging reserves and retained earnings).

**30.6. Interest rate risk management**

Interest rate risk comprises the cash flow risk that results from changes in interest rates. The Group’s
secured loan notes and notes due to parent undertakings carry interest at fixed rates. As these loans form the
significant part of the Group’s borrowings the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is relatively limited. Interest
on the Group’s revolving credit facility is linked to LIBOR, however the amounts involved are relatively limited
in comparison to the overall borrowings, and at 30 September 2017 nil were outstanding on this facility (2016:
€ 29.0 million).

The interest rate on the Group’s secured loan notes amounts to 6.5%, on the new loans related to PR
acquisition 4.5%, and on the loans due to parent undertakings to 11.875%, as well as on the Group’s revolving

**30. Financial risk management (Continued)**

credit facility to LIBOR plus 3.5%. The remaining contractual maturity in respect of the Group’s borrowings is
disclosed in Note 30.4.

The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments are as follows:

**Total variable-rate instruments** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **127,263** **33,558**

**Interest rate risk sensitivity**

The sensitivity is based on the Group’s total variable rate instruments at 30 September, assuming the
amount of the liabilities outstanding and the financial assets held at the end of the reporting period was
outstanding for the whole year.

At 30 September 2017, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower, with all other assumptions
held constant and the outstanding liabilities as well as held assets assumed constant for the whole year, profit
after taxation would decrease/increase by € 0.6 million (€ 0.3 million respectively in financial year ended
30 September 2016).

A 100 basis points change is used for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis as it represents management’s
assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.

**30.7. Foreign currency risk management**

Foreign currency transaction risk arises because subsidiaries sometimes undertake transactions in foreign
currencies such as the import of machines and the acquisition of services and the related borrowings. Translation
exposure arises from the consolidation of the Group accounts into euro and is not hedged but managed primarily
through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.

In order to minimise the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Group has entered into cross
currency swaps in the year ended 30 September 2014, and renewed the existing cross currency swaps in June
2017 for another year, in order to hedge against the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s interest
payments (see note 31.3).

**Exposure to currency risk**

Since each of the Group’s subsidiaries invoices its customers in its functional and since the significant part
of its cost base is also denominated in its functional currency, the exposure to currency risk within the trading
subsidiaries of the Group is not significant.

Certain of the holding companies based in Switzerland, and therefore with Swiss Francs as their functional
currency, have loan receivables and payables, both with external parties and with other Group companies,
denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. The table below shows the total net financial
assets / (liabilities) which are exposed to currency risk, by currency, arising in those entities:

**Foreign currency sensitivity**

Most Group companies transact the majority of their business in their functional currency. For Selecta
Group, transaction risks arise as a result of financing based on another currency than the functional currency of
the respective group company. The transaction risks analysis has been performed to include variations in the
exchange rate between CHF, GBP and SEK against EUR as those three currencies represent major currencies
other than the functional currency of the respective group company. The Group’s sensitivity analysis has been
determined based on the Group’s net transaction exposure as at the end of the reporting period. A ±10 percent
change is used for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis as it represents management’s assessment of a
reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

At 30 September 2016 a ±10 percent change in the CHF, GBP and SEK against EUR would impact the net
profit and the equity of the Group according to the table below. The amounts below show the increase in net
profit and equity which would come about as a result of a 10% strengthening of the EUR against each of the
currencies below. For a 10% weakening of the EUR against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable
decrease in net profit and equity.

**Valuation technique**

Periodic mid-market values are based on
observable inputs including foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. A credit
spread is added to the standard, risk-free
discount curve, determined by comparing the
composite yield of a basket of fixed-rate bonds
issued by entities with similar credit
characteristics to the Company, to the risk-free
rate.

**31.3. Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges**

The Group holds certain cross currency swaps in order to hedge against the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on the Group’s interest payments and borrowings. Part of the cross currency swaps entered into in
June 2014 have been designated as cash flow hedges to the extent that they represent an effective accounting
hedge. These hedging instruments have been terminated in May 2016 and therefore hedge accounting was
discontinued prospectively. The remaining hedge reserve of the terminated hedging instruments have been fully
reclassified from equity to profit and loss when the original exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s interest
payments and borrowings impact profit or loss. No hedge accounting is applied to the new cross currency swaps
the Group entered into in the renewal transactions in the reporting period.

At 30 September 2017 the derivative financial instruments had a positive fair value of net € 1.8 million, at
prior year end had a negative fair value of net € 5.5 million. The fair value movement was recognized in the
P&L.

The following table shows the original trade date, maturity date, notional amounts and carrying amount of
the cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges:

**31.4. Master netting or similar agreements**

The Group enters into derivative transactions ISDA and Swiss master agreements under which, in the event
of a default, the amounts owed by each counterparty at any given point in time are aggregated into a single net
amount that is payable by one party to the other.

**32. Business combinations**

On 7 September 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of Pelican Rouge Group, through the acquisition
by Selecta AG of 100% ownership of Pelican Rouge Group B.V.

Taking control of Pelican Rouge enhances Selecta’s credit profile and creates a leading vending operator
and coffee services provider for the workplace, on-the-go as well as hotels, restaurants and cafes (“HoReCa”)
across Europe. The transaction enables to bring together Selecta’s and Pelican Rouge’s complementary service
networks and provide more options for our customers.

The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3—Business
Combinations, to incorporate the acquired entities in the Group financial statements.

The Pelican Rouge Group results were incorporated in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the
24 days between the acquisition date, on 7 September 2017, and the closing date of the Group’s consolidated
financial statements, on 30 September 2017.

Pelican Rouge Group contributed during the 24 days € 36.6 million revenue and a net loss for the period of
€ 2.4 million to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2016, management estimates
that consolidated revenue would have been € 1.3 billion, and consolidated loss for the year would have been
€ 178 million. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments,

determined provisionally, that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had
occurred on 1 October 2016.

The Group’s consolidated balance sheet incorporates the acquired assets and liabilities of the Pelican Rouge
Group measured at fair value.

The consideration for Pelican Rouge group is structured as follows:

The cash consideration transferred of € 119.3 million consisted of a repayment of Pelican Rouge debt, on
the day of change of control to the external lenders.

The new Selecta loans issued of € 374.8 million on the day of change of control, were in exchange for a
Pelican Rouge debt, resulting in a non cash transaction.

The deferred consideration is represented by the issued Contingent Value Right (CVR) Notes which have a
maximum value of € 27 million, and consequently a provision for € 27 million has been recorded. The CVR
Notes are to pay out the (positive) difference between the €27 million and the actual liability / settlement for the
corporate income tax claim with the Dutch tax authorities, on the later of (i) the first anniversary of the
completion date of the transaction; and (ii) the date of full and final settlement of the tax issue.

**32. Business combinations (Continued)**

Measurement of fair values:

The identification and measurement process of intangible assets was conducted by a transaction advisory
service company, leading to the provisional recognition of Pelican Rouge brand and customer contracts values, as
well as the corresponding deferred tax liabilities, in Selecta Group’s consolidated financial statements for the
year ending September 2017.

The relief-from-royalty method was used to assess the Pelican Rouge trademark, it considers the discounted
estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned.
The customer contracts were assessed with the multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present
value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows
related to contributory assets.

The goodwill is attributable mainly to the synergies expected to be achieved from integrating Pelican Rouge
into Selecta. Shared best practices and know-how across a broader range of segments will enable further
operational improvements and investments in innovation as well as quicker roll-outs of new technologies,
resulting in an enhanced consumer experience. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes.

If new information obtained within one year of the date of acquisition about facts and circumstances that
existed at the date of acquisition identifies adjustments to the above amounts, or any additional provisions that
existed at the date of acquisition, then the accounting for the acquisition will be revised.

**33. Disposals**

During the year, the Group’s operating entities in the Baltics (Estonia, Litvania, Latvia) including all assets,
liabilities, contracts and commercial relationships have been sold to the acquiring party, BaltCap.

   - Selecta SIA (Latvia)

   - Selecta UAB (Lithuania)

   - Selecta Easti (Estonia)

The disposal group was part of the region North. The effective date of the transaction was 14 March 2017.

The results of the transaction are as below:

The net disposal accounting gain recorded on the sale amounted to € 3.6 million.

**34. Assets and liabilities held for sale**

As an outcome of the antitrust clearance process conducted with the European Union Commission prior to
the acquisition of Pelican Rouge, the Group has been required to dispose Selecta Finland within six months after
the Pelican Rouge acquisition.

Consequently, the Group’s management is committed to a plan to sell Selecta Finland, including all assets,
liabilities, contracts and commercial relationships.

Accordingly, these Selecta Finland is presented as a disposal group held for sale in the consolidated
financial statements per 30 September 2017.

**35. Share based payments**

During the year ended 30 September 2014, the Group implemented a long term incentive plan for certain
key management personnel (the “Exit Bonus Plan” or “Plan”). Under the plan an exit payment will be paid to
those management personnel on the event of a change of control or a listing of the Group (the “exit event”). The
exit payment will be calculated as a percentage of the shareholders’ net equity proceeds, being the proceeds less
cost of investment, outstanding debt and certain debt like items, and costs incurred in connection with the change
of control or listing. No amounts were recognised in these consolidated financial statements as management does
consider unlikely the occurrence of any payment in consideration to this plan, which expires in June 2019.

**36. Commitments for expenditures**

**Operating lease commitments**

The Group leases various land and buildings, offices and vehicles under operating lease agreements. The
lease expenditure charged to the statement of profit or loss for the period is € 110.8 million, thereof minimum
lease payments € 44.4 million (2016: € 109.8 million and € 98.8 million respectively).

The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

**2017** **2016**
**€ (000’s)** **€ (000’s)**

**Total operating lease commitments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **111,220** **102,202**

€ 38.4 million (2016: € 38.3 million) of the total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable
operating leases relate to a building lease contracts held by the holding and trading company Selecta AG in
Switzerland. The most significant lease contracts have been signed for a period between 15 and 20 years.

**37. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets**

The Group, through a number of its subsidiaries, is involved in various legal proceedings or claims arising
from its normal business. Provisions are made as appropriate where management assesses that it is probable that

an outflow of economic benefits will arise. None of these proceedings results in a material contingent liability for
the Group.

**38. Related parties**

As a result of the Pelican Rouge acquisition, the controlling structure of the group has been changed: the
immediate parent of the Group is Selecta Midco S.à.r.l., a company incorporated in Luxembourg. The immediate

Since 11 December 2015, the ultimate controlling party of the Group are funds and accounts managed or
advised by affiliates of KKR & Co. L.P., which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:

Board of Selecta Group B.V. in their capacity as Members of the Supervisory Board or the Management Board

The ultimate controlling party of the Group changed when, on 11 December 2015, funds and accounts
managed or advised by affiliates of KKR & Co. L.P., which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE: KKR), acquired the shares of Selecta Group S.à.r.l., the Group’s immediate parent undertaking. KKR is
a leading global investment firm that manages investments across multiple asset classes including private equity,
energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds.

We entered into a contractual relationship with KKR Capstone regarding the provision of consulting
services. KKR Capstone, however, uses the name “KKR” under licence only and neither KKR & Co L.P. nor its
affiliates owns or controls KKR Capstone or KKR Capstone’s affiliates. Furthermore and for the avoidance of
doubt, the provision on consulting services by KKR Capstone have been entered into on arm’s length basis.

**39. Changes in scope of consolidations**

On 7 September 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of Pelican Rouge Group, through the acquisition
by Selecta AG of 100% ownership of Pelican Rouge Group B.V.

In the consolidated financial statements and all subsequent disclosure sections, Pelican Rouge’s
consolidated balance sheet is integrated as part of the balance sheet positions disclosed, whereas Pelican Rouge’s
consolidated statement of profit and loss is apportioned to the 24 days in September consolidated under the
Selecta Group, between the acquisition date and September 30, 2017.

The list of the acquired subsidiaries of the Pelican Rouge is presented in section 41.

Besides, during the year, the Group’s operating entities in the Baltics (Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia) including
all assets, liabilities, contracts and commercial relationships have been sold to the acquiring party, BaltCap, with
the effective date of the transfer of control on October 1, 2016 (see note 33).

**40. Events after the balance sheet date**

As a result of the Pelican Rouge group acquisition and the planned merger of the operations in certain
countries, the Group goodwill will be re-allocated to newly identified cash generating units (CGUs) of the
combined Group during the financial year ending 30 September 2018.

The key factor in the assessment conducted is the level at which operating results will be reviewed and
resource allocation decisions will be made. The Group is of the opinion that this is represented by the six new
regions of the combined Group, headed by a new regional leadership team, effective from October 2017 :

   - Region France: includes operating entities in France

   - Region Spain: includes operating entities in Spain

   - Region BENE: includes operating entities in Netherlands and Belgium

   - Region UK: includes operating entities in United Kingdom and Ireland

   - Region DACH: includes operating entities in Switzerland, Germany and Austria

   - Region North: includes operating entities located in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway

This regional organization reflects how the performance of the Group will be analysed, key management are
incentivised, and resources will be allocated within the Group.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**40. Events after the balance sheet date (Continued)**

Therefore, these six regions will represent the operating segments and cash generating units of the Group,
starting from October 2017.

The Group announced on 29 September 2017, that an entity controlled by KKR, Selecta’s majority
shareholder, has entered into an agreement to acquire Gruppo Argenta S.p.A. (“Argenta”), a leading vending and
coffee service provider in Italy, from Motion Equity Partners. Under the agreement and subject to certain
conditions, Selecta has the right to acquire Argenta directly from the seller in place of KKR, or after the
completion of the acquisition. A potential combination with Argenta is expected to strengthen Selecta’s position
as the pan-European industry leader with an enlarged presence in 16 countries.

To the best of management’s knowledge, no other events, other than those disclosed in these financial
statements, have occurred between 30 September 2017 and the date of authorization of these consolidated
financial statements (21 December 2017) that could have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

**Report of the Independent Auditor to the Board of Directors on the consolidated financial statements**

Report of the Independent Auditor to the Board of Directors of

**Selecta Group B.V., Amsterdam**

**Report of the Independent Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements**

As independent auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Selecta
Group B.V. from page 15 to page 67, which comprise the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of
profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in consolidated equity,
consolidated cash flow statement and notes to the consolidated financial statement for the year ended
30 September 2016.

**_Board of Directors’ Responsibility_**

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This responsibility includes designing,
implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The board of directors is
further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates
that are reasonable in the circumstances.

**_Auditor’s Responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free
from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal
control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our audit opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2016 give a true and
fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

**_Other Matter_**

This set of consolidated financial statements has voluntarily been prepared by the Board of Directors. Our
report thereon has been prepared at the request of the Board of Directors and does not represent a statutory
auditor’s report required in accordance with the laws and regulations in the Netherlands.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

There are no other new or amended standards or interpretations which have been published and become
effective on or after 1 October 2016 that are relevant to the Group’s operations.

The Group is currently reviewing its financial reporting for the new and amended standards which take
effect on or after 1 October 2016 and which the Group did not voluntarily adopt early.

**3.3. Basis of consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), see note 40. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or
has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting
policies into line with those used by other members of the Group and the IFRS.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

**Joint ventures**

A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the
net assets of the arrangement, rather than right to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. The Group’s
interests in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method. They are initially recognized at costs, which
includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the
Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, until the date
on which joint control ceases. The Group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets by the
Group to the joint venture that is attributable to the other joint venture partner. The Group does not recognise its
share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the Group’s purchase of assets from the joint
venture until it resells the assets to an independent party. However, a loss on the transaction is recognised
immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an
impairment loss.

**3.4. Business combinations**

Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the business
combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities are generally recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of
the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion
of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

**3.5. Foreign currencies**

**Foreign currencies in individual financial statements**

The functional currency of each group company is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial

position of each entity are translated in Euros (“EUR” or “€”), which is the presentation currency for the
consolidated financial statements. Euro is the currency that management uses when controlling and monitoring
the performance and financial position of the Group.

Transactions in currencies other than the group company’s functional currency (foreign currency
transactions) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date on which the transactions were entered
into, or a close approximation thereof. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are maintained at
the historical exchange rates and are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s
foreign operations are expressed in Euros using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and
expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as other comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s
currency translation reserve. Such exchange differences are reclassified from equity to statement of profit or loss
in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

The foreign currency rates applied against the Euro were as follows:

**3.6. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Maintenance and repair
costs are expensed as incurred.

The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Land Infinite (no depreciation is applied)
Buildings 40 to 60 years
Vending equipment 4 to 8 years
Vehicles 5 years
Machinery & Equipment 8 years
IT Hardware 3 to 5 years

Each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that is different from that
of the asset to which it belongs is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values and

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a
prospective basis.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same
basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in
the statement of profit or loss.

**3.7. Intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
subsidiary recognised at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. These cash-generating units are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication
that a unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the amount attributable to goodwill is included in the determination of the profit
or loss on disposal.

**Other intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill
where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their value can be measured reliably.

**Trademark**

The trademark recognised by the Group has an indefinite useful life and is not amortised. The trademark is
allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to the cash-generating units that are tested for impairment annually
as described in the section on Goodwill above.

**Customer contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life and are amortised over the useful life of 15 years.

**Software**

Software licences are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that they will generate future
economic benefits. They are amortised using the straight-line method over three-five years.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets and are amortised by the straight-line method
over three-five years when the following criteria are met:

   - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

F-163


-----

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

   - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

   - there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

   - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

   - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and

   - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures
that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously
recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Other software licences and software development costs are expensed as incurred. No intangible asset
arising from research (or from research phase of an internal project) is recognised. Expenditure on research (or
on the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense when it is incurred.

**3.8. Impairment of non-current assets other than goodwill or trademark**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its tangible and
intangible assets other than goodwill or trademark may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can
be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can
be identified.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the
asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the
statement of profit or loss.

**3.9. Prepayments and accrued income**

Prepayments and accrued income comprise payments made in advance relating to the following year, and
income relating to the current year, which will not be received until after the balance sheet date. Prepayments are
measured at the nominal amount of the payments. Accrued income is measured at amortised costs.

**3.10. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value corresponds to
the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less point-of-sales costs. A valuation allowance on
inventories is recorded, when the cost of inventories is greater than their net realisable value.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**3.11. Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers**

Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers include agreed discounts from suppliers’ list prices,
value and volume-related rebates. Income from value and volume-related rebates is recognised based on actual
purchases in the period as a proportion of total purchases made or forecast to be made over the rebate period.
Agreed discounts relating to inventories are credited to the statement of profit or loss as the goods are sold.
Rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the balance sheet date are deducted from their carrying
values so that the costs of inventories are recorded net of applicable rebates. Rebates received in respect of
property, plant and equipment are deducted from the costs capitalised.

**3.12. Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. An impairment loss on trade
receivables is recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts
due according to the original terms of the receivables. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference
between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s
original effective interest rate.

**3.13. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash
on hand, cash in points-of-sale, call deposits with banks, and other short-term, highly liquid financial assets with
original maturities of three months or less.

Due to the Group’s business model, significant cash balances are held at year-end on behalf of the Group by
external cash collecting firms, or en route to or from such cash counting firms. These amounts are included in
other current assets.

Bank overdrafts are included within current liabilities on the balance sheet.

**3.14. Assets held for sale**

Non current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held for sale if it is
highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the
remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets,
deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets or investment properties, which continue to be measured in
accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale
and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised
or depreciated, and equity accounted investments are no longer accounted for using equity accounting.

**3.15. Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability.

When some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be recovered from a third
party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that recovery will be received and the
amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**3.16. Loans due to parent undertaking / borrowings**

Loans due to parent undertaking or borrowings are recognised initially at fair value. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.

**3.17. Derivative financial instruments**

The Group uses from time to time derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and/or foreign exchange risk.

Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date, with changes therein generally recognised
in profit or loss (finance income or finance costs).

Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument and the economic
hedge created by the derivative financial statement is deemed to be effective, the changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The amount accumulated in
equity is retained in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods
during which the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.

In order to prove the effectiveness of the hedge the instrument is extensively documented at inception and
regularly tested to ensure that it remains effective. Where the hedge, or a portion of the hedge, is deemed not to
be effective, the change in fair value is recorded directly in finance income or finance costs in the statement of
profit or loss.

**3.18. Accruals and deferred income**

Accruals and deferred income comprise expenses relating to the current year, which will not be paid until
after the balance sheet date and cash received in advance, relating to the following year. Deferred income is
measured at the nominal value of the payments received less, if appropriate, cumulative amortisation in
accordance with IAS 18. Accruals are measured at amortised cost.

**3.19. Taxation**

The credit or charge for current income tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which
are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates of the countries where the Group has operations.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary
differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the
corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.

Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred
income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it can be reasonably expected that taxable profits will be
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities, which affects neither taxable nor accounting income.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Current income tax and deferred income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case it is
also recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists
to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same
taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

**3.20. Employee benefits**

The Group maintains various defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. The pension plans in
Switzerland have been set up on the basis of the Swiss method of defined contributions but as by law the Group
is committed to a much lower defined benefit pension plan, the whole contribution is as such treated.

Defined benefit obligations are largely covered through pension plan assets of pension funds that are legally
separated and independent from the Group. These are managed by a board of trustees consisting of
representatives of the employees and the employer. The organisation, management and financing of the pension
plans comply with the applicable pension regulations. Employees and pensioners or their survivors receive
statutorily determined benefits upon leaving the company or retiring as well as in the event of death or disability.
These benefits are financed through employer and employee contributions.

**Defined benefit plans**

In the case of defined benefits pension plans, the pension expenses and obligations are valued according to
the projected unit credit method. The corresponding calculations are carried out yearly by independent qualified
actuaries.

Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.

All re-measurement gains and losses on the net defined benefit liability are charged or credited in other
comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.

When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting past service cost is
generally recognised in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The Group recognises
gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.

**Defined contribution plans**

In the case of defined contribution pension plans, the Group has no further payment obligations once the
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an expense when the employees render the
corresponding service to the Group, which normally occurs in the same year in which the contributions are paid.
Payments made to state-managed plans are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the
Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution pension plan.

**3.21. Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, excluding trade discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.

**Sale of goods**

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered to the client site or when goods
are purchased from a machine by a customer, depending on the contract terms.

Revenue may be received directly in the form of cash from the consumer, or may be invoiced to a client
periodically.

F-167


-----

**Selecta Group B.V. and its subsidiaries, Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**3. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Where revenue is received in the form of cash, the amount recognised is the amount of cash received until
the last date on which the cash was collected from the machine, plus an estimate of the sales between this date
and the period end calculated based on historical trends.

Where the sale of goods is invoiced to the client, the amount recognised is based either on the amounts
delivered to the client or based on the consumption in the machines, depending on the specific contractual terms.
Where revenue is recognised based on consumption in the machines, the amount recognised is based on the last
recorded consumption from the machine plus an estimate of the sales between this date and the period end
calculated based on historical trends.

**Rendering of services**

Selecta also provides services to clients in the form of machine rentals, technical services and hygiene
services. Where the income is a fixed amount for the period the amount of revenue recognised is based on this
fixed amount. Where the income is dependent on the work performed, the revenue is recognised based on records
of technical site visits or other services provided.

**Interest income**

Income is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest rate that is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of
the financial asset.

**Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

**3.22. Leases**

The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment where the
Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are
capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present
value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between repayment of the outstanding
liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in
non-current liabilities or current liabilities as appropriate. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to
the statement of profit or loss over the lease period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance
leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Other lease agreements are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**3.23. Purchasing income**

The Group receives certain rebates from its suppliers in respect of the purchase of vending machines and
consumables. Where the rebates are received in respect of vending machines which are capitalised within
property, plant and equipment, the cost of those vending machines is reduced by the amount of the rebate
received. In relation to vending machines and consumables sold to customers and recognised within revenue, the
cost of goods sold and the cost of inventories are reduced by the amount of the rebate received.

**3.24. Finance costs**

Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and finance leases calculated using the effective
interest method, fair value losses on derivatives classified as held for trading and foreign exchange losses.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance income or finance expense
depending on whether the total foreign currency movements represent a gain or a loss accordingly.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4. Use of estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of
assets and liabilities in the next financial year are discussed below.

**Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives**

The carrying amounts of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated and which include
other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an
indication that they may be impaired. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on
their values in use. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with the most
up-to-date business plans that have been formally approved by management. The amounts and key assumptions
used for the value in use calculations are set out in notes 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Customer Contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life and are amortised over the determined life time of 15 years. The Group
actively monitors retention rates on customer contracts and considers other relevant factors which may provide
an indication of impairment. The amounts are described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Employee benefits**

The present value of the pension obligations depends on a variety of factors that are estimated annually
using a number of assumptions, including the discount rate to be applied to determine the present value of
defined benefit obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that
have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. The amounts and principal
assumptions used are described in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Deferred income tax assets**

Deferred income tax assets on unused tax losses carried forward are recognised when it is probable that
there will be future taxable profits against which the losses can be utilised. The assessment of recoverability of
the recognised deferred income tax assets is based on assumptions regarding future profits and is derived from
the latest budgets and business plans of the Group. The amounts are described in note 27 to the consolidated
financial statements.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is based on management’s best estimate of the consideration required
to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties
surrounding the obligation.

Provisions for warranties are ordinarily determined by product line and are based on statistics including the
likelihood of a break down occurring and the average cost of repair or replacement.

The amounts are described in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Sales estimations**

Where sales are based on consumption in the machines, there may be a timing difference between the date
on which the cash was last collected from the machines or the date on which the sales readings were taken. In

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**4. Use of estimates and key sources of estimation uncertainties (Continued)**

this case an estimate of the sales between the date of the last cash collection or the last machine reading and the
end of the period is made. The estimate is based on historical sales trends in respect of the specific client sites
and machines. The estimated amount of sales which have been neither collected in cash nor invoiced to
customers are recorded as Accrued income and uncollected cash in points-of-sale, as disclosed in Note 21.

**Inventories**

Inventories include perishable products which requires the Group to make estimates regarding the amount of
goods whose shelf life will expire before they are sold in order to determine the appropriate level of allowances
to be recorded. Such allowances are therefore calculated with reference to the level of inventories held, average
sales, and expiry dates.

Allowances for spare parts held in inventory are calculated according to the inventory turnover ratio.

Allowances for inventories are disclosed in Note 19.

**5. Segmental reporting**

The Group is organised and managed internally within four geographical regions. Each of these regions,
which are the operating segments of the Group, offers a similar portfolio of vending products and services to
consumers and customers. No operating segments have been aggregated. These segments represent the reportable
segments of the Group, as follows:

Region France: includes operating entities in France.

Region West: includes operating entities in UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium.

Region Central: included operating entities in Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Austria, Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Hungary until 30 September 2015. As of October 1, 2015 operating entities in Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Hungary were sold.

Region North: includes operating entities in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark and
Norway.

In addition to the segments identified above, the Group reports separately on its Headquarters (HQ), which
includes corporate centre functions in Switzerland and in the Netherlands.

The operating results, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), of each
reportable segment are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer, as the Group’s Chief Operating
Decision Maker, to assess performance and to determine how resources should be allocated.

**6. Revenue (Continued)**

Note that due to the nature of the Group’s business operations, whereby the sale of goods and rendering of
services are often incorporated into one contractual price, it is not possible to split revenue into these categories.
Therefore the Group has disclosed instead the allocation of revenue used for internal management reporting
purposes.

**15.1. Impairment testing**

During the financial year the carrying values of the cash-generating units, including goodwill, have been
compared to their recoverable amount. It has been concluded that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying
amounts and therefore no impairment is required to be booked.

**15.2. Allocation to cash-generating units**

For the purpose of impairment testing, the group identified four cash-generating units which are identical to
the Group’s operating segments, based on the regions in which the Group operates as follows:

Region France: includes operating entities in France.

Region West: includes operating entities in UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium.

Region Central: included operating entities in Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Austria, Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Hungary until 30 September 2015. As of October 1, 2015 operating entities in Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Hungary were sold.

Region North: includes operating entities in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark and
Norway.

The amount of goodwill allocated to each cash generating unit at 30 September 2016 and 2015 were as
follows:

**15.3. Summary of assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing**

In undertaking the impairment test, the Group has used post-tax cash flow projections for the computation
of value in use based on the latest forecasts approved by management covering a two-year period. In years three
to seven the Group assumes further growth of 3.0% (2015: 3.0%).

Cash flows beyond the seven-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates as disclosed in the
table below:

The average credit period on sales of goods is 30 days. No interest is charged on the trade receivables until
the end of the credit period, thereafter the charging of interest is at the discretion of local management depending
on the amounts and customers involved. Where interest is charged in respect of an overdue receivable the interest
rate applied is between 3% and 15% per annum depending on the country and the customer contract.

The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 360 days because historical experience indicates that
receivables that are past due beyond 360 days are not recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and 360
days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference
to past default experience.

Depending on the size of a potential new customer and the volume of trading expected, prior to accepting
new credit customers, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and
defines a suitable credit limit for the customer.

**20.1. Analysis of receivables past due but not impaired**

Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of € 8.7 million (2015:
€ 7.3 million) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for as there has not
been any significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does
not hold any collateral over these balances. The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

**30 September** **30 September**

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality
of the trade receivable at the reporting date. This is in most cases evidenced by the age of the receivable, and the
Group has implemented specific policies regarding the level of provision required for the change in credit quality
based on the ageing of the receivable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the fact that the Group has a very large customer base and a
mix of credit and cash sales. Accordingly, management believes that there is no further credit provision required
in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

**23.3. Details of borrowing facilities**

In June 2014 the Group issued a € 350 million 6.5% senior secured note (ISIN: XS1078234686,
XS1078234330) and a CHF 245 million 6.5% senior secured note (ISIN: XS1078234926, XS1078235147). The
notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are traded on the Euro MTF market.

In addition the Group’s parent undertaking, Selecta Group S.a.r.L. issued a PIK loan for € 220 million, the
proceeds of which have been loaned to the Group also in the form of a PIK loan (the “PIK proceeds loan”). The
PIK proceeds loan carries an interest rate of 11.875%.

In December 2015 Selecta Group S.a.r.L. granted an additional PIK loan with the same conditions to the
Group of € 5.6 million.

As part of the refinancing package the Group entered into a € 50 million super senior revolving credit
facility. The amount drawn under this facility at 30 September 2016 is € 29.0 million (30 September 2015: € 6
million). The interest rate on the super senior revolving credit facility is based on LIBOR plus 3.5%.

Under the terms of the Group’s super senior revolving credit facility, where more than 25% of the facility
has been drawn, a minimum net leverage ratio must be met before further drawings may be made under the
facility. The net leverage ratio represents the ratio of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the last twelve months
to Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt.

The Group has complied with the covenant obligation in the current and the previous year.

**24. Finance lease liabilities**

Finance leases relate predominantly to motor vehicles and vending equipment. The Group’s obligations
under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ title to the leased assets.

The present value of future minimum payments due under finance leases and the minimum lease payments

**25. Post-employment benefits**

**25.1. Defined contribution plans**

The Group operates defined contribution plans for qualifying employees in a number of its countries of
operation. The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group under the control of unrelated
parties.

Included in the Group’s current liabilities at the end of the year is an amount of € 157,000 (2015: € 41,000)
representing contributions due in respect of the reporting period but not yet paid over to the plans.

**25.2. Defined benefit plans**

**Description of plans**

The Group offers defined benefit plans in Switzerland, Germany and Spain as well as retirement indemnity
plans in France.

Approximately 96% of the defined benefit obligation and 100% of the plan assets relate to the Group’s
pension scheme in Switzerland. The scheme is part of the Valora Pension Fund, domiciled in Muttenz,
Switzerland and is governed by the rules of the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and
Disability Pension Plans (BVG), which specifies the minimum benefits that are to be provided by pension plans.
The scheme covers multiple employers, including Selecta, with the scheme assets allocated between Selecta and
the other companies in the scheme in proportion to the mathematical reserve and savings capital as at
30 September 2016. One employee of Selecta AG in Switzerland sits on the foundation board of the Valora
Pension Fund to ensure representation of Selecta in the wider scheme.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**25. Post-employment benefits (Continued)**

The designated purpose of the scheme is to protect the employees, including the employees’ dependents and
survivors, of the Valora Group of companies of Switzerland and the companies with which the scheme has
concluded an affiliation agreement against the economic consequences of old age, death and disability.

The benefits are defined in the pension plan regulations that are far above the minimum requirements
stipulated by the BVG. Retirement benefits are based on the accumulated retirement savings capital and can
either be drawn as a life-long pension or as a lump sum payment. The pension is upon retirement calculated by
multiplying the balance of the retirement savings capital with the applicable conversion rate. The retirement
savings capital results from the yearly savings contributions by both employer and employee until retirement and
carries interest thereon. The savings contributions are defined in the pension plan regulations. Minimum
contributions and minimum interest are defined by the BVG and the Federal Council respectively.

The scheme provides for a basic and supplementary plan. Under the basic plan, the wage portions above the
entry level for admission (equal to three quarters of the maximum retirement pension benefit prescribed by law)
are pensionable. The supplementary plan additionally offers coverage of wage portions that exceed the 5-fold
value of the maximum retirement pension benefit by more than CHF 5,000.

The scheme is subdivided into a risk pre-insurance and a primary insurance. The risk pre-insurance
coverage is a pure risk insurance that covers the risks of death and disability up to the age of 25. The primary
insurance begins at age 25 and is comprised of a savings facility run by the scheme and insurance covering the
death and disability risks.

The scheme participates in compulsory coverage and is entered in the register for occupational pension
providers as provided for by art. 48 of the Federal Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension
Plans Act (BVG/LPP). At minimum it provides for the benefits pursuant to BVG/LPP. The scheme is under the
regulatory supervision of the Canton of Basel Land.

**Amounts included in the consolidated financial statements**

**Defined benefit cost recognised in statement of profit or loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(5,795)** **(6,474)**

Past service credit/ (cost) and gains/ (losses) on settlements in the year ended 30 September 2016 relates to a
curtailment of the benefits payable under the Group’s pension in scheme in Switzerland. In January 2016 the
Valora pension scheme reduced the conversion rate for calculating the retirement pension, resulting in a
reduction of the future pensions to be paid and hence the defined benefit obligation of the scheme.

Past service credit/ (cost) and gains/ (losses) on settlements in the year ended 30 September 2015 relates to a
past service cost of € 55,000 on early retirement pension paid in the pension scheme in Switzerland.

**Sensitivity analysis**

The valuation of the pension benefit obligations is particularly sensitive with regard to changes to the
discount rate and the assumptions of the salary rises, pension rises and the expected mortality rate. The following
table shows the change of defined benefit obligation on the basis of a reasonably possible change to these
actuarial assumptions at 30 September 2016 and 2015:

**2016** **2015**
**€ (000’s)** **€ (000’s)**
Discount rate (+0.50%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11,332 12,820
Discount rate (-0.50%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (12,946) (14,436)
Increase in future salaries (+0.25%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (317) (625)
Decrease in future salaries (-0.25%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 331 604
Increase in future pension (+0.25%) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5,658) (5,735)
Decrease in future pension (-0.25%)* . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 18

- No decrease in future pension has been used for the sensitivity analysis on the pension scheme in Switzerland as the expected pension
increase assumed in the valuation is zero, and future pensions cannot be decreased.

Every sensitivity analysis considers the change of one assumption, while all other assumptions remain the
same. This approach shows the isolating effect if an individual assumption is changed, but does not consider that
some assumptions are mutually dependent.

The warranty provision represents management’s best estimate of the future outflow of economic benefits
that will be required in respect of warranties on machine sales and has been based on historical trends observed.

The provisions in respect of litigations and tax represent management’s best estimate of the future outflow
of economic benefits required to settle legal claims and tax claims made against the Group, and has been based
on advice from and discussion with the Group’s lawyers.

The restructuring provision represents amounts due to be paid in respect of certain restructuring activities
which have been initiated. The amounts provided include the costs of employee severance payments, as well as
other costs associated with closing facilities or offices.

These deferred income tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that future taxable profits
will be available to utilise the losses.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would
be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such amounts are currently regarded as
permanently reinvested. The parent is not only able to control the distribution of dividends but has also no plan
for any such distribution.

**30. Equity (Continued)**

Retained earnings include the accumulated net losses as well as the accumulated remeasurement gains and
losses on post-employment benefit obligations, including any related income taxes.

The hedging reserves comprise the effective portion of cumulative net change in the fair value of hedging
instruments used in cash flow hedges pending subsequent recognition in profit or loss as the hedged cash flows
affect profit or loss, included any related income taxes.

**31. Financial risk management**

**31.1. Risk management framework**

Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Board of Directors has
overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s financial policies. Group’s management
reports on a monthly basis to the Board of Directors on the Group’s performance. The Board of Directors meets
approximately 6 times a year and meeting minutes are documented. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is
responsible for setting financial strategies, which are executed by Group Treasury and by the Group’s
subsidiaries. The activities of Group Treasury and of the various subsidiaries are regularly reviewed and
monitored by the CFO thus verifying the compliance of operations within the approved guidelines and limits.

The Group Treasury function is responsible for ensuring adequate funds are available to the Group’s
subsidiaries as necessary. To this end a cash pool has been established in respect of some countries in which the
Group operates, and funds are reallocated across the Group as necessary. The Group’s Treasury function is also
responsible for drawing on and repaying amounts under the Group’s revolving credit facilities to meet the cash
needs of the Group. All drawings must be approved by the CFO and the outstanding borrowings under each
facility are reported to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.

**31.2. Market risk management**

Financial market risk is essentially caused by exposures to foreign currencies, interest rates and coffee price.
For further details on interest rate risk management see section 31.6 and foreign currency risk management see
section 31.7.

The Group is also exposed to commodity price risk because of coffee price fluctuations. Some of these
fluctuations can be passed on to clients through price increases in line with contractual conditions. The Group has
periodically assessed the economic impact of hedging the coffee prices but considers the hedging-cost as too high
to make hedging a commercially attractive measure. However whilst the Group does not enter into hedging
instruments into coffee prices, coffee volumes are committed with suppliers between 1 and 6 months in advance
depending on current green bean coffee prices and expectations of future price development.

**31.3. Credit risk management**

Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations as prescribed, resulting in a
financial loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk on its trade receivables, its non-current other
financial assets and its cash and cash equivalents.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure
to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**Carrying amount**
**Note** **2016** **2015**
**€ (000’s)** **€ (000’s)**

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31. Financial risk management (Continued)**

Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and ongoing credit evaluation in all the subsidiaries. Due to its
large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit
risk on its trade receivables, and there were no counterparties where credit risk exceeded 5% of gross monetary
assets at any time during the year. In addition, due to the nature of the Group’s operations, a significant portion
of its revenues are received in cash.

For details on how the Group manages its credit risk arising from trade receivables see note 20.

The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents (€ 66.8m, 2015 € 36.2m)
as these are spread over several institutions in different geographic areas.

Settlement risk results from the fact that the Group may not receive financial instruments from its
counterparties at the expected time. This risk is managed by monitoring counterparty activity and settlement
limits.

**31.4. Liquidity risk management**

Liquidity risk arises when a company encounters difficulties to meet commitments associated with financial
instruments. Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. This risk
is managed by limiting exposures in instruments that may be affected by liquidity problems and by actively
matching the funding horizon of debt with incoming cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring
adequate reserves are available, and through its banking facilities, in particular the Group’s revolving credit
facilities. In addition, the Group continuously monitors cash flows to ensure that adequate funds exist to settle its
liabilities.

The Group has several benchmarks and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for
using derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency
without the approval of the CFO. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency exposures without
the approval of the CFO. Wherever possible, the Group requires that subsidiaries repatriate all their excess cash
and bank balances to Group finance companies to allow the Group to ensure that adequate funds are made
available across the Group as necessary.

**Liquidity available through financing facilities**

As part of the refinancing of the Group in the year ended 30 September 2014 the Group has entered into a
€ 50 million super senior revolving credit facility. The amount drawn under this facility at 30 September 2016 is
€ 29.0 million (2015: € 6.0 million) and therefore € 21.0 million remains available.

**31.5. Capital management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as disclosed in note 23 offset by cash and
bank balances) and equity of the Group (comprising share capital, share premium, additional paid in capital,
currency translation reserves, hedging reserves and retained earnings).

**31.6. Interest rate risk management**

Interest rate risk comprises the cash flow risk that results from changes in interest rates. The Group’s
secured loan notes and notes due to parent undertakings carry interest at fixed rates. As these loans form the
significant part of the Group’s borrowings the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is relatively limited. Interest
on the Group’s revolving credit facility is linked to LIBOR, however the amounts involved are relatively limited
in comparison to the overall borrowings, and at 30 September 2016 € 29.0 million were outstanding on this
facility (2015: € 6.0 million).

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**

**31. Financial risk management (Continued)**

The interest rate on the Group’s secured loan notes amounts to 6.5%, on the loans due to parent
undertakings to 11.875%, and on the Group’s revolving credit facility to LIBOR plus 3.5%. The remaining
contractual maturity in respect of the Group’s borrowings is disclosed in Note 31.4.

The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments are as follows:

**30 September** **30 September**
**2016** **2015**

**Total variable-rate instruments** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **33,558** **25,740**

**Interest rate risk sensitivity**

The sensitivity is based on the Group’s total variable rate instruments at 30 September, assuming the
amount of the liabilities outstanding and the financial assets held at the end of the reporting period was
outstanding for the whole year.

At 30 September 2016, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower, with all other assumptions
held constant and the outstanding liabilities as well as held assets assumed constant for the whole year, profit
after taxation would decrease/increase by € 0.3 million (€ 0.3 million respectively in financial year ended
30 September 2015).

A 100 basis points change is used for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis as it represents management’s
assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.

**31.7. Foreign currency risk management**

Foreign currency transaction risk arises because subsidiaries sometimes undertake transactions in foreign
currencies such as the import of machines and the acquisition of services and the related borrowings. Translation
exposure arises from the consolidation of the Group accounts into € and is not hedged but managed primarily
through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.

In order to minimise the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Group has entered into cross
currency swaps in the year ended 30 September 2014, and renewed the existing cross currency swaps in June
2016 for another year, in order to hedge against the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s interest
payments (see note 32.3).

**Exposure to currency risk**

Since each of the Group’s subsidiaries invoices its customers in its functional and since the significant part

**31. Financial risk management (Continued)**

Certain of the holding companies based in Switzerland, and therefore with Swiss Francs as their functional
currency, have loan receivables and payables, both with external parties and with other Group companies,
denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. The table below shows the total net financial
assets / (liabilities) which are exposed to currency risk, by currency, arising in those entities:

**2016** **2015**
**Currency (000’s)** **Currency (000’s)**
EUR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 105,865 76,742

**Foreign currency sensitivity**

Most Group companies transact the majority of their business in their functional currency. For Selecta
Group, transaction risks arise as a result of financing based on another currency than the functional currency of
the respective group company. The transaction risks analysis has been performed to include variations in the
exchange rate between CHF, GBP and SEK against EUR as those three currencies represent major currencies
other than the functional currency of the respective group company. The Group’s sensitivity analysis has been
determined based on the Group’s net transaction exposure as at the end of the reporting period. A ±10 percent
change is used for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis as it represents management’s assessment of a
reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

At 30 September 2016 a ±10 percent change in the CHF, GBP and SEK against EUR would impact the net
profit and the equity of the Group according to the table below. The amounts below show the increase in net
profit and equity which would come about as a result of a 10% strengthening of the EUR against each of the
currencies below. For a 10% weakening of the EUR against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable
decrease in net profit and equity.

**32.2. Measurement of fair values**

The following table shows the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 fair values:

**Financial instruments measured at fair value**


**Valuation technique**

Cross currency swaps used for hedging Periodic mid-market values are based on
observable inputs including foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates.
A credit spread is added to the standard,
risk-free discount curve, determined by
comparing the composite yield of a basket
of fixed-rate bonds issued by entities with
similar credit characteristics to the
Company, to the risk-free rate.

**32.3. Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges**

The Group holds certain cross currency swaps in order to hedge against the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on the Group’s interest payments and borrowings. Part of the cross currency swaps entered into in
June 2014 have been designated as cash flow hedges to the extent that they represent an effective accounting
hedge. These hedging instruments have been terminated in May 2016 and therefore hedge accounting was
discontinued prospectively. The remaining hedge reserve of the terminated hedging instruments will be fully
reclassified from equity to profit and loss when the original exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s interest
payments and borrowings impact profit or loss. No hedge accounting is applied to the new cross currency swaps
the Group entered into in the renewal transactions in the reporting period.

At 30 September 2015 the derivative financial instruments had a negative fair value of net € 10.6 million. In
the year ended 30 September 2016 the positive change in fair value of the derivative financial instruments which
was recorded in other comprehensive income was € 1.3 million (2015: negative change of € 2.5 million).

The following table shows the original trade date, maturity date, notional amounts and carrying amount of
the cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges:

**Original trade** **Notional** **Carrying**

agreements under which, in the event of a default, the amounts owed by each counterparty at any given point in
time are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other.

**34. Share based payments**

During the year ended 30 September 2014, the Group implemented a new long term incentive plan for
certain key management personnel (the “Exit Bonus Plan” or “Plan”). Under the plan an exit payment will be
paid to those management personnel on the event of a change of control or a listing of the Group (the “exit
event”). The exit payment will be calculated as a percentage of the shareholders’ net equity proceeds, being the
proceeds less cost of investment, outstanding debt and certain debt like items, and costs incurred in connection
with the change of control or listing. No amounts were recognised in these consolidated financial statements as
management does consider unlikely the occurrence of any payment in consideration to this plan, which expires in
June 2019.

**37.3. Transactions and balances with related parties**

The ultimate controlling party of the Group changed when, on 11 December 2015, funds and accounts
managed or advised by affiliates of KKR & Co. L.P., which is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE: KKR), acquired the shares of Selecta Group S.à.r.l., the Group’s immediate parent undertaking. KKR is
a leading global investment firm that manages investments across multiple asset classes including private equity,
energy, infrastructure, real estate, credit and hedge funds.

As part of our business, we have entered into certain transactions with affiliates of KKR. These relate to the
provision of vending services and have been entered into on an arm’s length basis.

We have further entered into a contractual relationship with KKR Capstone regarding the provision of
consulting services. KKR Capstone, however, uses the name “KKR” under licence only and neither KKR & Co
L.P. nor its affiliates owns or controls KKR Capstone or KKR Capstone’s affiliates. Furthermore and for the
avoidance of doubt, the provision on consulting services by KKR Capstone have been entered into on arm’s
length basis.
