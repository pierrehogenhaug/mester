Some of the limitations of non-GAAP measures are that: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA-based measures reflect cash payments that were made, or may be made in the future; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.7,Non-GAAP Financial Information,4.7.2,Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information,"We also present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited non-GAAP aggregated financial information (the “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”) on a constant scope and constant currency basis for the relevant periods. The results of operation for each of the Pelican Rouge Group, the Argenta Group and the Express Vending Group are represented in our Historical Financial Statements only as of the respective date of each of their acquisition. As a result, our Historical Financial Statements are not directly comparable with each other for each of the relevant periods. We also completed a number of disposals between 2016 and 2018, which also affect the comparability of our financial results between periods. We believe that presenting the Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information is useful to investors in evaluating our financial performance as we believe this information will aid comparability of our results of operations. The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any generally accepted accounting standards nor with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, or any other regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission, or any other regulator. The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been derived by applying adjustments to our Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, which adjustments are not recognized by IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been derived by applying certain adjustments to each of our Historical Financial Statements and the financial statements of the Pelican Rouge Group, the Argenta Group and the Express Vending Group for the relevant periods. Such adjustments fall within two categories, adjusting for the scope of the financial information included (constant scope adjustments) and the exchange rates used in respect of the financial information recorded in currencies other than euro (constant currency adjustments), as described in detail below. _Constant Scope Adjustments_ The Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been adjusted to give effect to the transactions described below, as if they had occurred on October 1, 2015, to the extent they were not already reflected in the relevant period: - the acquisition by Selecta AG of the Pelican Rouge Group, which occurred on September 7, 2017, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 6, 2017; - the acquisition by TopCo of the Argenta Group, which occurred on February 2, 2018, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to February 1, 2018; xiii ----- - the acquisition by Selecta AG of the Express Vending Group, which occurred on August 17, 2018, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to August 16, 2018; - the disposal of Pelican Rouge subsidiaries in Sweden, which occurred in March 2016, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in March 2016; - the disposal of Pelican Rouge subsidiaries in Germany, which occurred in March 2016, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to the date of disposal in March 2016; - the disposal of Selecta subsidiaries in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which occurred in March 2017, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016; - the disposal of a Selecta subsidiary in Finland, which occurred in March 2018, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2017; and - the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which occurred on September 19, 2018, and contributes to the adjustments for the period from October 1, 2015, to September 18, 2018. While the Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information has been adjusted to reflect acquisitions that we consider significant, it does not reflect all acquisitions we have completed during the relevant period. We categorize acquisitions of businesses with less than €3.0 million in gross sales for the twelve months preceding such acquisition as part of our organic growth. Consequently, transactions involving such acquisitions are not included in the constant scope adjustments to our Historical Financial Statements. In addition to the above, adjustments are made as a result of accounting policy differences and reclassifications, as further detailed under “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information—Adjusted _Revenue (CS & CC) and Adjusted Net Revenue (CS & CC)” and “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information—Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC).” Constant Currency Adjustments_ We are a geographically diversified business with operations in 16 countries across Europe and accordingly we undertake transactions in various currencies. Many of our subsidiaries report their financial results in currencies other than the euro, the reporting currency used in our Historical Financial Statements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and _Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk.” To enhance the comparability of our_ financial results, such results are presented using a constant exchange rate across all periods presented. Measures calculated using constant exchange rates are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. The exchange rates used for the calculation of constant exchange rate measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have been derived from the European Central Bank as of September 29, 2017, which constitute our budget exchange rates for the financial years ended September 30, 2018 and 2019, as set out in the following table:",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

226_2,Offerings 2019.md,5,INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA,5.1,,5.1.1,,"This Offering Memorandum contains statistics, data and other information regarding markets, market sizes, market shares, market positions, growth rates and other industry data pertaining to the Group’s business and markets. Unless otherwise indicated, such information is based on the Issuer’s analysis of multiple sources, and the industry and market data. Such information has been accurately reproduced and, as far as the Issuer is aware from such information, no facts have been omitted which would render the information provided inaccurate or misleading. In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the market in which we operate and compete. Certain market data and economic and industry data and forecasts used in this Offering Memorandum were obtained from governmental and other publicly available information, independent industry publications and reports prepared by industry consultants. These include information extracted without material adjustment from a commissioned report published by OC&C Strategy Consultants (“OC&C”). The OC&C Report has been produced based on publications comprising industry data, forecasts, surveys and other information made available to OC&C by third-party data providers. Some of the data in those publications are based on estimates in respect of our business whereas OC&C have been provided with actual data by us. The OC&C Report is therefore based on a combination of third-party sources, adjusted where appropriate to reflect actual data. As such, the data, statistics and analysis provided by OC&C may differ from the data, statistics and analysis contained in other industry publications. OC&C’s views on markets and their competitive environment are derived from a broad range of sources, and include market projections based on estimated historic growth rates, the projection of known factors which have driven historic market growth and their projected future evolution. There is an inherent degree of uncertainty in these projections; they are estimates and should be treated as such. In addition, we have also included information regarding the market in which we operate, which is based on internal data, management’s estimates, and other sources. In considering the industry and market data included in this Offering Memorandum, prospective investors should note that such information may be subject to significant uncertainty due to differing definitions of the relevant markets and market segments described. In many cases, there is no readily available external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to independently verify our market related analyses and estimates, thus requiring us to rely on internally developed data. Consequently, we have made certain estimates largely based on internal surveys and studies. In the absence of such information, we have made statements regarding our industry and market share based on our experience, our own investigation of market conditions and our management’s best estimates. When discussing market share for the year ended December 31, 2017, the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” include for such purpose the market share of Argenta, even though the Argenta Acquisition was not completed until February 2, 2018. While we believe our estimates to be reasonable, they have not been verified by any independent sources and we cannot assure you that any of our assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry. Neither we nor any of the Managers make any representation as to the accuracy of such information.

We held the number one or number two market position based on revenue in 2017 in our ten core markets of Belgium, France, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We served over ten million consumers per day via more than 3,800 routes as of June 30, 2019. We operate in a highly fragmented market, which provides growth opportunities, both organically and through accretive acquisitions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we generated a revenue of €1,580.8 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €267.7 million, and we would have generated an Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,604.7 million and an Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) of €271.2 million, achieving 3.8% Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, and 18.9% Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margins. The following map illustrates the countries in which we operate, our geographical segments as of June 30, 2019, and our market positions in the Focus Countries (as defined below) for the year ended December 30, 2017. _Source: OC&C. Market data as of 2017. Our market share in Italy consists of the 2017 market share of Argenta, which we acquired in February 2018. Our market share in the UK consists of the 2017 market share of Selecta combined with (i) the 2017 market share of the UK operations of Pelican Rouge, which we acquired in September 2017, and (ii) the 2017 market share of Express Vending, which we acquired in August 2018._ Our diversified product offering includes both coffee and hot drinks, and we have entered into strong partnerships with global premium coffee brands such as Starbucks and Lavazza, which allow us to benefit from consumers’ increasing preference for premium products, especially coffee, and result in higher margins. We also cater to the impulse-based consumer purchases with offerings of snacks, including healthy options, cold drinks and fresh food sold through traditional impulse PoS as well as our recently introduced MicroMarkets concept. 1 ----- For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) as a percentage of the types of items we sell amounted to 56% for coffee and hot drinks, 29% for impulse items, and 15% for other. We serve customers and generate revenue in the workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business channels further discussed below: (*) Adjusted Revenue (CS & CS) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Our business model covers the full value chain of the coffee and convenience food Unattended SSR Market, from green bean roasting to brewing to the consumer’s cup, and we have developed industry leading coffee know-how, capabilities, and expertise in connection with these processes. We roast and produce both instant and full bean coffee, which we use in our own PoS, our customers’ PoS and also sell to third parties, and as such, our roaster in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, is an important driver of our coffee expertise. We have created a strong portfolio of high-quality coffee brands, such as our in-house developed Pelican Rouge brand and its craftsmanship image that caters for growing number of consumers increasingly looking for this attribute. Our Pelican Rouge brand complements our premium coffee offering in partnership with Lavazza and Starbucks. We leverage our technology capabilities and data collection from PoS to provide relevant products, gauge consumer preferences and maximize revenue opportunities, which improve consumer experience and customer satisfaction. We also provide cleaning, maintenance, and technical support services which can be customized based on individual customer needs and preferences, even when we do not enter into a full self-service retail service arrangement with the customer. In addition to our unattended self-service and coffee roasting operations, we also sell coffee and machines, including to hotels, restaurants and cafés, and machine parts and products independent of self-service retail service arrangements. Due to the predictable nature of our business and the length of our customer contracts, we believe we are able to achieve high revenue visibility. We benefit from diversified revenue streams secured by multi-year contracts derived from a large and loyal customer base across private and public sector in 2018 and a 100% retention rate with our top ten customers over that period. As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that our average private customer contract term is three to five years, and our average public customer contract term is five to ten years. Moreover, the maintenance and cleaning services we offer as part of our self-service retail services provide us with an additional source of high margin revenues. Innovation and technology are also key drivers of our success, and we benefit from our track record of innovation leadership both in terms of technology upgrades such as cashless payment, touchscreen user interfaces and telemetry, as well as in terms of unattended self-service retail concepts, such as MicroMarkets, to drive daily revenue per PoS and open new routes-to-market. 2 ----- Since our founding in Switzerland in 1957, we have grown organically as well as through acquisitions. On September 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the Pelican Rouge Group, which increased our presence in nine of the 15 markets in which we operated at that time, making us the market leader by revenue in France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. In addition, on February 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of the Argenta Group, a leading unattended self-service retail operator in Italy, which became our 16[th] market. On August 17, 2018, we acquired Express Vending, a leading UK supplier of premium unattended self-service retail services, bolstering our position as the leading European provider of route-based unattended self-service coffee and impulse and convenience food offerings, including MicroMarkets, and further consolidated our leading position in the United Kingdom. Express Vending is at the forefront of MicroMarket design and deployment in the UK. Express Vending’s Express HUB brand stores, with open plan refreshment areas, an extensive product range and self-scan kiosks. As a result of these acquisitions, our innovation and technology leadership, and through upgrades of our business, operating systems and corporate culture, we have achieved a leading position in Europe as a routebased unattended self-service retail provider with strong know-how and capabilities in providing coffee and impulse offerings across a range of workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business channels. We had average market shares ranging between 10% and 15% in our core markets for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to approximately 6% of the European market over the same period in 2016, and we served over ten million consumers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 6 million for the year ended September 30, 2016. We see significant opportunities for further organic growth and accretive acquisition-led growth in our highly fragmented markets.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,Business Proposition Offering Unmatched Convenience,"We offer consumers a wide variety of on-the-go food products for everyday consumption and impulse purchases, with a strong focus on coffee, at all hours of the day and every day of the year thanks to our unattended, 24/7, fully automated, convenience retail concept. Our concept targets captive environments and is economically viable even in low footfall locations due to our minimal operational costs compared with traditional retail concepts. Our ability to sell products in convenient retail locations and our high level of customer service has led to an average overall customer retention based on revenue of approximately 95.9% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and approximately 92.5% and 94.4% for each of the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2018, respectively. We believe that the quality of our service levels and our customer relationship management contribute to customer loyalty, leading to an average relationship of approximately 15 years with our 10 largest customers. In addition, contract renewals with our existing long-term customers are typically more profitable than entering into a contract with a new customer, due to savings on equipment and other capital expenditures and customer acquisition costs. Our costs associated with new customers are followed by predictable revenue streams and we usually recoup these costs within two years. We have a scalable routebased business model that we are able to apply across the 16 countries in which we operate with the same key success factors, to drive growth in customers, daily revenue per PoS and profitability. For example, following the Argenta Acquisition in 2018, we have replicated Argenta’s MicroMarkets operating model in other countries such as Switzerland and the Netherlands. Our focus on out-of-home impulse consumption limits our exposure to competition from online retailers and offerings.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Well Positioned to Take Advantage of Premium Coffee and Out-of-Home Consumption Growth,"We operate in the convenience food and beverage market, estimated at €42 billion in 2017 (our “Addressable Market”) in our focus countries of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom (the “Focus Countries”). Within the Addressable Market, we focus on the Unattended SSR Market which has a market size of approximately €16 billion in our 16 countries of operations, of which approximately €15 billion arises in the Focus Countries. Our Addressable Market has grown at a CAGR of 2.1% between 2012 and 2017, reaching a total value of approximately €40.5 billion in the Focus Countries and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% reaching €47.1 billion by 2022. This trend has been driven by a positive macro-economic backdrop with an increase in GDP and stable employment levels, which have led to increased spending in the workplace channel. In addition, we believe that an increasing preference for drinking premium coffee and out-of-home consumption, increased mobility, and the desire for easy availability of healthy and quality products is driving consumers towards our pan-European on-the-go self-service retail offerings. For 3 ----- example, sales of coffee within the Addressable Market has grown at a CAGR of 2.8% between 2012 to 2017, reaching €16.0 billion, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.9%, reaching €19.4 billion by 2022. Moreover, the growing trend toward premium brands has created a shift in consumer emphasis on high quality product offerings, including organic and name-brand coffee, a trend which we are addressing with our Starbucks, and Lavazza brand partnerships. For example, we are able to offer consumers a premium hot drinks experience, both in the workplace and on-the-go through our long-standing partnership with Starbucks. As of June 30, 2019, we have installed approximately 1,964 Starbucks concepts across Europe, and the price of a coffee sold in our Starbucks on-the-go concept is between 20% to 90% higher than a coffee sold in traditional self-service PoS, and such trends for premium brands support our profitability. Similarly, through our partnership with Lavazza we offer our customers and consumers additional options for a premium coffee experience. As of June 30, 2019, we had over 15,637 PoS selling Lavazza coffee and we estimate that approximately 40,000 PoS will serve Lavazza coffee in the long-term.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Leading Unattended Self-Service Coffee and Convenience Food Provider in the European Unattended SSR Market with Growth above Market,"We are the leading route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider in the Unattended SSR Market, and had an estimated 10% market share by revenue in the Focus Countries for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to 6% over the same period in 2016. We believe that our adjusted revenue (on a constant scope and constant currency basis) for the year ended September 30, 2018, was approximately 3.5 times that of the second largest market player. As of June 30, 2019, we had operations in 16 European countries, which covered approximately 95% of European GDP and contain approximately 78% of the European population. In 2016, we served over six million consumers per day, which we have nearly doubled to more than ten million consumers served per day. We held the number one or number two market position based on revenue in 2017 in our ten core markets, and we estimate that this market data is still accurate as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Our sales in these markets represented 90.7% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, we operated a network of more than 475,000 active coffee and convenience food and beverage self-service PoS, approximately 2.5 times the number of PoS of the second largest market player. With regards to our suppliers, we believe we are the largest machine buyer in the highly fragmented Unattended SSR Market, making us the customer of choice for our suppliers, which in turn provides us with competitively priced procurement arrangements on, amongst other, a wide selection of market leading machines. The Unattended SSR Market is characterized by fragmentation and intense competition on a local level. We are one of the very few operators on a pan-European level, which increases the appeal of our brands and offerings with consumers and of our services and concepts with customers, as compared with our smaller competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in each of our three geographic segments was split relatively evenly with Central accounting for 37%, North accounting for 26%, and South, UK & Ireland accounting for 37%. This is in contrast to the second largest market player, over three quarters of whose revenue in its last financial year was derived from Italy alone. In addition, the breadth of our product portfolio enables us to better address consumers’ preferences across geographic segments, including evolving market trends, and to provide a one-stop shop offering for our customers. Additionally, our established brands and unique concepts differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to secure attractive and comprehensive contracts with a variety of suppliers and premium brands, which help us maintain our high market share.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.4,Using Innovation and Technology to Drive Growth and Improve Margins,"We use innovation and new technologies to drive our growth and improve margins, and we have a track record of innovation leadership through continuous rollouts of upgrades to our PoS across all geographies. Innovation and technology improve the consumer experience, enhance operational excellence and allow us to further expand our route-based business model. Cashless payment systems and digital touchscreen user interfaces that we are rolling out across our PoS park enhance the consumer experience by providing additional accessibility and simplicity of use, thereby driving number of sales and average transaction size compared to cash transactions. As of June 30, 2019, daily revenue per PoS equipped with cashless technology are on average 10% to 20% higher than PoS that only accept cash, and the average transaction value of products sold from cashless PoS is between 5% to 10% higher, making cashless payment options an important driver in increasing sales from existing PoS. As of June 30, 2019, 95% of our public PoS deployed cashless technology. Telemetry in our PoS allows us to better adjust our pricing and product offerings to drive sales and to more efficiently monitor 4 ----- inventory levels and determine maintenance requirements, which increases our route efficiency and operational excellence, and thereby improves service quality and customer retention. As of June 30, 2019, we had telemetry devices installed in approximately 95% of our public PoS. In addition to technological innovation, we also continue to innovate and introduce new unattended self-service retail concepts, such as MicroMarkets, to adapt to market and consumer trends, increase sales and improve profitability, while reducing capital expenditures.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.5,Route-Based Business Model with High Density on the Last Mile,"Our route-based business model combined with our size represents a distinct competitive advantage, particularly on the last mile of service, which allows us to service and supply PoS at an optimized cost level, thereby improving our profitability compared to other competitors. In addition, we continuously optimize the density of our PoS to make routes more efficient, thereby reducing driving time and increasing our ability to service more PoS per hour and more PoS per FTE. We are, therefore, able to offer more competitive pricing at the same profitability point or the same levels of service at a lower price, as compared to less profitable smaller regional players, thereby creating genuine barriers to match our scale. We also use data from our PoS equipped with telemetry and our dedicated team of approximately 150 planners (as of June 30, 2019) to continuously optimize our over 3,800 dense and cost-effective routes. As of June 30, 2019, our 4,900 route merchandizers and 1,400 route technicians were able to service their routes using a fleet of over 5,000 vehicles. The map below illustrates the location of each of our PoS, and shows the density of our route-based networks.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.6,Scale Driven Business Model Creating Attractive Economics and Enhancing Established Market Presence,"We have developed a business model with a cost advantage through economies of scale and high density, and we believe it will be difficult for potential competitors to replicate the scale, breadth, and efficiency of our organization. Our scale also enables us to deliver superior customer service by leveraging our knowledge of the industry to provide customers and consumers with a comprehensive range of products and innovative service offerings. These attributes lead to an estimated 5% to 15% EBITDA margin (as defined by and according to OC&C) advantage over smaller competitors. We deploy capital expenditures in order to retain and acquire new customers and do so by acquiring new PoS and refurbishing our existing PoS in order to enhance returns on investment. Capital expenditure for new PoS and refurbishment of existing PoS of the Group typically achieves a ROI ranging from 100% to 250%, depending on the country, with the highest returns in the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland. We have consistently achieved efficiencies stemming from PoS park rationalization (which includes margin management, relocating PoS to more profitable locations, and decreasing the types of PoS in use) and refurbishment. In addition to the operational advantages explained above we also believe that given our scale we retain a cost advantage over our competitors in terms of pricing from machine suppliers and that our in-house refurbishment and maintenance capabilities also provide us a cost advantage. 5 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Adjusted EBITDA minus net capital expenditures, divided by Adjusted EBITDA, amounted to 38.2%, 42.5% and 50.8% for the years ended September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 49.0% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Following the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition, and the Express Vending Acquisition, we have also benefited from significant cost synergies including, among others, procurement savings, footprint optimization, headquarters integration, and price harmonization and streamlining. As we continue to realize synergies, our efficiency improves and cash conversion continues on a positive trend. Our strong market positions in key markets, coupled with our ongoing efforts to optimize PoS density and operational efficiencies, increased technology penetration, as well as data analytics across all markets contribute to further enhancing our financial profile and organic growth. Excluding France and the UK, we achieved revenue growth of 4.3% for the year ended September 30, 2018, compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, and 5.2% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, while achieving organic revenue growth at constant scope and constant currency (as further described under “Unaudited Non-GAAP Aggregated Financial Information”) of 3.4% and 2.7% during the same respective periods. Additionally, through our continued efforts to install new and upgrade existing PoS as well as optimize our product offering, we have seen a growth of 1.4% in our daily revenue per PoS in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Density optimization is also a key consideration in our bolt-on acquisition program, and one of the key drivers of synergy achievement. Our operational excellence is also driven by our success in acquiring and integrating companies, such as Pelican Rouge, Argenta and Express Vending. Led by an integration office reporting to the Board of Directors of the Group, we have identified approximately €75 million in annualized procurement, SG&A and operational synergies that are at being implemented and that we expect to be fully realized by the end of 2020, resulting in a strong margin uplift. In terms of procurement, we expect to achieve up to €30 million of annualized synergies from equipment, ingredients, bought-in goods, disposables, packaging and spares and the in-sourcing of coffee production. SG&A synergies in an amount of up to €13 million include the consolidation of country and group headquarters and the optimization of overhead and corporate costs.

Firstly, we are expanding and upgrading our current PoS base with telemetry technology, a remote PoS monitoring allowing for optimization of cost-to-serve and product availability while leading the transformation toward an end-to-end operating model. Approximately 29% of our eligible PoS park has already been upgraded as of June 30, 2019, while we aim to roll-out telemetry to all eligible PoS across the footprint. Secondly, we are also upgrading our PoS to support cashless technology to enhance check-out experience at the point of sale by providing access to non-cash payment methods, i.e. credit cards and proprietary apps. Approximately 20% of our eligible PoS park has already been upgraded as of June 30, 2019.

In total, we expect to realize approximately €75 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies from these acquisitions by the end of 2020. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have realized approximately €52 million of these cost synergies, which represents 69% of our total expected cost synergies. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition)” and “Forward-Looking Statements.” Our total estimated cost synergies include the following:_ - Operating cost savings relating to logistics and footprint optimizations of approximately €33 million, of which we had realized €18 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized by (i) combining operations in areas with fewer PoS to reduce the number of employees required to maintain and refill these PoS, (ii) implementing Selecta’s refiller planning program, which is based on actual sales of each PoS rather than a theoretical model, (iii) cost savings by increasing the use of telemetry for PoS in France, Spain and the UK (iv) headcount reductions following the assessment of productivity of our technicians and through the integration of corporate, IT and other central functions, (v) footprint optimization by concentrating warehouses in the countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate, and (vi) logistics network synergies, including planning denser and more cost-effective routes. - Procurement savings of approximately €30 million, of which we had realized €22 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized by (i) obtaining better prices on ingredients through in-sourcing of our own brand coffee from Pelican Rouge’s roaster facility and international tender of raw materials used across the countries in which we operate, such as sugar, (ii) harmonizing prices of products we purchase for our PoS (such as snacks or cold drinks) by leveraging our scale and negotiating prices through strategic relationships at the Group level, (iii) savings on disposables, such as cups for our PoS, and packaging through leveraging our increased purchasing volume at the Group level, (iv) streamlining purchases of spare parts for our machines, (v) indirect cost savings on our fleet, IT, marketing, and warehouses, and (vi) real estate savings as a result of terminating redundant leases and renegotiating existing leases. - Selling, general, and administrative cost savings of approximately €13 million, of which we had realized €12 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized through (i) headcount reductions as a result of integrating management teams in countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate and re-sizing our sales force, (ii) savings in connection with headcount reductions in the research and development department of the Group by leveraging Argenta’s research and development expertise, (iii) reductions in employee benefit expenses, such as cars, travel, and mobile phones, in connection with headcount reductions, (iv) combining headquarters in countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate, and (v) additional productivity gains in sales, general and administrative costs. As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have incurred approximately €25 million in costs and capital expenditures to implement the foregoing synergies, and estimate that we will incur approximately €28 million in further costs and capital expenditures to 25 ----- realize our total targeted cost synergies. In particular, we expect to incur (i) total estimated severance costs of approximately €24 million, of which approximately €10 million have already been incurred as of June 30, 2019, and (ii) estimated integration costs of approximately €29 million, of which approximately €14 million have already been incurred as of June 30, 2019. Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected synergies reflected above, no assurance can be given that such levels will be achieved in the timeframe indicated or at all or that additional unanticipated costs will not arise. We currently estimate the majority of the cost to achieve the anticipated synergies to be personnel reductions and related costs that may be required under the laws of the various countries where we operate, which we expect to continue incurring over the course of the next one to two years. As part of our reorganization plan, we are required to negotiate severance payments with worker representatives (labor unions) for FTEs being made redundant pursuant to a collective dismissal procedure provided under applicable regulations in various of the countries where we operate. While we fully intend to observe the relevant legal procedures and requirements and to negotiate in good faith, if we cannot reach an agreement on severance payments with such worker representatives or the employees, they may choose to bring administrative or judicial challenges, which could delay the achievement of our synergies and/or increase costs incurred in order to achieve such synergies. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates, including those described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be _able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition).” See also “Forward-Looking Statements.”_ (6) Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA margin for a given period represents Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA for that period divided by revenue net of vending fee for that period.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

226_2,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"Changes in general economic conditions, consumer confidence and consumer spending could have an adverse effect on our business.","Demand for snacks, hot and cold beverages and in-between meals correlates with consumer confidence and employment levels. Changes in general economic conditions directly impact consumer confidence and consumer spending, as well as the general business climate. Therefore, our results of operations and financial performance are subject to changes in the general economic conditions of the markets in which we sell our products. In particular, changes in consumer confidence and consumer spending as a consequence of changes to general economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business. Moreover, consumer confidence, consumer spending and general economic conditions may deteriorate significantly and remain depressed for an extended period. A negative development in general economic conditions or consumer confidence and consumer spending could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Downturns in general economic conditions and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects, which affect consumers’ disposable income, pose a risk to our business because consumers and businesses may adjust their spending in response to tighter credit markets, unemployment, negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products. Many factors affect discretionary spending, including general business conditions, inflation, interest rates, consumer debt levels, unemployment rates, foreign currency exchange rates and availability of consumer credit. These and other such macroeconomic factors are outside our control. Recessionary conditions and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment may also adversely influence our customers’ decision to contract for a self-service PoS on their premises as well as consumers’ discretionary consumption patterns. A majority of our PoS are located in office environments or other private self-service retail locations. Consequently, the majority of our sales from such PoS occur during the working week. There is therefore a correlation between the total number of items sold through our PoS and work force levels and the total number of hours worked which tend to suffer during recessionary periods. Additionally, general strikes by employees, particularly temporary halts in public transport, would reduce the exposure of our PoS to consumers and decrease our sales volume. For example, during the railway strikes in France we estimate our revenue from those points of sale declined by approximately €3 million between March and July 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Employee retrenchment, strikes, or uncertain economic prospects may lead customers to decide against investing in PoS and may lead consumers to make fewer beverage, snack and impulse purchases from our PoS, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,"The success of our business depends on consumer preferences, technological innovations and the consumer’s experience with the self-service PoS we operate.","We are a route-based unattended self-service coffee and convenience food provider operating in the highly competitive segments of the food and beverage market serving hot and cold beverages, in-between meals, snacks, and confectionary products. Changes in consumer preferences could affect both the demand for new PoS and the volume of products we sell from our PoS. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or our inability to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on our ability to respond to consumer trends, including 29 ----- changing tastes, food fads and concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, and product attributes and ingredients, as well as our ability to address special dietary requirements or preferences. In addition, changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including a preference for healthy eating, sustainable packaging, the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, changes in travel, workplace, vacation or leisure activity patterns, weather, or negative publicity arising from environmental concerns, or resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in the snack food and beverage industries. Furthermore, as millennials begin to form larger portions of the consumer pool, adapting our sales and marketing strategies to complement their purchasing habits will become increasingly important to our business. Any of these or other changes may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the products we sell and may require us to incur unplanned costs to respond to these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, existing technologies may develop further in the fields where we operate, which could impact our business and require significant investments. For example, wireless technology has developed as a practical medium through which cashless payments can be made. Furthermore, the ability to transmit sales and stock data remotely (telemetry) has led to significant developments in the industry. Other technological advances are also likely to become more widespread, including payments via mobile phone, PoS equipped with internet browsers, PoS that speak to the visually impaired as well as environmentally friendly PoS, which use less energy. If we are unable to adopt such advances in technology, our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, our continued success is also dependent on product innovation, both in terms of sourcing more technologically advanced PoS as well as new food and beverage products from suppliers. Responding to technological changes regularly requires capital expenditures, which could be above our management’s expectations or may strain our cash flow position and may not be fully recoverable from revenue streams created by such expenditures. Additionally, we are organized on a decentralized geographic basis, which can delay or prevent successful implementation of group-wide roll-outs of the above projects. There can be no assurance that we can acquire or successfully implement new models or variants of existing PoS models or that we will be successful in stocking such PoS with the products that will be most appealing to consumers. Furthermore, our success is dependent on the consumer’s experience with the PoS we operate. To generate revenue and profits, we must stock food and beverage products that appeal to consumer preferences in PoS that consistently and reliably dispense the products we offer. If consumers encounter PoS that contain undesirable products, have been vandalized, or malfunction, our reputation may suffer and consumers may no longer seek to patronize our PoS, leading to a decline in revenue, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,"Our business is exposed to fluctuations in costs related to fuel, coffee and other commodity prices.","Our business operations rely on frequent restocking and maintenance of PoS at numerous locations. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in costs related to fuel and other transportation inputs. In addition, we source significant amounts of coffee at the Group level for the operation of our coffee machines and roaster facilities, including our own Pelican Rouge and Miofino brands of coffee blends. Supply and price of coffee beans can be affected by multiple factors, such as weather, pest damage, politics, competitive pressures and economies of the producing countries. The price of green bean coffee has fluctuated significantly in recent years. For example, the price of arabica coffee increased by more than 100% from November 2013 to April 2014 and prices ranged from U.S.$2.30 per pound in October 2011 to U.S.$1.09 per pound in October 2018 (based on the ICE ‘C’ New York index). In the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we spent €43.2 million on green coffee beans at our roaster, which accounted for 8.3% of our costs of material and consumables. We manage the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices by partly hedging the price of coffee beans. While our hedging strategy enables us to partly mitigate adverse effects of coffee beans price fluctuations over a certain period, it does not allow us to mitigate the risks associated with the valuation of hedging instruments, which may become too expensive due to commodity prices fluctuations, and the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also procure food and beverage products from suppliers, the costs of which are indirectly linked to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities such as cocoa and sugar. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in passing on cost increases to customers or consumers without losses in revenue or gross margin. As a consequence, sudden and significant changes in the prices of coffee and other commodities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 30 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,Changes in governmental regulations and legislation may subject us to new and onerous obligations.,"The food and beverage industry is regulated by various European and national legislation and regulations covering food safety and hygiene, packaging, nutritional information, broader public health and diet concerns, and public tenders for placement of self-service PoS on public premises. For example, EU Regulation 852/2004 sets out general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs and EU Regulation 853/2004 regulates, among other things, the temperature settings of PoS that stock products made from or containing animal products, such as meats and cheeses. We may also be subject to new or additional UK regulations following Brexit (as defined herein). See “—The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European _Union may have a negative effect on our business.” Moreover, as governments target lowering obesity rates and_ obesity-related illnesses, sales of certain snack foods will become discouraged. In the UK, for example, in order to qualify for government funding, National Health Services, including hospital premises must comply with certain standards, including a ban on the price promotion, advertisement, and sale of food and drinks that are high in fat, salt, sugar, and saturates, and provision of healthy food and drinks options to patients and staff at all times. Although regulations such as the above do not directly regulate our business, our customers will require us to provide them with a product mix that ensures their compliance with such regulations and will not consider suppliers who cannot provide the appropriate products. Moreover, as government standards for food quality increase, our suppliers’ production costs of such items, including organic products, also increase; these increases are passed up the chain to the consumers, which could lead to lower sale volumes. In April 2016, the United Kingdom government announced the introduction of a National Living Wage, which replaced the national minimum wage for people aged 25 and over in the United Kingdom. The National Minimum Wage remained in place for all working people under the age of 25 who are at least school leaving age in the United Kingdom. In April 2019, the National Minimum Wage for people from school leaving age in the United Kingdom to 18 was increased to £4.35 per hour. At the same time, the National Minimum Wage for people aged 18 to 20 and for people aged 21 to 24 increased to £6.15 per hour and £7.70 per hour respectively, while the National Living Wage for people aged 25 and over was increased to £8.21 per hour. As we employ some of our staff at the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, any further increase in the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage, or their scope, could increase our operating costs. In addition, individuals may be subject to criminal prosecution for deliberately not complying with the legislation and anyone found guilty may be disqualified from being a company director for up to 15 years. Additionally, in order to remain competitive, we strive to pay our workers at slightly higher rates than the National Minimum Wage and the National Living Wage. As minimum wage rates increase, we may increase the wages of our higher paid employees in line with increases granted to our minimum wage employees. These higher labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. While we cannot be certain how this will affect our business, an increase in the minimum wage rate paid to certain workers will increase our labor costs, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, stricter requirements regarding energy consumption of our PoS and the use of recyclable or biodegradable containers in connection with our coffee machines could adversely affect our business operations. Compliance with such laws and regulations could require us to make additional investments in new PoS and equipment, and failure to comply could result in the imposition of fines and other remedial measures. For example, our PoS in Germany must be accompanied with a space for consumers to recycle their used coffee cups; the failure to provide recycling facilities can result in fines from the German regulator. In addition, the UK has indicated it intends to add new levies in regards to plastic packaging, which could include a tax on the use of plastic cups in our PoS. Were the UK or other jurisdictions to impose taxes on the use of plastic cups this could result in significant additional costs and may decrease the profitability of our products. Any such changes in regulations or costs incurred to comply with stricter regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to obtain and comply with numerous permits, approvals, licenses and certificates from the respective government authorities of each jurisdiction in which we operate, in relation to health, safety (including the security of our facilities) and environmental regulations. The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex. In addition, such permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits or approvals, or failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, may result in the delay or temporary suspension of our operations and sales and may subject us to penalties and other sanctions. For example, we operate a 14,000 square meter coffee roasting facility in Dordrecht, the Netherlands. Given its potential impact on the environment, this facility qualifies as a type B facility under Dutch environmental laws. This qualification does not require us to obtain an environmental operating permit (omgevingsvergunning milieu) 31 ----- to carry out our activities but requires us to do an annual assessment to confirm this type B status. If we are unable to confirm this status and are required to obtain an operating permit, and if we are unable to obtain this permit, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, complying with new legislation or regulations, or changed interpretations of existing legislations or regulations, may require us to incur significant expense. For example, a recent preliminary court judgment in California concluded that companies are required to give consumers clear and reasonable warning about the presence of high levels of acrylamide in coffee products, that is considered toxic and carcinogenic and that it can impact the consumer’s health. Should similar judgments or regulatory requirements become applicable in the jurisdictions we operate, it could result in an increase in our operating costs to comply with such regulations as well as negatively affect the public perception of the consumption of coffee, potentially having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “—Any negative impact _on the reputation of the brand names of certain of the key products we sell may adversely affect our competitive position.” We cannot predict the amounts of any increases in capital expenditures or operating costs that we may_ incur to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or whether we will be able to pass on these costs to our consumers through price increases. Additionally, any tightening of regulations applicable to certain materials and processes that we use could force us to use more expensive processes and decrease the profitability of our products. Any failure to obtain or comply with required permits and approvals for our operations, or the possible imposition of fines or undertaking of capital investments in the aforementioned cases, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Depending on location, our self-service PoS compete, in terms of product selection and price with a combination of cafés, kiosks, fast-food restaurants, delicatessens, sandwich shops, gas stations, convenience stores, and supermarkets, among others. In office locations we also compete with coffee machine manufacturers who offer office coffee services and may seek to expand in that market segment. As a result of this competitive environment, our suppliers will have multiple channels through which they can sell and distribute products, which gives them significant bargaining advantages. Furthermore, an increase in the number of alternative locations in close proximity to our PoS that sell the same or similar products that we sell through our PoS, or the extension of the opening hours of such locations, would increase the competitive environment and could result in consumers purchasing similar food and beverage products through other channels. For example, in recent years, the number of mobile kiosks and small shops selling coffee and snack foods in train stations where we operate has significantly increased. These alternative outlets can also reduce our coffee sales in offices, as consumers can instead buy their coffee on the commute to work. In addition, if the train or metro platforms on which we have public contracts to operate are under construction for extended periods of time, consumers may become accustomed to purchasing coffee from one of our competitors. In general, the self-service retail operator sector is characterized by extensive logistics, distribution, and maintenance service requirements. Although the Unattended SSR Market is currently fragmented, future consolidation in the industry among existing operators could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain competitors, such as Nespresso, may have greater capital and other resources and superior brand recognition relative to us and may be able to provide more sophisticated PoS or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. In addition, certain competitors may enter into partnership agreements with producers of well-known coffee brands that may further increase competition with our products. For example, in August 2018 Nestlé, which owns Nespresso, entered into a global licensing arrangement with Starbucks that would give Nespresso the right to market Starbucks’ coffee in retail outlets globally outside the café chain. Moreover, certain competitors such as Coca-Cola, develop, own, and operate their own PoS, which may have superior functionality to our PoS at a lower cost to our customers. Also, in January 2019 Coca-Cola completed the acquisition of Costa coffee chain from Whitbread, and in December 2018 Lavazza bought an arm of Mars Drinks including the single-serve Flavia machine and the Klix freestanding machine business. These competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, secure the most advantageous locations for their PoS or otherwise make more attractive offers to customers and consumers. New market entrants in a particular market segment, such as Café Royal in the coffee procurement, roasting, and packaging segment, could also increase competition in procurement for and sale of coffee from our coffee roasting segment. New market entrants in a particular country or region could also lead to oversaturation in the market, limiting our growth potential in that area. There can be 32 ----- no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in our market and a loss in market share or other factors described above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we partner from time to time with caterers and facility management companies to place our PoS in facilities where they operate. Facility management companies are appointed to manage the catering and other food and beverage suppliers of large offices and companies. If a caterer or facility management company establishes a formal partnership with another self-service retail operator or decides to operate the PoS business themselves, our sales could be negatively affected. For example, our business in the UK may suffer if one of our facility management customers, Compass, successfully creates its own self-service retail services. Furthermore, facility management companies generally have a strong impact on our pricing in the private sector due to their function as the intermediary between us and the customer. They typically demand lower prices in order to retain the flexibility of adding their own margins to the final price, and to ensure the provision of the lowest price to their customers. If their price reduction requirements are not met, they may grant the business to other caterers and machine manufacturers. In addition, these contracts require a combination of business development and international customer management. Our business operates on an internationally decentralized basis and our teams may not be able to coordinate efficiently to address the needs of our customers. Any failure to maintain our contracts with such catering or facility management companies could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to maintain or increase prices in response to competitive pressures may also be limited. Additionally, increasing operating costs, including vending fees with certain customers, may offset increases in margins that rising prices might otherwise produce. As a result, we cannot assure you that competitive dynamics will not require us to make investments in our PoS park, or that we will be able to increase prices with sufficient flexibility and speed to preserve or increase our margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

If these vending fees increase or we are unable to respond effectively, including if we are unable to pass on the full extent of the increases to our customers, our profitability could suffer and we may fail to retain or win new customers. Our vending fee arrangements include fixed and variable rent agreements or combinations thereof, and are based on certain factors including, among others, public tender specifications, expected revenue, contract length, competitors’ offers and the demographics of the relevant location.

In particular, our business operations involve the transfer of large volumes of cash between locations, which exposes us to the risk of loss or theft. We are subject to various legal and regulatory requirements and risks in the countries in which we have facilities or operations, involving compliance with the UK Bribery Act 2010, European Anti-Bribery Conventions and other similar laws, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient in order to prevent or detect inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law by our management, employees, agents or contractors. For example, the cash collection process is performed by employees or by third party service providers, with either centralized or decentralized cash control supervisory teams, depending on the country, whose methods may lack adequacy in detecting mishandling of cash. Compliance and controls systems of certain countries may be incomplete, unreliable, or inaccurately transmit data due either to technical shortcomings which may or not be in our control, or malicious efforts of internal staff and third parties. Such malicious efforts include manual input of cash data in systems and are exacerbated by poor or inconsistent control execution from branch to branch within a country. Therefore, we may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of theft, fraud, bribery and corruption involving our employees, management, directors, agents, contractors or other third parties 33 ----- in the future. To the extent we are not successful in protecting ourselves from such activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences.

These systems and processes include, but are not limited to, route-planning, ordering and managing stock from suppliers, coordinating the logistics of restocking our PoS, distributing products to various locations, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. If such systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations, which could negatively affect our revenue and results of operations by impeding our ability to distribute products and restock our PoS. These interruptions could be caused by any number of events, including catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, disruptions at our data maintenance suppliers, or our experienced IT employees being unavailable or ceasing to work for us. Moreover, because consumer decisions to purchase snack food and beverages are contextually specific and can change on a day-to-day basis (or even during the course of a day), a lost vend due to a PoS malfunction or a lack of stock cannot typically be recouped once the malfunction has been addressed or the PoS has been restocked. Additionally, if we are found to not be in compliance with the license requirements of our software providers or other third parties, they may bring claims against us and terminate our licensing agreements with them. Failures in our systems could therefore reduce our revenue, adversely affect our reputation among our customers and consumers generally, compromise our competitive position or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to equip our PoS with telemetry in the near future is integral to our success. We expect many of our largest customers, including Shell and FM, will require real-time sales data in order to improve their consumer understanding and to test our ability to provide effective 24/7 customer service. Therefore, our successful roll-out of telemetry equipped PoS will be crucial to maintaining some of our largest customers. As of June 30, 2019, we have equipped approximately 29% of our eligible PoS park with telemetry, and expect to complete this roll-out by 2022. Additionally, our exposure to the risk of cyber security breaches, internal security breaches or other unauthorized or accidental access to the servers, other information systems or databases which we control or have access to is heightened when we transmit information over the internet or introduce new, or make changes or upgrades to existing products and services or servers, other information systems, or databases. Furthermore, a significant number of our existing IT systems are nearing the end of their economic life and some of our IT systems lack the technology and automation which is becoming standard across our industry. For example, our internal IT systems do not interface among each other, we are missing certain system controls at a central level and we regularly experience control deficiencies throughout our business, which we have currently addressed through manual controls. Manual controls, as opposed to IT based controls, are costly and inefficient as they do not provide an appropriate level of risk mitigation in regards to fraudulent behavior. Additionally, some of our outdated custom made applications are no longer supported and cannot be developed further internally. Because of outdated IT systems, many of our internal reports have been prepared based on data extracted from systems and processed manually. Inappropriate handling of spreadsheets containing calculations may result in misstatements and our existing IT may not provide management with data in an adequate and consistent form, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Due to its extraterritorial scope of application, it also applies to entities outside the EU (e.g. to our Swiss business), when processing personal data from data subjects in the EU. The implementation of these requirements of the GDPR put a significant burden on our legal and compliance functions. The task to meet all the GDPR requirements on an ongoing basis is relatively complex. While our operating companies are all currently located in the EU (subject to the outcome of Brexit), the EEA or in a country that has an adequate level of data protection pursuant to an EU Commission decision, and we do not face the implications associated with the intra-group data transfer to the so-called “third countries” (according to art. 44 et seqq. GDPR), we can, nevertheless, not guarantee that our operations are at all times in compliance with all the requirements of the GDPR (and its implementing ordinances by Member States). To the extent that we violate the requirements set out in the GDPR, sanctions may be imposed. These sanctions depend on the nature of the infringed provision and may consist in civil liabilities and criminal sanctions. Criminal sanctions can include fines of up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for each infraction. Additional penalties may apply, such as the deprivation of profits.

Swiss and other applicable data protection legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, including our employees or customers, which could negatively affect our reputation, customer relationships, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also the pending amendment of the Swiss Data Protection Act, which will enter into force in 2020 at the earliest, may lead to more strict data protection requirements and more severe consequences in case of breach.

We are dependent on the Starbucks and the Lavazza brands for the success of our business but we have limited control over these and other brands we supply to our customers. Any failure on the part of the owners of such brands to defend their intellectual property rights or preserve and build their brands’ reputations could compromise such reputations or the public’s perception of such brands, thereby diminishing the value of such brands and potentially having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we have entered into partnership agreements in connection with certain of our offerings, such as our partnership with 365 Retail Market, a self-checkout workplace technology provider offering fresh food, among other products. While food safety is a top priority for us and we strive to ensure that consumers enjoy safe, quality food products, claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry. Because we purchase prepared food from our suppliers, food safety could be out of our control, and we rely on suppliers and distributors to label and transport food in accordance with the relevant food safety regulations. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illness or other food safety issues such as food tampering or contamination at one of our locations could adversely impact our reputation across our brand. Furthermore, any negative impact on the reputation of our partners could also have a negative effect on our reputation and products, and as a consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we have built a reputation for our own brands, such as Pelican Rouge and Miofino, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience. To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Our business strategy relies significantly on the success of the brands in our existing and new markets. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring, that erode consumer trust, such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy, contaminated food, employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, product recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this “Risk Factors” section, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media, or result in litigation, and any failure to respond promptly and appropriately to these incidents, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The sale of any of the third party products in our PoS or the coffee from our coffee roasting facility can also give rise to product liability claims against us. Such claims, especially with regards to our roasting facility products, can be very costly to defend and involve large damages. Product liability claims could harm our reputation, regardless of the merit or ultimate success of the claim, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Consumer demand for our products and our brands could diminish significantly if we fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, disposal, content or sale of our products or the use of consumer data, failure to comply with laws and regulations or failure to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets.

For example, as of January 1, 2014, the Italian VAT rate applicable to PoS products increased from 4.0% to 10.0%. In addition, as of the same date, the French VAT rate applicable to confectionary items increased from 19.6% to 20.0% and to hot drinks rose from 7.0% to 10.0% (but decreased from 5.5% to 5.0% for canned beverages). Moreover, as healthy eating becomes a larger priority for government authorities, the prices of our product offering may increase due to any taxes imposed to discourage consumers from purchasing such items. The UK, for example, has begun to impose an additional tax on soft drinks in 2018, and may consider introducing a tax on single-use plastic waste, which may negatively affect the sales volumes for, or reduce our margins on, our cold beverages. VAT increases affect the prices consumers pay for food and beverage items, and therefore reduces their purchasing power, especially if it coincides with a decline in economic conditions or high levels of unemployment. As a self-service retail operator, we are obliged to respond to VAT rate increases by discussing with our customers the re-pricing of the food and beverage items sold in a PoS on their premises. As many of our contracts are based on a fixed price per product and do not contain automatic pass-through mechanisms, our regional and area managers must engage with customers to reach an agreement. An increase in VAT rates typically reduces our margins on contracts with a fixed output price, as the output VAT is already included in the selling price. Following any agreement to raise selling prices, our PoS operators must re-price items on display in our PoS. For automatic PoS equipped with digital price displays, this may be relatively simple, however, for the majority of our PoS base with conventional displays, re-pricing has cost and time implications. Accordingly, any future increase of VAT in a market where we operate, especially under a fixed price agreement, may negatively affect our revenue and increase our operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

For example, a significant strengthening of the euro compared to the pound sterling or to the Swiss franc could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, particularly in relation to the price of certain raw materials upon which we rely. Moreover, we may be unable to pass along increased costs to our customers or our customers may be less willing to purchase our products at higher prices. Conversely, our customers may demand that we reduce our prices where any changes in currency exchange rates may have been beneficial to our operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenue as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of the international nature of our operations, we are subject to foreign exchange risk, including currency translation, transactional and operating exposure. In particular, the exchange rates between the euro and the pound sterling or to the Swiss franc have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. As we report in euro, we are subject to risks relating to the conversion into euros of the statements of financial position and income statements of our subsidiaries who conduct business in Swiss franc, Danish and Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, and pound sterling. In addition, we are subject to risks arising from outstanding nominal foreign currency financial and trade receivables or payables incurred prior to but due to be settled after a change to the relevant exchange rate, which affect our current cash flows. A weakening of one or more of the foreign currencies in which we operate against the euro necessarily reduces our euro-denominated revenue. As a large portion of our expenses are borne in euro, a depreciation of the pound sterling, Swiss franc, Danish or Norwegian krone, or Swedish krona against the euro would decrease our profitability. Alternatively, such changes in currency exchange rates may have a long-term impact on demand for our products as we may become less competitive outside the euro zone due to the higher prices that customers and consumers outside the euro zone may have to pay for our products. We may not be able to manage effectively the currency risks we face, and volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements and may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 37 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

We also have a partnership with 365 Retail Market, a self-checkout workplace technology provider, in regards to our MicroMarkets, and a loss of this partnership could have a material adverse effect on our MicroMarkets offering. In addition to our private self-service retail customer contracts, we also maintain contracts with public customers, who generally have longer terms and are awarded pursuant to public tenders in accordance with EU and national public tenders laws. We can give no assurance that we will successfully compete in future auction processes for public service contracts or that current public self-service retail customers will continue to welcome our PoS on their premises. We are also subject to the risk that contracts with public customers could face legal challenge because public tender rules were not followed.

A downturn in the European 39 ----- economy could have adverse effects on our business in every market in which it operates. In addition, since the completion of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition, we have increased our presence in the United Kingdom, which in turn increases our exposure to the negative outcomes of Brexit. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, the United Kingdom (including Express Vending) accounted for 15% of our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) and 12% of our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC). The most pertinent issue posed by Brexit is possible short term delays in the importation of goods. Although our suppliers have contingency plans in place to maintain supply and we are able to increase manufacturing and delivery of buffer stock to the UK prior to Brexit, these measures may not be effective in the long-term. Other possible negative outcomes resulting from Brexit include: significantly disrupted trade between the United Kingdom and the EU; political and economic instability in other countries of the EU, which covers the majority of our markets; and instability in the global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the euro and the pound sterling. The depreciation of the pound sterling against the euro has caused, and may continue to cause, an increase in the price of consumer goods in the UK that are sourced from the EU. Therefore, Brexit might also affect our ability to maintain the current level of sales in the United Kingdom. The financial, trade and legal implications of Brexit are unknown and there is uncertainty as to whether, and to what extent, our business might be affected. Therefore, Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our existing business or perform in line with expectations. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected. No assurance can be given that we will be able to fully integrate the operations of the businesses we will acquire without encountering difficulties, which may include, among other things, the loss of key employees, diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, procedures and policies. In addition, we may not have, or be able to retain, employees with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with our integration plan and could experience employee departures and early retirement, all of which could adversely affect our integration efforts. Additionally, integration of acquired businesses into our business is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process, and may face unforeseen challenges. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate new business practices and operations with ours, with which we may not have previous experience. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating new businesses and to realize any anticipated benefits of such transactions could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

For example, on August 17, 2018, we completed the Express Vending Acquisition; on February 2, 2018, we completed the Argenta Acquisition; and on September 7, 2017, we completed the Pelican Rouge Acquisition. As the integration of these acquired businesses is ongoing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate these businesses into our existing business. Further, in order to realize the full benefits of such acquisitions, we have implemented certain operational efficiency and cost saving measures, as further described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors _Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Anticipated Cost Savings and Synergies Resulting from Acquisitions.” We may not be able to realize the anticipated benefit of these measures, either in the amount_ or within the timeframe expected, and the costs of achieving such measures may be higher than expected. Our ability to realize such operational efficiency and cost saving measures may be affected by a number of factors, including regulations with respect to personnel and negotiations with trade unions, delays in the ability of our suppliers to deliver certain innovations we require to implement our plans and delays due to required systems 40 ----- modifications, which may offset the cost savings expected to be realized as part of past or future acquisitions, including from the Express Vending Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Pelican Rouge Acquisition. Moreover, successful integration and the realization of synergies require, among other things, proper coordination of business development and marketing efforts, retention of certain key members of management, policies for effective recruitment and training as well as the ability to adapt information and computer systems. Any difficulties encountered in combining operations could result in higher integration costs and lower savings or revenues than expected. There will accordingly be uncertainty as to the extent to which anticipated synergies from acquisitions will be achieved and the timing of their realization. Moreover, the integration of Selecta’s existing operations with the operations of such acquired businesses (including the Pelican Rouge, Argenta and Express Vending businesses) could interfere with the respective businesses and divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation. In addition, our ability to realize any anticipated synergies is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, such as labor laws, changes to government regulation governing or otherwise impacting our industry, employee strikes, changes in the political environment in countries where we operate, obtaining appropriate approvals and licenses, operating difficulties, consumer preferences, changes in competition and general economic or industry conditions. Consequently, we may overestimate the cost synergies that will result from past or future acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition) or underestimate the time or cost required to implement such synergy plans.

Many of our PoS include cold drinks, which have historically generated increased vends during the summer months. Coffee vends generally exhibit less variation, but can also be affected by some seasonal factors, especially for our PoS inside offices or in other private locations, where vends are lower during public holidays. In addition, severe weather can influence consumer traffic patterns in high-traffic areas such as gas stations, train and subway stations and airports. If, for example, transportation services are closed due to heavy snow or rain, our PoS in those locations may be accessible to significantly fewer consumers and vends lost on a particular business day typically cannot be recouped in the future. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to effectively manage the stocking of our products influenced by seasonal variation or that severe weather or other events will not reduce our vends at certain locations, the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

For this reason, and taking into particular consideration our leading market positions in France, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK, we may be accused of the abuse of our position or the use of anti-competitive practices. This risk may increase in the event we acquire companies that have market leading positions in the countries in which we operate. Any such claims could adversely affect our reputation, potentially result in legal proceedings that could have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and require us to divest assets in markets where we have a dominant or leading position. Such claims could also impair our ability to conduct acquisitions accretive to our business. Before certain future acquisitions can be consummated, we may be required to seek approvals and consents from regulatory agencies or there may be applicable waiting periods that will need to expire. We may be unable to obtain such regulatory approvals or consents, or, in order to obtain them, we may be required to dispose of assets or take other actions that could have the effect of reducing our revenue. Even if regulatory authorities do not require disposals or other actions, the regulatory approval process triggered by our market position or claims of anti-competitive practices may have the effect of delaying acquisitions. For example, on July 17, 2014, the Italian Competition Authority (“ICA”) initiated proceedings against the Argenta Group pursuant to article 14 of Law n. 287/90 to assess an allegation against Argenta Group and eight other companies operating in the self-service retail in connection with potential unlawful market sharing. On February 25, 2015, the ICA initiated proceedings against three additional companies and CONFIDA Associazione Italiana Distribuzione Automatica, the association representing the main companies of the Italian 41 ----- retail industry, and extended the investigation into further allegations of anti-competitive behavior in relation to certain private and public tenders for self-service retail services. On June 14, 2016, the ICA issued its final decision holding the Argenta Group and all other parties to the proceeding (except for Gedac S.r.l.) had infringed art. 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The ICA imposed on all parties fines at the maximum possible level provided under Law n. 287/90, consisting of 10% of the overall annual turnover of a company. The fine imposed on Argenta Group is equal to €19.7 million. On June 27, 2016, the ICA granted Argenta Group’s request to pay the fine in 30 monthly installments of €0.7 million each beginning in August 2016 and ending in January 2019; these payments were not indemnified under the Argenta Acquisition Agreement. On November 28, 2017, Argenta Group filed an appeal before the Italian Council of State to obtain a reduction of the amount of the fine. All instalments of the penalty have been paid, however, the appeal for the reduction of the total amount remains ongoing. Individuals or companies affected by the illegal conduct could rely on the ICA decision to bring civil damages actions against Argenta Group and the other addressees of the decision. Damages actions are subject to a limitation period of five years from cessation of the damaging conduct. In this case, the damaging conduct could be deemed to have stopped, when the ICA opened the relevant investigation in July 2014, and no damage action has been brought to date.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Our PoS are generally insured by our customers against damage and vandalism, pursuant to provisions of our customer contracts which require such insurance to be procured by the customer or included as part of its general insurance policy coverage. Our other fixed assets, such as our office buildings, technical equipment used in distribution, restocking and PoS refurbishment, information technology and office equipment are protected by a group insurance policy (damages from fire, natural catastrophes, theft, flood and severe weather) that includes certain related business interruption insurance. Our insurance policies are subject to limitations and exclusions. Furthermore, we do not have insurance for every type of interruption since such risks cannot be insured or can only be insured on inadequate or onerous terms. For example, while we fulfil our insurer’s necessary requirements with respect to our coffee roasting facility, our insurer has noted that the facility lacks a sprinkler system, the costs of installing which outweigh the benefits. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our insurance programs would be sufficient to cover all potential losses, that we will be able to obtain sufficient levels of property insurance coverage in the future or that such coverage will be available on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, certain types of losses, such as those resulting from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, environmental hazards or terrorist acts, may not be fully insurable or may be uninsurable. Moreover, the business impact of any resulting interruptions has not been quantified and our insurance coverage may not be aligned with management’s expectations. For example, although our coffee roasting plant is generally insured, if for any reason our roaster is inoperable for a period of time, the losses we would suffer from the shortage of the coffee supply are not insured, while the cost associated with replacing the roaster would be approximately €3 million. We use our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits, deductibility provisions and the appropriateness of self-insuring with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer an uninsured or underinsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a business or property as well as the anticipated future revenue from such business or property.

In the event that such key personnel choose not to remain with us, there is a risk that they may join a competing business.

We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our senior management team and other key employees to execute our business plans. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain key management and sales personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key management and sales personnel and other key employees.

As of June 30, 2019, we employed 10,305 FTEs under a variety of arrangements consistent with local laws and employment practices. The countries in which we operate provide various bargaining rights, among other protections, to employees. These employment rights may require us to expend greater time and costs in altering or amending employees’ terms of employment or discontinuing employment relationships. Although we believe that we have good relations with the labor unions and other such organizations that represent our labor force, we cannot assure you that we will not experience a deterioration in our labor relations, resulting in strikes or other disturbances occasioned by our unionized labor force. For example, labor unions may organize strikes if they disagree with our business strategy for the Group. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements with the unions representing our labor force, we will be able to reach new agreements on satisfactory terms or that we would agree on such new agreements without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. In certain instances, we consult and seek the input of our employee works councils with respect to a broad range of matters. While we generally have been able to successfully consult with our works councils and we regard our relations with our executives, employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may be challenging in connection with the integration process of the Group, as we seek to achieve competitive cost structures in each market in which we operate while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our executives and employees. Consultations with works councils, strikes, similar industrial actions or other disturbances by our workforce could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of reputation, increased wages and benefits or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

From time to time, we have been party as defendant or plaintiff to various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our business, such as those related to employment matters, deductibility of interest and VAT payments and refunds, among others. For example, the Dutch tax authorities have challenged the deductibility of interest expenses on certain shareholder loans of Pelican Rouge B.V. for the financial years 2011 through 2014, and concluded that interest on these shareholder loans is not deductible. This conclusion has resulted in additional tax assessments of approximately €22 million. We appealed this decision in 2016 and are awaiting a judgement from the court. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not made any payment to the tax authorities. In connection with this claim, the purchase price for the acquisition of Pelican Rouge was reduced.

Changes in tax laws or enforcement thereof could adversely affect the Group’s tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. The Group often relies on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with the Group’s interpretation of these laws. If the Group’s tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require the Group to pay taxes that the Group currently does not collect or pay or increase the costs of the Group’s services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase the Group’s costs of operations or the Group’s effective tax rate and have a negative effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we face the risk of challenges to the tax deductibility of interest on intercompany loans.

The Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees. Given the Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our results.

We have the ability to borrow up to €150.0 million under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is secured by the Collateral, and the Indenture also permits the incurrence of additional debt thereunder. As of June 30, 2019, €106.9 million was drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, which we intend to repay in full using a portion of the proceeds from the Offering.

Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures. Neither our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark.

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. The Collateral provided as security for the Notes is limited to liens granted by Guarantors over the shares in other Guarantors and over intercompany structural loans granted to Guarantors whose shares have been so pledged and to liens over material bank accounts of the Issuer. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property or other assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.,"The security interests that secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Existing Notes have and the holders of the Additional Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a security document are validly secured and/or can be enforced; this area of law is untested in the courts of certain jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such 54 ----- security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under the laws of Belgium, England and Wales, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral includes a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Belgium, England and Wales, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland and pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Belgium, England and Wales, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee 55 ----- against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral (the “Security Interests”). In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the Security Interests is limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the _Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or 56 ----- - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Changes in general economic conditions directly impact consumer spending as well as the investment levels of our customers in non-essential services, such as PoS and services. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we derived 47.0% of our revenue from workplace points of sale, which include OCS. As PoS in such privately placed points of sale are generally located on companies’ premises in office environments and similar locations, macroeconomic factors such as GDP and employment levels, among others, affect the number of items sold through these PoS. For example, reductions in workforce numbers or hours worked during times of economic downturn (including the effects of reduced overtime, layoffs and increased reliance on part-time versus full-time workers) means that our PoS on companies’ premises and in office environments are available to fewer consumers or consumers with lower purchasing power due to reduced income or more conservative spending habits. On the other hand, economic growth may have a positive impact on our ability to generate new business if companies invest in non-essential services, such as the decision to contract for the placement of a PoS on their premises. Variations in consumer spending or consumer purchasing power can also affect revenue generated from our PoS in public locations, but macroeconomic conditions generally have less impact on our public selfservice retail operations compared to our private operations. In addition, our revenues in any given period are affected by our ability to maintain the appeal of our PoS to existing consumers and attract new consumers, which depends on continuous development and improvement of our range of products and services offering that are responsive to evolving trends and consumer preferences. For instance, our increasing focus on premium coffee brands and the introduction of touchscreen technology and 66 ----- cashless payment options for our PoS, including our mobile phone app, Selecta eWallet, are driven by changing consumer behaviors. Specific factors affecting consumer spending in our PoS include our ability to maintain and improve an attractive product assortment, including through partnerships with Starbucks and Lavazza, the location and overall aesthetic appeal of our PoS, the accessibility and integration of our on-the-go PoS channels, and our ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing consumer demands and preferences.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Many of our PoS include cold drinks, which have historically generated increased sales during the summer months. Coffee sales generally exhibit less variation, but may also be affected by seasonal factors, especially for our PoS inside offices or in other private locations, where sales are lower during holiday seasons. In addition, severe weather can influence consumer traffic patterns in high-traffic areas such as gas stations, train and subway stations, and airports. If, for example, transportation services are closed due to heavy snow or rain, our PoS in such locations may be accessible by significantly fewer consumers and vends lost on a particular business day typically cannot be recouped in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations and Financial Condition,17.3.3,Capital Expenditures,"We incur capital expenditures in connection with the purchase of new PoS and the refurbishment of existing PoS in the ordinary course of business. We own approximately 78% of the PoS that we service, which we fund through cash on balance sheet or finance leases, with the remaining PoS being owned or leased directly by our customers. In addition, we incur capital expenditures in connection with the development of new technologies for the retail industry, such as the ability to transmit sales and stock data remotely. We divide our capital expenditures into gross capital expenditures, net capital expenditures, and cash capital expenditures. Gross capital expenditures consist of self-service retail equipment purchased; net capital expenditures consist of gross capital expenditures less the book value of total disposals of self-service retail equipment (which includes old PoS sold); and cash capital expenditures consist of net capital expenditures net of self-service retail equipment bought through finance lease arrangements during the same period. Capital expenditures excludes purchase of PoS where alternative arrangements are made through third parties, such as Lavazza, to finance PoS investments. We have launched a capital intensity program in order to reduce our total cash capital expenditure. A part of our capital intensity program is to focus on refurbishing our PoS rather than purchasing new PoS, with a view of expanding the life cycle of our PoS from 6 to 18 years, which in turn decreases the number of new PoS required to maintain our PoS park. As part of this capital intensity program, we have also established two PoS upgrade centers in Madrid and Milan.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Nevertheless, the gain or loss of significant customers or a large number of customers in the same period would affect our results of operations. We manage our customer relationships differently depending on the market segment. With our workplace customers, our contractual relationships have a shorter duration, typically between three and five years, but such contracts often renew automatically. Customers in our on-the-go business channel (like train stations, gas stations, public institutions and hospitals) will typically organize periodic tenders for the assignment of multiyear contracts, sometimes lasting five to over ten years. Larger customers will also generally charge us a vending fee to place our PoS on their premises. Vending fees are negotiated according to formulas related to past or expected traffic in the relevant location and number of vends; vending fees can be either variable (based on total sales from the applicable PoS) or fixed (based on the number of PoS installed pursuant to the relevant contract). Our considerable experience in the self-service retail industry provides us with extensive datasets that we can use to calculate acceptable vending fees that will allow us to submit competitive bids on commercially viable pricing terms.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In both workplace and on-the-go channels, PoS density is one of the primary drivers of profitability and a key strategy in our acquisition program. PoS that are closer together can be more quickly and efficiently managed by the same personnel, which reduces transport time and the relative costs associated with labor, restocking, fuel, and maintenance. In contrast, single PoS in isolated locations may not generate sufficient gross profit to cover the costs of visits to clean, restock, or perform scheduled or unscheduled maintenance. Our revenue and margins are also driven by our mix of workplace and on-the-go services. Because the margins on our products may vary, changes in the mix of our product sales have a direct impact on our total revenue and profitability. Workplace self-service retail is our largest self-service concept by revenue and is primarily driven by sales of coffee and other hot beverages. Workplace self-service retail margins vary based on the type of PoS located in a particular area as well as the extent to which a customer agrees to subsidize the cost of products for its employees, or alternatively wants to receive a vending fee on it. Consumers generally consume more products and beverages when the cost is subsidized by their employers, leading to larger volumes of vends and higher margins. On-the-go self-service retail margins vary primarily based on the combination of the volume of vends and the price points for the products sold, which depend on the locations of the PoS and the number of other locations in close proximity to our PoS that sell the same or similar products, as well as the level of vending fee paid to the customer. Our partnerships with premium coffee brands such as Starbucks and Lavazza also provide us with the platform to offer a compelling product mix. Therefore, the combination of location, PoS density, product mix, prices and contributions paid to the customer are among the key factors which determine profitability of our PoS.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

For example, for our own coffee brands, we estimate we require approximately 7,400 tons of arabica green bean coffee and approximately 4,100 tons of robusta green bean coffee annually to regularly stock our hot drinks selfservice PoS or supply our customers with coffee beans. Overall, we purchase more than 20,000 tons of green bean coffee annually for our Pelican Rouge and Miofino brands, half of which we sell to third parties. Prices for green bean coffee have fluctuated significantly in recent years. For example, the price of arabica green bean coffee increased considerably from November 2013 to April 2014 and, alternatively, prices ranged from U.S.$2.30 per pound in October 2011 to U.S.$1.09 per pound in October 2018 (based on the ICE ‘C’ New York index). In order to manage risks from fluctuations in commodities prices, we secure the green bean requirements for periods of up to twelve months by instructing the relevant supplier to source the required green beans to cover certain production lots at a specific price. With certain strategic suppliers, we enter into longer-term agreements with agreed price adjustment mechanisms that reflect developments in commodity prices. For our other ingredients such as milk powders, cocoa, and sugar, we have quarterly price contracts with our suppliers ranging between six to twelve months. Following the completion of the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge and Argenta, we have strengthened our corporate procurement department to leverage our scale and obtain better prices. We have started to harmonize prices of products we purchase for our PoS (such as snacks or cold drinks), which are traditionally sourced at the country level, by leveraging our scale and negotiating prices with large suppliers (such as Coca-Cola) through strategic relationships at the Group level. While certain products, such as confectionary items and other stock items that cater to local or regional tastes, continue to be sourced on a country level, we source our own brand green bean coffee as well as cups, sugar, and stirrers, among other supplies, through our corporate procurement department, which allows us to secure more competitive pricing based on larger volume orders.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our roasting operations accounted for 4% of our revenue. We sell coffee to businesses, such as restaurants, coffee shops and self-service retail operators, and, in limited quantities, directly to consumers. Our roasting operations have primarily focused on the roasting, blending, packaging and sale of our own coffee brands, Pelican Rouge and Miofino. The results of our roasting operations are primarily affected by the level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry, our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers for our coffee and fluctuations in the selling prices of Pelican Rouge-branded coffee. In addition, investments required to maintain or repair our roasting facility have a material impact on our capital expenditures. 68 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The synergies resulting from these acquisitions primarily fall into three categories: (i) logistics and footprint optimizations, (ii) consolidation of procurement, and (iii) selling, general, and administrative costs across the entire organization. The integration process requires changes to our purchasing practices to improve margins, while also implementing our own systems and best practices and adjusting our combined organizational structure and management footprint to maximize synergies. In order to supervise this integration process, we have created an integration office at the group level led by a dedicated project manager with extensive experience in integrations and operational turnaround reporting to the Executive Chairman of the Group and supported by our senior management team and dedicated specialists. We expect to realize approximately €75 million of estimated annualized run-rate cost synergies from the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition by the end of 2020. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have realized approximately €52 million of these cost synergies, which represents 69% of our total expected cost synergies. See “Summary—Summary _Historical Financial and Other Information—Historical Consolidated Financial Information—Other Financial Data and Operating Information” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to realize the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition).” See also “Forward- Looking Statements.”_ Our total estimated cost synergies described above include the following: - Operating cost savings relating to logistics and footprint optimizations of approximately €33 million, of which we had realized €18 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized by (i) combining operations in areas with fewer PoS to reduce the number of employees required to maintain and refill these PoS, (ii) implementing Selecta’s refiller planning program, which is based on actual sales of each PoS rather than a theoretical model, (iii) cost savings by leveraging data from telemetry technology already in place in the Argenta Group’s PoS and by increasing the use of telemetry for PoS in France, Spain and the UK (iv) headcount reductions following the assessment of productivity of our technicians and through the integration of corporate, IT and other central functions, (v) footprint optimization by concentrating warehouses in the countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate, and (vi) logistics network synergies, including planning denser and more cost-effective routes. - Procurement savings of approximately €30 million, of which we had realized €22 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized by (i) obtaining better prices on ingredients through in-sourcing of our own brand coffee from Pelican Rouge’s roaster facility and international tender of raw materials used across the countries in which we operate, such as sugar, (ii) harmonizing prices of products we purchase for our PoS (such as snacks or cold drinks) by leveraging our scale and negotiating prices through strategic relationships at the Group level, (iii) savings on disposables, such as cups for our PoS, and packaging through leveraging our increased purchasing volume at the Group level, (iv) streamlining purchases of spare parts for our PoS, (v) indirect cost savings on our fleet, IT, marketing, and warehouses, and (vi) real estate savings as a result of terminating redundant leases and renegotiating existing leases. - Selling, general, and administrative cost savings of approximately €13 million, of which we had realized €12 million as of June 30, 2019. These savings are currently being realized through (i) headcount reductions as a result of integrating management teams in countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate and re-sizing our sales force, (ii) savings in connection with headcount reductions in the research and development department of the Group by leveraging Argenta’s research and development expertise, (iii) reductions in employee benefit expenses, such as cars, travel, and mobile phones, in connection with headcount reductions, (iv) combining headquarters in countries where both Selecta and Pelican Rouge operate and (v) additional productivity gains in sales, general and administrative costs. As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that we have incurred approximately €25 million in costs and capital expenditures to implement the foregoing synergies, and estimate that we will incur approximately €28 million in further costs and capital expenditures to realize our total targeted cost synergies. In particular, we expect to incur (i) total estimated severance costs of approximately €24 million, of which approximately €10 million have 69 ----- already been incurred as of June 30, 2019, and (ii) estimated integration costs of approximately €29 million, of which approximately €14 million have already been incurred as of June 30, 2019. Although it is our objective to reach the levels of projected synergies reflected above, no assurance can be given that such levels will be achieved in the timeframe indicated or at all or that additional unanticipated costs will not arise. We currently estimate the majority of the cost to achieve the anticipated synergies to be personnel reductions and related costs that may be required under the laws of the various countries where we operate, which we expect to continue incurring over the course of the next one to two years. As part of our reorganization plan, we are required to negotiate severance payments with worker representatives (labor unions) for FTEs being made redundant pursuant to a collective dismissal procedure provided under applicable regulations in various of the countries where we operate. While we fully intend to observe the relevant legal procedures and requirements and to negotiate in good faith, if we cannot reach an agreement on severance payments with such worker representatives or the employees, they may choose to bring administrative or judicial challenges, which could delay the achievement of our synergies and/or increase costs incurred in order to achieve such synergies. Our synergy estimates are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and our judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating synergies are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the synergy benefit estimates, including those described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to realize the anticipated _operational efficiencies and cost savings in connection with acquisitions (including the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, the Argenta Acquisition and the Express Vending Acquisition).” See also “Forward-Looking Statements.”_",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

We have included the operations of each of these entities in our audited consolidated financial information as of each of their respective acquisition dates. As a result, our audited consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018, includes the operations of Express Vending from August 17, 2018 to September 30, 2018, the operations of the Argenta Group from February 2, 2018 to September 30, 2018, and the full year results of operations of the Pelican Rouge Group. Since our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018 do not include the full year results of operations of the Express Vending Group and the Argenta Group, the comparability of our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2018 and as of and for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, with our financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017, and as of and for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively, is significantly limited. In addition, in connection with the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, in March 2018 we disposed of our Selecta operations in Finland (“legacy Selecta Finland”) to comply with antitrust requirements. For the year ended September 30, 2017, legacy Selecta Finland generated €13.9 million in revenue. As a result of applying IFRS 5 to our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2017, the assets and liabilities relating to legacy Selecta Finland are presented separately in dedicated lines in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017. The assets presented separately as “assets classified as held for sale” in our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, are valued at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The corresponding liabilities are presented separately as “liabilities associated with assets held for sale” in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017. On September 19, 2018, we sold Custompack to PortionPack Europe Group. Custompack focuses on the provision of single portion items such as wet sauces, dry products, and portion packing to its customers. Given Selecta’s strategy around strengthening its leading position as unattended self-service convenience food and beverage operator in Europe, Custompack was divested as a non-core business. The net disposal accounting gain recorded on the sale amounted to €0.6 million.

As our financial year begins on October 1[st] each year, we will apply IFRS 16 to our financial statements beginning from October 1, 2019. IFRS 16 introduces a single accounting model for lessees that principally obligates lessees to account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease contracts with a term of more than twelve months. The significant impact of IFRS 16 is the elimination of the classification according to IAS 17 (Leases) of lease contracts as operating leases and finance leases. As a result, leases, which were shown off-balance sheet according to IAS 17, will be recognized as a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet as of October 1, 2019. We intend to apply the modified retrospective approach to adopt IFRS 16, and will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption. IFRS 16 will primarily affect the accounting for our operating leases. We currently expect that IFRS 16 will lead to an increase in total assets and total liabilities of approximately €150 million from the effect of recognizing existing operating leases on the balance sheet. Additionally, annual operating lease expenses of approximately €40 million are expected to be presented as depreciation and interest expenses in the future, with a reduction for a similar amount in rent expenses, as part of our operating expenses.

This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €111.3 million to our revenue for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was partly offset by the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which had a negative impact of €13.2 million on our revenue over the same period. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals, our revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, would have increased by €31.3 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase of €19.6 million in revenue from our public business channel in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and in the Central region, and an increase of €16.1 million in trade machine sales, primarily in the North region. This increase was partly offset by our results of operations in France and the United Kingdom where we are currently implementing our turnaround plans. _Vending Fee_ Vending fee increased by €17.4 million, or 16.0%, from €108.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €126.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Argenta, which contributed €7.3 million to our vending fee expenses for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. The acquisition of Express Vending and the disposal of Custompack Ltd. did not impact our vending fees as they had no on-the-go business during these periods. Without giving effect to the acquisition of Argenta, our vending fees for the nine months June 30, 2019, would have increased by €10.2 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the increase in revenue in our public segment, which has associated vending fees. _Materials and Consumables Used_ Expenses for materials and consumables used increased by €31.2 million, or 8.4%, from €372.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €403.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €34.9 million to materials and consumables used for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was partly offset by the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which reduced 73 ----- materials and consumables used by €10.3 million over the same period. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals, material and consumable expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, would have increased by €6.5 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to the increase in revenue across the Group. _Employee Benefits Expense_ Employee benefits expense increased by €32.7 million, or 10.2%, from €322.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €354.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €34.0 million to employee benefit expenses for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was partly offset by the disposal of Custompack Ltd., which reduced employee benefit expenses by €3.1 million over the same period. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals, our employee benefit expenses for the nine months June 30, 2019, would have increased by €1.8 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to growth projects in certain countries, such as Switzerland, and expenses incurred in connection with investments in capabilities related to strategic transactions, which were largely offset by cost savings in connection with our synergy program and rightsizing our operations in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and Spain. _Depreciation and Amortization Expense_ Depreciation and amortization expense increased by €16.7 million, or 12.6%, from €132.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €149.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €8.3 million to our depreciation and amortization expense, mainly through depreciation expenses, for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals over the period, our depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, would have increased by €8.4 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to amortization of customer contracts at a Group level. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by €23.8 million, or 14.3%, from €166.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €190.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending, which collectively contributed €13.7 million to other operating expenses for the nine months June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals over the period, our other operating expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, would have increased by €10.1 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to operating expenses, such as consulting expenses of €7.2 million incurred at our headquarters and mainly related to strategic transactions. _Net Finance Costs_ Net finance costs decreased by €40.7 million, or 37.2%, from €109.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €68.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. The acquisitions of Argenta and Express Vending contributed €10.5 million of net finance costs for the nine months June 30, 2019. Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals over the period, our net financing costs for the nine months June 30, 2019, would have decreased by €51.2 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to foreign exchange gains on intercompany investments that are not eliminated upon consolidation of intra-group balances. _Income Taxes_ Income taxes decreased by €5.6 million, or 76.7%, from €7.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2018, to €1.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019. This was primarily due to higher income tax expenses in Sweden, driven by accruals for non-deductible tax relating to previous years, and higher tax expenses in Italy primarily driven by differences in timing of accrued taxes, which decreased our income tax benefits. 74 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

This increase was primarily due to the impact of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition in Spain, the Argenta Acquisition in Italy and to a lesser extent the Express Vending Acquisition in the UK. This increase was partly offset by the results of Selecta’s legacy operations in the UK where we are currently implementing our turnaround plans. Revenue in our Central region increased by €111.6 million, or 23.4%, from €477.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 to €589.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by the impact of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition in France, and organic growth in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This increase was partly offset by the results of Selecta’s legacy operations in France where we are currently implementing our turnaround plans. Revenue in our North region increased by €230.2 million, or 124.1%, from €185.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, to €415.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily 75 ----- due to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition driving growth in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway and Finland. Excluding the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, we achieved organic growth in all countries, in particular in Belgium, Norway and Denmark. _Vending Fee_ Vending fee increased by €66.8 million, or 75.1%, from €88.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 to €155.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending. _Materials and Consumables Used_ Expenses for materials and consumables used increased by €245.4 million, or 100.6%, from €244.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 to €489.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, which was partly offset by €4.7 million due to the disposal of legacy Selecta Finland. _Employee Benefits Expense_ Employee benefits expense increased by €188.0 million, or 82.2%, from €228.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, to €416.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, which was partly offset by the disposal of legacy Selecta Finland. _Depreciation and Amortization Expense_ Depreciation and amortization expense increased by €89.6 million, or 96.1%, from €93.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, to €182.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Pelican Rouge, Argenta, and Express Vending, which was partly offset by the disposal of legacy Selecta Finland. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by €81.5 million, or 57.6%, from €141.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, to €223.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2018.

This increase was primarily due to an increase in interest on other loans and refinancing costs, partly offset by lower foreign exchange losses in the year September 30, 2018 as compared with the year ended September 30, 2017. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by €14.8 million, or 197.3%, from €7.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 to €22.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2018.

This increase was primarily due to the effects of the Pelican Rouge Acquisition in Spain, and an increase of 21.7% in Germany compared to the previous year as a result of the increased sales from the Deutsche Bahn contract, and trade sales from Shell gas stations. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of €4.7 million in private sales in Switzerland where new business gains were below expectation. Sales in the Swiss public segment, however, increased slightly due to the upgrades implemented in PoS, which were fitted with telemetry, cashless payment options, and brighter new displays. Revenue in our North region decreased by €10.8 million, or 7.7%, from €140.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €129.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the disposal of our operations in the Baltic countries, which contributed €13.3 million of revenue to the Group in 2016. This decrease was partially offset by the positive performance of our Starbucks on-the-go locations in gas stations in Denmark. Revenue in our France region increased by €7.3 million, or 3.9%, from €184.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €191.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to 77 ----- an increase in sales from PoS in public spaces, specifically train stations. This growth was partially offset by a decline in the private sales due to the removal of low-performing PoS from the PoS park. Revenue in our West region increased by €14.4 million, or 13.3%, from €107.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €122.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to additional revenue resulting from the Pelican Rouge Acquisition. Consistent sales growth throughout the year at gas stations in the Netherlands also contributed to this increase, which were partially offset by decreased private sales in the UK. _Materials and Consumables Used_ Expenses for materials and consumables used increased by €12.9 million, or 5.6%, from €231.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to €244.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, which contributed €15.7 million to our material and consumables used from September 7, 2017 to September 30, 2017. Without giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, expenses for materials and consumables would have decreased by €2.8 million, or 1.2%, driven by the disposal of Selecta’s operations in three Baltic countries completed on March 14, 2017, which accounted for €6.2 million of this expense in the previous year. _Employee Benefits Expense_ Employee benefits expense decreased by €5.5 million, or 2.3%, from €234.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €228.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of FTEs in all four regions (other than Germany in the Central region), which contributed to employee expense savings. FTE reductions were implemented for both field-force and administrative staff, notably IT as a consequence of the outsourcing of the IT infrastructure. The Pelican Rouge Acquisition accounted for €12.6 million of employee benefits expense from September 7, 2017, to September 30, 2017, and Selecta’s operations in the Baltics countries accounted for €1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016. Without giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Baltics disposal, employee benefit expense decreased by 7.0%. _Depreciation and Amortization Expense_ Depreciation and amortization expense increased by €1.2 million, or 1.3%, from €92.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €93.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, which contributed €4.1 million to our depreciation and amortization expense from September 7, 2017, to September 30, 2017. Without giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Baltics disposal, depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by €2.9 million, or 3.1%, primarily as a result of a reduction to the PoS park, compared to the previous year. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by €24.2 million, or 11.7%, from €206.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €230.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and integration related advisory costs. In addition, IT outsourcing and ERP development expenses contributed €5.3 million to our other operating expenses. Additionally, vending fees also increased by €3.4 million to €88.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, due to an increase in public sales. Vending fees, as a percentage of public revenue, increased by 0.5%. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs increased by €17.9 million, or 20.9%, from €85.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 to €103.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a €4.9 million increase in non-cash interest charge on shareholder loans, financing transaction costs directly attributable to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, and foreign exchange losses. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by €3.1 million, or 70.5%, from €4.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €7.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a change in fair value of derivative financial instruments. 78 ----- _Income Taxes_ Income taxes decreased by €1.1 million, or 21.6%, from €5.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2016, to €4.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to the consolidation of Selecta headquarters in Switzerland, which led to lower income taxes and higher tax savings.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Without giving effect to acquisitions and disposals over the period, our net capital expenditure for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, would have increased by €13.1 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to increased investments in France following a period of underinvestment in the legacy Pelican Rouge entities, as well as ERP development expenses and new business gains in the on-the-go segments, predominantly in the Netherlands and Belgium. 81 ----- Net capital expenditures increased by €43.0 million, or 61.0%, from €70.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2017, to €113.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018.

This decrease was primarily attributable to various small and medium acquisitions in 2016. We estimate that we will require gross capital expenditures of approximately €100 million per year on PoS to support our current PoS park and revenue levels, in addition to capital expenditure for vehicles, IT and other equipment, of which approximately €20 million are expected to be financed through finance leases. In addition, we believe that we will require approximately €6 million of PoS gross capital expenditures to support each additional per cent of revenue growth. Our estimates with respect to future capital expenditure requirements may vary based on changes in our product, concept and segment mix. As our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on different capital intensity in different business segments, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to new business, levels of capital expenditure funded through new PoS versus refurbished PoS and specific initiatives to develop telemetry and cashless payment technologies, among other factors, we cannot assure you that our level of capital expenditure will not increase significantly in the future.

Due to our large geographic presence and large base of customers, we are not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on our trade receivables and have no significant exposure to credit risk with any single counterparty. In addition, due the nature of our operations, a significant portion of our revenue is received in cash.

Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to cash flows generated and used in working capital and from financing activities, particularly by servicing our debt, in terms of both interest and capital, and our payment obligations relating to our ordinary business activities. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring our expected cash flows and working capital levels and ensuring that adequate borrowing facilities are maintained. We have several thresholds and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for using derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency without the approval of our Chief Financial Officer. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency exposures without the approval of our Chief Financial Officer. Wherever possible, we require that subsidiaries repatriate all their excess cash and bank balances to Group finance companies to allow the Group to ensure that adequate funds are made available across the Group as necessary.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of operations whose functional currency is not the euro in our financial statements which are presented in euro. Previously, in order to minimize our exposure to translation risk, we had established the borrowings and related interest payments in the four main currencies in which we operate, namely EUR, CHF, GBP and SEK, in order to effect a natural hedge between our income and interest expenses. As of June 30, 2019 €1,163 million of our Existing Notes and our borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were denominated in EUR, 225 million in CHF and 34 million in GBP, and changes in foreign exchange rates will therefore give rise to foreign exchange exposure.

Some of these fluctuations can be passed on to customers through price increases in line with contractual conditions. In order to manage risks from fluctuations in commodities prices, we secure the requirements for green bean for periods of up to six months by instructing the relevant supplier to source the required green beans to cover certain production lots at a specific price. With certain strategic suppliers, we enter into longer-term agreements with agreed price adjustment mechanisms that reflect developments in commodity prices. We periodically assess the economic impact of hedging coffee bean prices but consider the hedging cost too high to make hedging financially attractive. However, while we do not enter into hedging instruments with respect to coffee prices, coffee volumes are committed with suppliers between one and six months in advance depending on current green bean coffee prices and expectations of future price development. 83 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

This increase was primarily due to the harmonization of vending fees across the 89 ----- Group, which was completed during the year ended September 30, 2018, and resulted in an alignment of reporting practices between legacy Selecta entities and the integrated entities of Pelican Rouge and Argenta. We harmonized our reporting practices based on reporting standards applicable to our business models. This harmonization of vending fees resulted in an increase in Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) for the year ended September 30, 2018, of €25.8 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, with a positive impact on our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in certain countries, mainly in Switzerland, France and the UK, which was partly offset by a negative impact on our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in Italy.

Our operations in Spain benefitted from the development of new concepts and higher daily revenue per PoS across all business channels, whereas growth in sales in Italy was supported by the development of new concepts, bolt-on acquisitions and improved daily revenue per PoS in the workplace channel. This increase was partially offset by lower sales in the UK due to the legacy Pelican Rouge business and customer retention challenges in the first part of the year ended September 30, 2018. - _North. Our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the North region for the year ended September 30, 2018, increased by €14.4 million (without giving effect to harmonization of vending fees) compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth in Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Denmark, mainly from an increase in trading sales and, to a lesser extent, successful rollouts in our semi-public business in Sweden and Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth in or public business in Belgium and Denmark. - _Central. Our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in the Central region for the year ended September 30, 2018, increased by €5.6 million (without giving effect to harmonization of vending fees) compared to the year ended September 30, 2017.

We achieved synergies and cost savings of €24 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018.

This increase was also due to an increase of €2.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, due to bolt-on acquisitions, mainly in Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Germany and the UK. Below is a discussion of drivers for the increase in our Adjusted EBITDA (CS &CC) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018: - _South, UK & Ireland. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, increased by €5.3 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in revenue in Spain and from Express Vending, as well as cost savings and rightsizing personnel and overhead expenses reductions in the UK. - _North. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the North region for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, increased by €15.8 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to higher revenue across the region over the period, including from our roaster business which benefitted from favorable coffee prices. - _Central. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the Central region for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, decreased by €4.7 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was due to our results of operations in France, where our Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, declined by €8.5 million compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2018. This decrease was partly offset by our results in Switzerland driven by higher revenue and operational excellence initiatives. - _Headquarters. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) at our Headquarters for the nine months ended June 30, 2019, increased by €1.5 million compared to nine months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to our leaner corporate structure.

We achieved reduction of operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2018, compared to the year ended September 30, 2017, as a result of our cost savings initiatives.

Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the South, UK & Ireland region for the year ended September 30, 2017, decreased by €2.5 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to higher personnel costs following machine park increases in Italy and higher national labor contract rates, which offset the performance of our business in Italy. To a lesser extent, this decrease was also attributable to the performance of our business in the UK, which was largely offset by personnel and operating costs savings with respect to Selecta and Pelican Rouge entities in the UK. - _North. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the North region for the year ended September 30, 2017, increased by €0.9 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the performance of our business in the Netherlands and Denmark, which was largely offset by a decrease in profit in Sweden due to the increased use of customer-owned machines which lead to lower service fees. - _Central. Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) in the Central region for the year ended September 30, 2017, increased by €6.0 million compared to the year ended September 30, 2016.

We estimate that the Unattended SSR Market is a €15 billion market in the Focus Countries. Through the continued development and expansion of new concepts, such as MicroMarkets, we are increasingly involved in the broader addressable convenience market (the “Addressable Market”), which spans the Unattended SSR Market, as well as the broader convenience market with other retail formats (e.g. street stalls, kiosks and convenience stores), and has a market size of €42 billion in the Focus Countries. The Addressable Market can also be categorized into the two segments of workplace and on-the-go. Within the Addressable Market, in addition to Unattended SSR Market, the workplace segment includes cafeterias and the on-the-go segment includes convenience foodservice and packaged foods. The workplace segment aims at improving the experience of people at work, for example by enhancing employee engagement, satisfaction, and productivity in the work environment. Through vending and office coffee services, unattended self-service retailers, such as us, service private businesses and corporate offices in places generally not accessible by other retail formats. Unattended self-service retailers that enter into three to five year contacts with corporate customers receive proceeds through sale of goods from impulse and coffee machines, servicing fees and revenues from sales of coffee beans and other consumables. We pay rent to selected large private customers based on percentage of sales, a flat fee, or a combination thereof. The workplace segment accounted for approximately 36% (by value) of the Addressable Market in the Focus Countries in 2017. In addition to self-service PoS, this segment includes cafeteria and capsules, whereby cafeterias include hot drinks and snacks, but exclude warm lunches, and capsules include machines and capsules provided by the employer in small and medium office environments. The on-the-go segment aims to enhance the consumer experience by providing tailored coffee and snacking offerings in public (e.g. train and gas stations or airports) and semi-public locations (e.g. hospitals and public schools). Contracts typically range between five to ten years. We receive proceeds from the sales of goods from PoS and pay rent to customers based on a percentage of sales, a flat fee, or a combination thereof. The on-the-go segment accounted for approximately 64% (by value) of the Addressable Market in the Focus Countries in 2017. In addition to self-service PoS, this segment includes convenience foodservice and packaged food retailing. Convenience foodservice includes products prepared for take-away/ready-to-eat, hot drinks (especially coffee), as well as value-add drinks sold in street stalls, kiosks and specialized coffee shops. Packaged food retailing includes packaged food, confectionary items, snacks and soft drinks sold in convenience stores and forecourt retailers. Within the Unattended SSR Market, approximately 85% (by value) is in the workplace segment in the Focus Countries in 2017. This segment includes PoS located in private businesses and is comprised of (i) fully operated PoS offering hot drinks and impulse items (cold drinks and snacks) (i.e., private self-service retail), and (ii) coffee machines (often table-top) operated (cleaned and refilled) by the employer located in private businesses (i.e., OCS). The remainder of the Unattended SSR Market (approximately 15% by value) in the Focus Countries in 2017 lies in the on-the-go segment. This segment includes the sale of hot drinks and impulse items at public locations (e.g. train stations, gas stations) and semi-public locations (e.g. hospitals, universities). The trade segment provides a full suite of services and coffee and coffee related products to customers. Selecta receives proceeds from the sales of roasted coffee beans, PoS, other goods, and third party technical servicing. 97 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

226_2,Offerings 2019.md,1346,UNAUDITED NON-GAAP AGGREGATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1346.33,Overview of Self-service Retail Business Models,1346.33.1,,"Business models can be differentiated depending on the level of services provided. Additionally, some selfservice retail operators offer the sale of ingredients (such as coffee beans, ground coffee, milk (powder) and sugar), machines and machine parts as well as technical services. The provided level of service typically varies with PoS density which determines profitability levels. The workplace segment with larger companies (with more than 250 employees) typically provides for large scale full-service contracts. Self-operated PoS are typically prevalent in smaller companies (with 250 or fewer employees) in the workplace segment, as well as at gas stations in the on-the-go segment that are too remote to be fully operated by a self-service retail operator. The detailed overview of business models is as follows: Full Service Model** The self-service retail operator owns or leases and is responsible for the procurement and placement of PoS, stocking and restocking of items, and ongoing maintenance. The self-service retail operator pays a fee (e.g. based on sold cups, or a flat fee) to the B2B contractor. End consumers typically pay for convenience food and beverage at the PoS, with sales directly collected from the self-service retail operator on a consumption basis. Partial Service Model** The self-service retail operator provides the PoS and ingredients and receives a monthly fee, with customers responsible for cleaning and refilling the PoS themselves. Supply/Technical Model** The self-service retail operator sells machines (both replacements and to new customers) and ingredients to customers without any service element and offers technical service contracts for machines. As these business models all require self-service retail operators to make regular visits to customer sites, maintaining dense clusters of customers in conjunction with dynamic route-planning for merchandizers and technicians visiting those sites are key for profitability. Telemetry devices installed in PoS provide self-service retail operators with real-time data from the PoS, which is then used to plan bespoke routes to PoS that require a visit, ensure no stock-outs and reduce time needed for merchandisers as with telemetry they already have pre-kitted sets. We operate across all three types of business models described above with a focus on the full service model, which together with the partial service model accounted for 84% of our revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018, and the supply/technical model accounted for the remaining 16%. Self-service retail services are typically provided to private, public and semi-public customers. Private customers generally operate within private or relatively restricted locations such as offices and factories. Public customers have properties that are generally located in more widely accessible locations such as railway stations, and airports. PoS are also provided to customers in semi-public locations such as universities, schools, health clubs, and hospitals. We focus on three types of PoS: (i) hot beverages (predominantly coffee, hot chocolate, tea) free standing PoS and table top machines; (ii) cold beverages (cans and bottles) in closed front PoS; and (iii) snacks, cold drinks, fresh foods and non-food products in glass front PoS. While all of these products are available through several other distribution channels (e.g. supermarkets, coffee shops), PoS offer a value proposition focused around convenience for both consumers and customers at locations where other distribution channels might not be available. Specifically, we provide consumers with “24/7” access to products at particularly convenient points of sale in private, public and semi-public locations. Furthermore, in the workplace segment we also operate MicroMarkets with an enlarged product portfolio on a much larger area which provide us with an additional route to market which is gaining traction across Europe. Self-service retail operators such as Selecta typically earn revenue from their customers via long-term contracts which provide a high degree of revenue visibility due to stable consumption patterns of consumers. While the term of each contract varies, private contracts are typically for a period of three to five years, and public contracts are typically for a period of five to ten years. Self-service retail operators generate revenue based on their specific business models and the range of services offered. Illustratively, a self-service retail provider operating within a private setting with a full service business model would earn revenues from the sale of products with prices agreed at the outset of the contract and adjusted based on a mechanism such as a price index. 99 ----- Operators generally also generate fixed service/maintenance fees from their public and private customers. Volume-based rebates are typically agreed with larger multi-site customers. PoS in private settings operate either on a free vend or pay vend basis. On a free vend basis, the customer subsidizes the cost for consumers which then do not need to make payments themselves. Alternatively, on a pay vend basis, consumers purchase items using cash or a form of cashless payment system without any subsidies from the customer. Products are sold in public settings on a pay vend basis and providers are typically free to set and adapt product selling prices, but a provider typically pays a fee (rent) to the customer for occupying the customer’s premises.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The rise in domestic trips per capita is leading to increased number of encounters with PoS and stores selling convenience products at public locations, increasing the demand for on-the-go convenience products. Across all product categories and countries, surveys indicate that consumers on-the-go value the quick transaction nature and convenient location of self-service retail vis-à-vis other retailing formats. _Increased Consumer Spend on Out-of-Home Food and Beverage_ Out-of-home consumer spending on food and beverage items has been rising across each of the Focus Countries. Between 2012 and 2014, out-of-home consumer spending increased at a CAGR of 1.8%. This growth has intensified between 2014 and 2017 to 4.2%, driven primarily by large increases across the Focus Countries. OC&C estimates that this spending growth will continue between 2018 and 2022. Increases in impulse purchases, in particular from public points of sale have predominantly contributed to this growth. _Available Locations_ Although the number of public locations has remained stable, there has been an increase in the number of locations where operators can place self-service PoS, including offices. This increased availability also increases consumer exposure to self-service retail points of sale, which drives growth in impulse purchases. _Premiumization_ An increase in premium coffee drinking culture is driving on-the-go and workplace segment growth. Furthermore, the premiumization trend (especially in coffee), in combination with a trend toward customized products are driving average prices of premium food and beverages.

New trends and economic conditions in most Focus Countries have contributed to increased consumer spending particularly on out-of-home food and beverages, an overall increased workforce, and increased average working hours. Consumer trends toward premium coffee experiences and premium healthy cold drinks have also contributed to driving average prices for such products above the inflation rate. Moreover, the continuing shift toward convenience in most markets and the overall increase in time spent in transit (e.g. commuting, business trips) have contributed to expanding the Addressable Market.

Groups of key competitors in the Unattended SSR Market are elaborated on below. 106 ----- _Traditional Self-service Retail Specialists_ Our main competitors are traditional self-service retail operators. The European Unattended SSR Market is largely mature and is characterized by a large number of industry participants. The industry is fragmented with few players of national scale and a long tail of small players per market, indicating the relatively low barriers to entry at a local level but high barriers to scale. Self-service retail operators offer their services across workplace and on-the-go segments. In the workplace segment, they focus on larger businesses (blue and white collar) with high throughput and multiple PoS at one location given the high density required for efficiency in refilling. In the on-the-go segment, self-service retail operators offer convenience products at locations where footfall for laborintensive formats is too low, retail space is insufficient, or opening hours limit other formats. Given the high density required to operate PoS portfolio profitably, the Unattended SSR Market has relatively high barriers to scale. There is a limited set of players comparable to us in terms of brand, scale, product width and multi-regional presence. Regional specialists are competitive locally, but have a limited ability to serve national/international customers (e.g. gas stations, public train stations) or offer a full product range. We believe that the domestic key competitors in the Focus Countries include local players, such as IVS (mainly in Italy), Daltys (only in France) and Maas (only in the Netherlands). _Contract Caterers and Facility Management Providers_ Contract caterers and facility management providers can offer a one-stop service at a cost advantage, with PoS typically being operated by a customer’s own cafeteria staff. However, complex machine operations typically require trained technicians, leading to the credibility of caterers being increasingly questioned, e.g. in terms of refilling fresh food and of costs and expenses. As a result, increasingly more, contract caterers and facility management providers are partnering with self-service retail specialists to provide these services for a fee. Key players include Aramark in Belgium and Germany, Compass in the UK and Elior in Spain. _Vertically Integrated Self-service Retail Providers_ Vertically Integrated self-service retail providers represent a small group of mostly coffee and soft drinks producers, who as an extension to their core drinks production operations also ventured into Unattended SSR Market. However, they did so mostly as a brand extension and as a means of direct access and communication with final consumers. As a result their product offering is usually limited or in some cases strictly restricted to their own product portfolio (e.g. coffee or soft drinks). While they occupy a portion of the market, Vertically Integrated self-service retail providers cannot fully compete as traditional self-service retail specialists, who provide a considerably wider portfolio of brands, product offering and capabilities. Key players include JDE, Dallmayr and Lavazza Professional (former Mars drinks). Coffee towers are also in this group and are operated by coffee shop chains like Costa. Competitive pressures on traditional self-service retail specialists from coffee towers is limited to urban areas. One of the key competitors is Costa Express in the United Kingdom (now part of Coca-Cola, which is a competitor for our coffee offering in the UK, but we are still servicing their machines and distributing their cold beverages in our PoS). _Other Formats_ Other formats typically offer a wider range of food and beverages, including healthy and fresh options. These formats typically require high footfall to be profitable and compensate for high fees. Compared to these formats, self-service retail operators can maintain better proximity to consumers, in particular during short changing times (e.g. train station platforms). Key competitors include Tesco Express, REWE to Go, 7-Eleven, and Relay. 107 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

We held the number one or number two market position based on revenue in 2017 in our ten core markets of Belgium, France, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We served over ten million consumers per day via more than 3,800 routes as of June 30, 2019. We operate in a highly fragmented market, which provides growth opportunities, both organically and through accretive acquisitions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, we generated a revenue of €1,580.8 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of €267.7 million, and we would have generated an Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) of €1,604.7 million and an Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) of €271.2 million, achieving 3.8% Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) growth compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, and 18.9% Adjusted EBITDA (CS & CC) margins.

We also cater to the impulse-based consumer purchases with offerings of snacks, including healthy options, cold drinks and fresh food sold through traditional impulse PoS as well as our recently introduced MicroMarkets concept. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) as a percentage of the types of items we sell amounted to 56% for coffee and hot drinks, 29% for impulse items, and 15% for other. 108 ----- We serve customers and generate revenue in the workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business channels further discussed below: (*) Adjusted Revenue (CS & CS) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. Our business model covers the full value chain of the coffee and convenience food Unattended SSR Market, from green bean roasting to brewing to the consumer’s cup, and we have developed industry leading coffee know-how, capabilities, and expertise in connection with these processes. We roast and produce both instant and full bean coffee, which we use in our own PoS, our customers’ PoS and also sell to third parties, and as such, our roaster in Dordrecht, the Netherlands, is an important driver of our coffee expertise. We have created a strong portfolio of high-quality coffee brands, such as our in-house developed Pelican Rouge brand and its craftsmanship image that caters for growing number of consumers increasingly looking for this attribute. Our Pelican Rouge brand complements our premium coffee offering in partnership with Lavazza and Starbucks. We leverage our technology capabilities and data collection from PoS to provide relevant products, gauge consumer preferences and maximize revenue opportunities, which improve consumer experience and customer satisfaction. We also provide cleaning, maintenance, and technical support services which can be customized based on individual customer needs and preferences, even when we do not enter into a full self-service retail service arrangement with the customer. In addition to our unattended self-service and coffee roasting operations, we also sell coffee and machines, including to hotels, restaurants and cafés, and machine parts and products independent of self-service retail service arrangements. Due to the predictable nature of our business and the length of our customer contracts, we believe we are able to achieve high revenue visibility. We benefit from diversified revenue streams secured by multi-year contracts derived from a large and loyal customer base across private and public sector in 2018 and a 100% retention rate with our top ten customers over that period. As of June 30, 2019, we estimate that our average private customer contract term is three to five years, and our average public customer contract term is five to ten years. Moreover, the maintenance and cleaning services we offer as part of our self-service retail services provide us with an additional source of high margin revenues. Innovation and technology are also key drivers of our success, and we benefit from our track record of innovation leadership both in terms of technology upgrades such as cashless payment, touchscreen user interfaces and telemetry, as well as in terms of unattended self-service retail concepts, such as MicroMarkets, to drive daily revenue per PoS and open new routes-to-market. Since our founding in Switzerland in 1957, we have grown organically as well as through acquisitions. On September 7, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the Pelican Rouge Group, which increased our presence in nine of the 15 markets in which we operated at that time, making us the market leader by revenue in France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Belgium. In addition, on February 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of the 109 ----- Argenta Group, a leading unattended self-service retail operator in Italy, which became our 16[th] market. On August 17, 2018, we acquired Express Vending, a leading UK supplier of premium unattended self-service retail services, bolstering our position as the leading European provider of route-based unattended self-service coffee and impulse and convenience food offerings, including MicroMarkets, and further consolidated our leading position in the United Kingdom. Express Vending is at the forefront of MicroMarket design and deployment in the UK. Express Vending’s Express HUB brand stores, with open plan refreshment areas, an extensive product range and self-scan kiosks. As a result of these acquisitions, our innovation and technology leadership, and through upgrades of our business, operating systems and corporate culture, we have achieved a leading position in Europe as a routebased unattended self-service retail provider with strong know-how and capabilities in providing coffee and impulse offerings across a range of workplace/private, on-the-go/public and trading business channels. We had average market shares ranging between 10% and 15% in our core markets for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to approximately 6% of the European market over the same period in 2016, and we served over ten million consumers for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, compared to approximately 6 million for the year ended September 30, 2016.

Within the Addressable Market, we focus on the Unattended SSR Market which has a market size of approximately €16 billion in our 16 countries of operations, of which approximately €15 billion arises in the Focus Countries. Our Addressable Market has grown at a CAGR of 2.1% between 2012 and 2017, reaching a total value of approximately €40.5 billion in the Focus Countries and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% reaching €47.1 billion by 2022. This trend has been driven by a positive macro-economic backdrop with an increase in GDP and stable employment levels, which have led to increased spending in the workplace channel. In addition, we believe that an increasing preference for drinking premium coffee and out-of-home consumption, increased mobility, and the desire for easy availability of healthy and quality products is driving consumers towards our pan-European on-the-go self-service retail offerings.

For example, we are able to offer consumers a premium hot drinks experience, both in the workplace and on-the-go through our long-standing partnership with Starbucks. As of June 30, 2019, we have installed approximately 1,964 Starbucks concepts across Europe, and the price of a coffee sold in our Starbucks on-the-go concept is between 20% to 90% higher than a coffee sold in traditional self-service PoS, and such trends for premium brands support our profitability. Similarly, through our partnership with Lavazza we offer our customers and consumers additional options for a premium coffee experience.

We believe that our adjusted revenue (on a constant scope and constant currency basis) for the year ended September 30, 2018, was approximately 3.5 times that of the second largest market player. As of June 30, 2019, we had operations in 16 European countries, which covered approximately 95% of European GDP and contain approximately 78% of the European population. In 2016, we served over six million consumers per day, which we have nearly doubled to more than ten million consumers served per day. We held the number one or number two market position based on revenue in 2017 in our ten core markets, and we estimate that this market data is still accurate as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Our sales in these markets represented 90.7% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, we operated a network of more than 475,000 active coffee and convenience food and beverage self-service PoS, approximately 2.5 times the number of PoS of the second largest market player. With regards to our suppliers, we believe we are the largest machine buyer in the highly fragmented Unattended SSR Market, making us the customer of choice for our suppliers, which in turn provides us with competitively priced procurement arrangements on, amongst other, a wide selection of market leading machines. The Unattended SSR Market is characterized by fragmentation and intense competition on a local level. We are one of the very few operators on a pan-European level, which increases the appeal of our brands and offerings with consumers and of our services and concepts with customers, as compared with our smaller competitors. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our Adjusted Revenue (CS & CC) in each of our three geographic segments was split relatively evenly with Central accounting for 37%, North accounting for 26%, and South, UK & Ireland accounting for 37%. This is in contrast to the second largest market player, over three quarters of whose revenue in its last financial year was derived from Italy alone. In addition, the breadth of our product portfolio enables us to better address consumers’ preferences across geographic segments, including evolving market trends, and to provide a one-stop shop offering for our customers. Additionally, our established brands and unique concepts differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to secure attractive and comprehensive contracts with a variety of suppliers and premium brands, which help us maintain our high market share.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Innovation and technology improve the consumer experience, enhance operational excellence and allow us to further expand our route-based business model. Cashless payment systems and digital touchscreen user interfaces that we are rolling out across our PoS park enhance the consumer experience by providing additional accessibility and simplicity of use, thereby driving number of sales and average transaction size compared to cash transactions. As of June 30, 2019, daily revenue per PoS equipped with cashless technology are on average 10% to 20% higher than PoS that only accept cash, and the average transaction value of products sold from cashless PoS is between 5% to 10% higher, making cashless payment options an important driver in increasing sales from existing PoS. As of June 30, 2019, 95% of our public PoS deployed cashless technology. Telemetry in our PoS allows us to better adjust our pricing and product offerings to drive sales and to more efficiently monitor inventory levels and determine maintenance requirements, which increases our route efficiency and operational excellence, and thereby improves service quality and customer retention.

We deploy capital expenditures in order to retain and acquire new customers and do so by acquiring new PoS and refurbishing our existing PoS in order to enhance returns on investment. Capital expenditure for new PoS and refurbishment of existing PoS of the Group typically achieves a ROI ranging from 100% to 250%, depending on the country, with the highest returns in the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland. We have consistently achieved efficiencies stemming from PoS park rationalization (which includes margin management, relocating PoS to more profitable locations, and decreasing the types of PoS in use) and refurbishment.

These contracts, however, are very lucrative to our business as these public spaces experience high traffic during all hours in the day, including late nights when most other food and beverage stores are closed for business. For example, we were able to grow our revenues in Germany as a result of a public contract with Deutsche Bahn to place PoS throughout rail stations in the West and South of Germany. Although the number of Selecta PoS used for public areas only represents 4% of our PoS as of June 30, 2019, it accounts for 18% of our revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. - The trading channel, which is comprised of sales of machines and products, including coffee roasted in our roasting facility, as well as the provision of technical and hygienic support to customers.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

These machines serve a wide variety of coffee and coffee specialty drinks as well as freshly brewed tea, hot chocolate and soups. In 2009, we introduced our own brand coffee blends under the Miofino brand to complement our range of hot drink self-service PoS. Following the Pelican Rouge Acquisition, we have increased our range of own brand coffee offerings under the name Pelican Rouge. Both Pelican Rouge and Miofino coffee offerings include mild, medium, and bold blends as well as decaffeinated and organic and fair trade-certified blends, including instant, roasted whole bean and ground coffee options. Specific Pelican Rouge and Miofino coffee blend availability varies according to country. Table top machines are primarily targeted at the private self-service retail segment, such as offices, but are also frequently located in restaurants and cafés and in certain specific public locations such as gas stations. Free 117 ----- standing PoS, in contrast, are primarily suited for public locations in high-traffic areas such as airports and train and subway stations. We offer table top and free-standing models on either free vend basis, where the customer covers the cost of the products and users do not need to pay at the PoS, or pay vend basis, where consumers purchase items using coins or a form of cashless payment systems. See “—Payment Options.” Our wide selection of hot drink self-service PoS allows customers to select the right machine for their needs based on additional factors, such as cup capacity and the number of available drink selections. For example, our Ferrara coffee selfservice machine has capacity for 100 cups per day, can vend a variety of coffee specialties, in addition to freshly brewed tea and hot chocolate. It also features an integrated color touch screen that allows users to select and customize their drinks by adding sugar or increasing or decreasing the strength of drinks to taste, and nutritional and allergy information is available via the touch screen to help consumers make informed choices. In addition, we provide a range of premium hot drink self-service PoS through the following partnerships: - _Starbucks: We introduced Starbucks on-the-go PoS for public spaces in 2013. These PoS feature premium coffee self-service machines manufactured by Franke that include space for two types of coffee beans, offer a wide variety of coffee specialty drinks and allow users to choose from three drink sizes depending on the beverage selection. Additionally, flexible payment options are available and each PoS can be configured with a payment module. On January 12, 2015, we entered into a partnership with Starbucks governed by an exclusive contract and, in August 2018, we signed a new agreement with Starbucks. This agreement is valid until July 2021 and provides us with the license to develop and operate Starbucks premium self-serve solutions, including Starbucks on-the-go for public and semi-public channels and Starbucks workplace for private channels, in 13 markets in Europe. Under this agreement, we market, sell and operate the concepts while Starbucks provides all the ingredients, taking into account a profit element. We earn the revenue and the profit through the sale of the products and applicable maintenance and service charges. For the year ended September 30, 2018, sales from Starbucks concepts accounted for €61.6 million of our revenue, which was a 7.9% increase compared to the same period in 2017. We installed 168 additional Starbucks concepts in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and, as of June 30, 2019, we had over 1,964 Starbucks concepts in 11 countries, increasing from 1,151, 1,490 and 1,796 PoS as of September 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. - _Lavazza: We introduced our range of Lavazza self-service PoS in 2017 for private and public customers. Lavazza PoS can be ordered for an array of spaces from small or large offices to gas stations and major public transportation hubs. Our partnership with Lavazza is governed by a framework contract that we entered into on December 22, 2016, with an indefinite term set to expire 60 days from the expiry of the last lease agreement under such framework agreement. Under this framework agreement, we derive our revenue from (i) sales of products used in connection with leased self-service PoS owned by Lavazza and (ii) sales of Lavazza coffee from our PoS. We installed 3,654 new Lavazza PoS selling Lavazza coffee in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and, as of June 30, 2019, we operated over 15,637 PoS selling Lavazza coffee across eight countries. In the long-term, we plan on installing approximately 40,000 PoS throughout our markets. Our range of Lavazza PoS can be combined with our full ranges of services and we have launched our telesales of Lavazza coffee capsules for table-top machines in eight countries. Lavazza telesales are conducted from our call centers, and generally target offices where table-top machines that use Lavazza coffee capsules may be operated. See “—Machines, Machine Parts and Products.” We also enter into alternative lease arrangements with Lavazza whereby Lavazza directly buys the machine, and we receive the revenue generated by such PoS less a commission withheld by Lavazza. For the year ended September 30, 2018, sales from Lavazza PoS accounted for €61.1 million of our revenue, which was a 200% increase compared to the same period in 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

For example, each of our Santa Fe touch and Santa Fe XL machine models are equipped to vend snacks, confectionary items, cans, bottles and tetra packs, and their flexible layouts allow for easy reconfiguration to accommodate changes in product offering or layout, i.e. snacks and cold beverage combination in the warm months and snacks and hot beverage combination in the colder months. Through the electronic shelf labels and the touchscreen of the Santa Fe Touch, we can ensure accurate and up-to-date price, allergy, and nutrition information is provided to the consumers. We generally offer customers a standard assortment of brand name and top sellers snacks and beverages, but the product mix can also be tailored to the customer’s needs to reflect, for example, particular regional tastes in snack foods or drinks as well as locally-sourced items. Our newest glass-fronted cold drinks machines, such as the St. Tropez, include a modern cooling system which concentrates the air flow at the front of the shelves in order to provide the next drinks to be dispensed at the optimum temperature, and ensures a shake-free delivery at an ergonomic height. They also feature an integrated robotic lift, which delivers the selected drink to the carousel within ten seconds, and use energy-saving LED lights.

These include employee cash cards and keys, bank cards and credit cards, corporate cashless payment systems and mobile phone payments, including Selecta eWallet, which we introduced in the summer 2018 as a lower cost (to us) alternative to other contactless payment systems, and the Argenta App (described below). Cash card and key options are relatively common among our PoS located in offices or other private points of sale due to the ability to set different prices for different consumers, such as company personnel and visitors. As the growth in the use of alternative payment methods accelerates, credit card and mobile phone payment options are more frequently included in our PoS located at publicly accessible points of sale. We have also started to add alternative payment methods to our paid vend PoS in semi-public and private sites. Cashless payment options help to support sales from PoS and enable higher average spend of consumers than cash transactions. We have, therefore, updated our Selecta app and Selecta eWallet, to function not only as a tool to locate our PoS, but also as a method of payment at certain of our PoS, including all public PoS in Switzerland and approximately 8,000 PoS in Italy. Similarly, in addition to being a cashless method of payment, the Argenta App is designed to feature a variety of promos and a loyalty program to incentivize the repeated use of Argenta’s PoS.

We broadly segregate our customers into workplace and on-the-go customers. Our customers in our North region are predominantly workplace coffee focused, while our Central region customers are on-the-go focused, and our South, UK, and Ireland region customers are predominantly comprised of private customers. We aim to further expand our customer base and, for example, we have recently won or renewed contracts with Madrid Airport in Spain, Amsterdam UMC hospital and the National Police in the Netherlands, Texaco (fuel provider) in Belgium, Volvo (car manufacturer) in Sweden, Welcome Break (motorway services operator) and Coca Cola European Partners in the UK and the Pathé Gaumont Cinema chain in France. For public customers and, to a very limited extent, large private customers, we generally pay vending fees to place our PoS on their premises. Vending fee arrangements include fixed or variable fees (based on a percentage of revenue from vends) as well as a combination of the two. They are based on a number of factors, including tender specifications for public bids, competitive pressure, contract length, offers by competitors, expected revenue, locations and the demographics of the relevant locations. Our extended experience in the self-service retail operator industry provides us with insight to help determine competitive yet prudent vending fee levels. Vending fees are typically higher for countries with a higher share of public PoS in their portfolio, given that these fees refer to the consideration paid to customers for the use of their premises. In addition to originating new customer business, our sales teams coordinate and monitor the renewal of customer contracts and the public tenders in which we participate. Approximately an average of 20% of our contracts are up for renewal each year. In our private self-service retail operations (including our OCS services), typical customer contract terms range from three to five years. Our contracts with public customers are frequently longer, typically ranging from five to ten years. Our customer contracts typically provide us with the exclusive right to install and operate PoS on our customer’s premises, although certain contracts with public customers do not include such exclusivity rights. Our customer contracts generally automatically renew for a period of one or two years at the end of the initial term in the absence of notice of termination. The notice period for termination of customer contracts is typically three or six months for each contracting party. In the event of a breach of contract that has not been remedied within one month from the provision of notice of the breach, our customer contracts commonly allow for termination by the non-breaching party at any time. We believe our reputation for quality products, innovation and customer service has enabled us to form strong and long lasting customer relationships across a broad range of customers. We believe this is also evident in our overall average customer retention rate. We estimate that our retention rate was approximately 95.9% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, without taking into account the Express Vending Acquisition, which is an increase of approximately 1.8% compared to the same period in 2018. 121 ----- In terms of revenue, we maintain a low customer concentration; for example, for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, our top ten customers accounted for 9.0% of our revenue, and no single customer accounted for more than approximately 1.5% of our revenue for the same period.

At a Group level, we incentivize our sales force to focus on increasing turnover contribution margins, contract length, and customer retention. Following the integration of the Pelican Rouge Group and the Argenta Group, we have developed strategic initiatives to increase sales efficiency (particularly in France and in the UK), such as increased focus on customer satisfaction, systematic approach to gathering customer feedback, introduction of training and incentivizing staff based on customer satisfaction and local sales team offering specifically tailored propositions to new customers. We have rolled out a strategic sales acceleration program in Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK as a result of these initiatives. 123 ----- Our private customers frequently come to us through a combination of channels. The Selecta and Pelican Rouge brand names are among the largest self-service retail companies in the market and potential new customers may contact us directly. However, we have structured lead generation processes in place, where leads can be generated from visit to our websites, prospects entered into our CRM tool, incoming calls to our customer service/telesales departments and also sales force cold calling/visits. The main focus of our local marketing teams is lead generation. In addition, larger private companies tender their services and we are usually invited to these tenders. Our cooperation and framework agreements with facility management also provide us with new customers and leads. We have developed for our sales team a central program coordination team with strong local capabilities and support to help harmonize prices in all of our markets. We differentiate prices by applying segmentation and deploying segment specific and location specific price strategies and to monitor and analyzing sales data collected through telemetry, in order to formulate pricing strategies for each category of products in each market, we then focus on price strategies for the top ten popular products in each market. Our telemetry data also allows for a dynamic pricing strategy, which is capable of adapting to consumer reactions in real time. In the business-to-business to consumer space we have implemented margin management on underperforming accounts and systematic annual price increases in addition to price differentiation between brand and non-brand items; in the business-to-business space, we have implemented similar systematic annual price increases, in addition to upselling products such as premium coffee and reducing leakage. We continually aim to provide efficient and effective customer care. Our business operates with the support of service call centers in each country, which accept inbound calls for PoS malfunctions and maintenance issues, and sales call centers, which place outbound calls to generate sales of our OCS and machine products and services. Our relevant call centers’ telephone numbers are displayed on all of our PoS, allowing customers or consumers to directly get in touch with us for a quick resolution of any maintenance or other technical issues. In addition, inbound calls received by customers can be directed to technicians to help customers troubleshoot or resolve technical issues in order to avoid the need for, and time and expense associated with, a site visit. We improved our average of serviced PoS per technician from 264 for the year ended September 30, 2017 (after giving effect to the Pelican Rouge Acquisition and the Argenta Acquisition) to 269 over the same period in 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In general, our lease agreements can be terminated at our option prior to the maturity date, in certain cases with a penalty. We believe that our properties meet our present needs and that they are sufficiently maintained and suitable for their intended use. Additionally, we have started to lease our coffee roasting plant in the Netherlands since September 2019, pursuant to a sale and leaseback transaction in respect of all lands and buildings of our roasting facility.

We depreciate our free-standing hot drink PoS over a period of six years, table top machines over a period of four years, and snack and cold drink PoS over a period of eight years. However, we are generally able to utilize our PoS beyond such four or eight year period, with table top machines lasting up to eight years and snack and cold drink PoS lasting up to 20 years, with the appropriate refurbishment. We continually refurbish and upgrade some of our PoS to extend their useful life. For example, public PoS can be refurbished twice, tripling their useful life. PoS that are not refurbished and redeployed are either sold or scrapped.

As a PoS operator, we are subject to the requirements of a number of EU and national regulations administered by the European Food Safety Authority and national government entities and agencies in the countries in which we operate. The primary EU regulations that relate to our business are EU Regulation 178/2002 and EU Regulation 852/2004. EU Regulation 178/2002 establishes the European Food Safety Authority as well as general principles and requirements of food law in the European Union and procedures in matters of food safety. This regulation is specified, inter alia, by EU Regulation 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules. EU Regulation 852/2004 sets out general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs. Additional regulations include EU Regulation 853/2004, which regulates, among other things, the temperature settings of PoS that stock products 126 ----- made from or containing animal products, such as meats and cheeses, and EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers. As we do not manufacture our own PoS or produce our own products (other than coffee beans sourced from our roasting plant), our daily operations of sourcing and stocking products and cleaning and providing technical maintenance and support on our PoS are impacted by such regulations to a limited extent; however, we have to ensure that the PoS are operated in compliance with applicable law. Moreover, as we continue to source a wide variety of our products in the countries in which the PoS are located, our suppliers are primarily responsible for ensuring that their products meet applicable packaging, nutritional information and other requirements. In the EU countries in which we operate, we have implemented Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) concepts and systems with regard to food hygiene and in accordance with the requirements of EU Regulation 852/2004 and applicable national legislation. Our employees in such countries are trained at least annually to comply with the HACCP procedures. In Switzerland, the handling (i.e., manufacture, processing, storage, transportation, and placing on the market) of foodstuffs and utility articles is governed by a number of laws and regulations aimed at protecting consumers’ health, setting minimal hygiene standards, preventing consumer fraud and mandating minimum nutritional fact information on product labels. The Federal Act on Foodstuffs and Utility Articles of June 20, 2014, as amended (the “FSA”) is the framework legislation in the area of foodstuff and utility articles. The FSA lays down general requirements for the safety, hygiene and labelling of foodstuffs and utility articles, stipulates licensing and reporting requirements for businesses and sets out the powers and duties of the enforcement authorities. A number of implementation ordinances have been enacted by the federal administration under the FSA, further detailing the requirements prescribed by the FSA. One of the main purposes of the FSA and its implementation ordinances was to remove previously existing barriers of trade in the area of foodstuffs and utility articles by aligning Swiss regulations with those of the EU. Accordingly, the Swiss legislation was based on EU Regulation 178/2002 with regard to foodstuffs and EU Product Safety Directive 2001/95 with regard to utility articles. However, certain elements of prior Swiss regulation, e.g., the obligation to indicate the country of production or the origin of ingredients in pre-packaged foodstuffs, have been retained. Self-monitoring is a fundamental component of Swiss food legislation. It means that each company is responsible for complying with the legal requirements. Self-monitoring includes the following elements: (i) ensuring good practice and protection against deception, (ii) applying the HACCP system or its principles, (iii) conducting product samplings and analysis, (iv) safeguarding traceability, (v) withdrawal and recall of products in case of potential hazard, and (vi) documentation duties. The employers’ and employees’ associations GastroSuisse, hotelleriesuisse, CafetierSuisse and the Swiss industry Association for Hospitality, Home and Community Catering have promulgated a guideline on Good Practices in the Hospitality Industry (the “Guideline GVG”), which was approved by the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (the “FSVO”) on September 21, 2018. The Guideline GVG covers all relevant aspects of food law and sets out the procedure and scope of self-regulation. It sets the standard for best practice for operating the business in compliance with the law. By virtue of the approval of the FSVO, the Guideline GVG has a binding character and applies to our business.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

On July 13, 2018, SNCF Mobilites initiated a claim against Selecta SAS and Selecta AG for unpaid invoices under a contract dated July 1, 2014, between Selecta and SNCF, the French railway company, for a term of eleven years. Pursuant to this agreement, we place our PoS at SNCF’s train stations where travelers may make purchases in exchange for a monthly vending fee. During April through June of 2018 rail-workers in France staged sustained strikes, as a result of which foot traffic at train stations was severely reduced. Consequently, our revenue from sales generated at SNCF’s stations was also severely reduced. We therefore paid SNCF a reduced vending fee for the months of April through June, proportional to the days during which there were no strike. SNCF’s claim is for the full value of the vending fees. The court rejected this claim on September 26, 2018. However, on appeal the court of appeal (Cour administrative d’appel de Paris) ruled in favor of SNCF for the entire claim amount of €8.1 million. Despite these proceedings, our relationship with SNCF remains positive with the contract continuing in effect through 2025. On July 17, 2014, the Italian Competition Authority (“ICA”) initiated proceedings against the Argenta Group pursuant to article 14 of Law n. 287/90 to assess an allegation against Argenta Group and eight other companies operating in the self-service retail section in connection with potential unlawful market sharing. On February 25, 2015, the ICA initiated proceedings against three additional companies and CONFIDA Associazione Italiana Distribuzione Automatica, the association representing the main companies of the Italian retail industry, and extended the investigation into further allegations of anti-competitive behavior in relation to certain private and public tenders for self-service retail services. On June 14, 2016, the ICA issued its final decision holding that the Argenta Group and all other parties to the proceeding (except for Gedac S.r.l.) had infringed art. 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The ICA imposed on all parties fines at the maximum possible level, consisting of 10% of the overall annual turnover of a company. The fine imposed on Argenta Group is equal to €19.7 million. On June 27, 2016, the ICA granted Argenta Group’s request to pay the fine in 30 monthly installments of €0.7 million each beginning in August 2016 and ending in January 2019; these payments were not indemnified under the Argenta Acquisition Agreement. On November 28, 2017, Argenta Group filed an appeal before the Italian Council of State to obtain a reduction of the amount of the fine. All installments of the penalty have been paid, however, the appeal for the reduction of the total amount remains ongoing. Individuals or companies affected by the illegal conduct could rely on the ICA decision to bring civil damages actions against Argenta Group and the other addressees of the decision. Damages actions are subject to a limitation period of five years from cessation of the damaging conduct. In this case, the damaging conduct could be deemed to have stopped, when the ICA opened the relevant investigation in July 2014, and no damage action has been brought to date. The Dutch tax authorities have challenged the deductibility of interest expenses on certain shareholder loans of Pelican Rouge B.V. for the financial years 2011 through 2014, and concluded that interest on these shareholder loans is not deductible. This conclusion has resulted in additional tax assessments of approximately 128 ----- €22 million. We appealed this decision in 2016. The Dutch tax authorities rejected our objection and we filed an appeal with the Court of The Hague in January 2017. We are awaiting a judgement from the court. The total tax losses carried forward attributable to the relevant period amount to €293.6 million, which could be partly disallowed depending on the outcome of the case. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not made any payment to the tax authorities. In connection with this claim, the purchase price for the acquisition of Pelican Rouge was reduced. In addition, we issued contingent value notes in favor of the previous owners of Pelican Rouge B.V. which are payable in the event that the final tax assessment due and payable is less than the amount of the purchase price reduction, in which case an amount representing the difference between the purchase price reduction and the final tax assessment is payable to the previous owners of Pelican Rouge B.V. The amount due under these contingent value notes (if any) will become payable following the settlement of the tax claim, which is currently included as an accrual on our balance sheet. The Swedish Tax Agency (“STA”) has denied interest expense deductions of Selecta Nordic Holding AB for the financial year 2016. We have appealed this decision and are awaiting a judgement from the administrative court. The interest expense deductions denied for this period amount to approximately €1.9 million, and the STA has disallowed approximately €7 million of tax losses carried forward.

226_2,Offerings 2019.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.3,Interest,21.3.2,Interest on the New Floating Rate Notes,"Interest on the New Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal outstanding on the New Floating Rate Notes (the “Euro Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus 5.375%, as determined by an agent appointed by the Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the Indenture (the “Calculation Agent”), which shall initially be Elavon Financial Services DAC, UK Branch. Interest on the New Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 2 of each year, commencing on January 2, 2020. If a particular interest payment date is not a Business Day, then the payment date will move to the next Business Day. Therefore the Interest Period will be one or more days longer. The Issuer will pay interest to the holders of record of such New Floating Rate Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date. Interest on the New Floating Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. 162 ----- The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., London time, on each Determination Date, determine the Euro Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the New Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”). The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Euro Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the New Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365; provided that interest shall only be paid in respect of New Floating Rate Notes outstanding on the applicable interest payment dates. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Euro Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent. The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the holder of any New Floating Rate Notes, provide the interest rate then in effect with respect to the New Floating Rate Notes. The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the New Floating Rate Notes to receive the payments of interest on the New Floating Rate Notes will be subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The Euro Applicable Rate on the New Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes: “Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period. “EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the eurozone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the eurozone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. “eurozone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro. “Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on but excluding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude April 1, 2020, with respect to the New Euro Fixed Rate Notes, and January 2, 2020, with respect to the New Floating Rate Notes. “Representative Amount” means an amount of at least €1.0 million. “Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, Bloomberg page “EBF” or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). 163 ----- “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

The Guarantors will grant the Guarantees and have also granted a senior guarantee of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, as described below under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that in the future guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement any other Credit Facility that is Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or Public Debt in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall, subject in each case to the Agreed Security Principles, also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the _Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ The Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released upon: - a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of ownership interests in the relevant Guarantor (directly or through a Holding Company of such Guarantor) such that the Guarantor does not remain a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Indenture; 166 ----- - the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; - defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction _and Discharge”;_ - as described in the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants— _Additional Guarantees”;_ - in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below); - as described under “Amendments and Waivers”; - with respect to any Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a result of a transaction permitted by “Certain Covenants—Merger and _Consolidation—Subsidiary Guarantors” and the Indenture;_ - with respect to any Guarantor, in connection with a solvent liquidation of such Guarantor pursuant to which substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor remain owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor; or - upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Notes. Substantially all the operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, to the extent of the assets of such Subsidiaries. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, and after giving effect to the transactions described under “Use of Proceeds” (the “Refinancing”), the Guarantors accounted for approximately 97.7% of the consolidated total assets, approximately 89.8% of the consolidated revenue (before the impact of vending fee harmonization) and approximately 88.8% of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2019, after giving effect to the Refinancing, the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have had no material third-party debt outstanding (excluding financial leases and factoring arrangements). Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

The Issuer granted a first-priority security interest in respect of the receivables under the Proceeds Loan to secure the Notes. See “Security.” It is anticipated that funds received by the Issuer as payments of interest under the Proceeds Loans will be used to service a portion of the interest payments under the Notes. As the aggregate principal amount of the Proceeds Loan is lower than that of the Notes, the Proceeds Loans may have a variable interest rate that allows for higher interest payments from time to time and the principal on the Proceeds Loan may be repaid in order to service interest payments on the Notes.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes, any Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral shall be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among others: - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; provided that to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specific period but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not reasonably be expected to adversely impact relationships with third parties;

However, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral only after the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture on a super senior priority basis, if any, have been repaid in full. Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “Certain _Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” MidCo, the Issuer_ and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including Additional Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The proceeds of any enforcement over Collateral will be applied to discharge all liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations and any other super priority status indebtedness and, once such obligations have been fully discharged, will be applied pro rata in repayment of liabilities under the Notes, the Indenture and other pari _passu indebtedness of the Issuer or the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral_ pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law _Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the New Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a parallel debt which will form part of the secured obligation. The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions. The enforcement of the Security Documents is subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law limitations in the event of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s bankruptcy. In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these limitations, the enforceable amounts of a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to the Notes—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, MidCo, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Collateral provider will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the Security Documents), to freely operate the Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom. No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Notes, the payment of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any Hedging Obligations. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all. 170 ----- In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents place limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause the sale of some of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” The Trustee for the Notes has, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have: - irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents); - irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and - accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) and each Holder will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. Under certain circumstances, the creditors under such Indebtedness will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Trustee and the holders of the Notes under the Indenture or may have a competing claim not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement.

In the case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the 2018 Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of the 2018 Offering Memorandum. In the case of redemption due to withholding or deduction as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the 2018 Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of a Successor Company (as defined below) or the predecessor of a successor of a Guarantor.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 15 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably available to the Payor and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request. If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee 178 ----- and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in either the Indenture, the Guarantees or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

226_2,Offerings 2019.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.21,Change of Control,21.21.1,,"The Indenture provides that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “Optional _Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes (equal to €100,000 in principal amount or_ in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof in the case of Notes denominated in euros and CHF 150,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the CHF Notes; provided that Notes denominated in euros of €100,000 or less in principal amount and CHF Notes of CHF 150,000 or less in principal amount may only be purchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by compliance therewith. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date 179 ----- that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice of the Change of Control Offer to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change _of Control Payment”);_ (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control; (4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event may require prepayment and cancellation or other consequences in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the 180 ----- consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and the decision whether to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above will in such circumstance be made in the good faith judgment of the Issuer. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, and giving effect to the manner of measurement described in clause (4) of this paragraph;

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under this covenant, it shall constitute a default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or, at the option of the Issuer, first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the aggregate principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced after giving effect to the manner of measurement described in clause (4) of the third paragraph of this covenant; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Original Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Original Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if denominated in euro, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

However, a default under clauses (3), (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4) or (6), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. 205 ----- If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture provides that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain _Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the_ Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, fees or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security and/or indemnity and/or cost and fee cover; and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that, 206 ----- in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security and/or cost and fee cover satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities, fees and expenses caused or incurred by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured and/or compensated to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity, security and/or cost or fee cover to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

Accordingly, a holder is urged to consult his or her own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the Offering to him or her, including the applicability and effect of Dutch tax laws. Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts under Dutch tax law.

A change to such organizational structure or to the manner in which the Issuer conducts its business may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect any such change. This summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at the date of this Offering Memorandum.

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the_ possibility of paying such additional amounts or making additional payments in redemption of the Additional Notes does not result in the Additional Notes being treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” under the applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Additional Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid, or additional payments in redemption of the Additional Notes will have to be made, is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination that the Additional Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. Holder acquires the Additional Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Additional Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Additional Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Additional Notes would generally be recharacterized as ordinary income.

However, because the Additional Notes are subject to optional redemption by us, special rules apply which could result in a deferral of the amortization of some or all amortizable bond premium until later during the term of the Additional Notes.

In addition to interest on the Additional Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld), you will be required to include in income any additional amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received, determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the foreign currency so received. If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on: the last day of the accrual period; the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period.

If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate on the date of disposition. In the case of an Additional Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Additional Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Additional Note by such U.S. Holder, reduced by any amortized bond premium. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency to purchase an Additional Note, the amount paid for the Additional Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase. In the case of an Additional Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it makes the special election described in the preceding paragraph, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and, except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency gain or loss, generally will be long term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder has held the Additional Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Additional Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Additional Note generally will be treated as U.S. source income or as an offset to U.S. source income, respectively, and will generally be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of an Additional Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign currency purchase price of the Additional Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Additional Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Additional Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder disposes of the Additional Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Additional Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Additional Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a U.S. Holder may realize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a U.S. Holder will realize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to principal amount and accrued and unpaid stated interest) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Under proposed Treasury regulations, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are published generally would be “grandfathered” unless such obligations are materially modified after such date.

The proposal is expected to include in respect of interest payments the replacement of the existing debtor-based regime by a paying agent-based regime for Swiss withholding tax. This paying agentbased regime is expected to be similar to the one contained in the draft legislation published by the Swiss Federal Council on December 17, 2014, which was subsequently withdrawn on June 24, 2015.

The initiative requests the implementation of a paying agent-based system that (i) subjects all interest payments made to individuals resident in Switzerland to Swiss withholding tax and (ii) provides an exemption from Swiss withholding tax for interest payments to all other persons (including Swiss corporations). If any such a new paying agent-based regime were to be enacted and were to result in the deduction or withholding of Swiss withholding tax on any interest payments in respect of a Note by any person other than the Issuer, failing which the Guarantor, the noteholder would not be entitled to receive any additional amounts as a result of such deduction or withholding under the terms of the Notes.

The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors (as defined below) are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat in the Netherlands. None of the directors of the Issuer reside in the United States and a substantial amount of the Issuer’s assets, and a substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch Guarantors’ directors are located outside of the United States. The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation on the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process, (b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of the court has been based on an internationally acceptable ground and (d) the judgment by the court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on the same cause, provided that the earlier judgment qualifies for recognition in the Netherlands. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable.

However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, and notably if: - the rights of defense have been violated; - such recognition or enforcement would be incompatible with Belgian public policy; - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets without any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state; - the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement could then be granted) or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable laws; - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian private international law; - the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter; - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium; - Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by 267 ----- which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court that pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or other non U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior inconsistent judgment given in a Hague Convention Member State of the European Union or a member state of the EEA which the English court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention Choice of Court Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the Lugano Conventions of 1988 and 2007; - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the United States; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S. judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In particular, a judgment given by a U.S. federal or state court may not be enforced by the courts of England and Wales if such judgment: - is subject to a pending or proposal appeal; - cannot be enforced in the state in which the judgment was given; or - was made in proceedings, the bringing of which was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of that country, unless such proceedings were brought by or with the agreement of the person against where the judgment was given or that person submitted to the jurisdiction of such courts. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Furthermore, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor.

226_2,Offerings 2019.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.4,France,23.4.1,,"The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Additional Notes against French entities and/or French individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, or enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the competent French civil court is satisfied that the following cumulative conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such U.S. court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final, binding and enforceable foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect such as autorité de la chose jugée and force exécutoire) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, and that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect (autorité de la chose jugée) as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French Law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French Law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations mentioned above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (Law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as most recently modified by French Ordinance No. 2011-2012 of August 24, 2011 and French law No. 2014-344 of March 17, 2014) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. 269 ----- Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code (Code civil), a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant. For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to recent case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent that an action has been initiated before a foreign court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive his or her rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, with respect to legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code do not prevail European provisions in disputes opposing French nationals to a person domiciled in a Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the European Union. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in 272 ----- accordance with the proceeding set forth by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz _über das internationale Privatrecht) and the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische Zivilprozessordnung) and, in certain circumstances, the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Bankruptcy_ (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in articles 25 et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale _Privatrecht), which include, among others:_ - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective; - the judgment of such U.S. court is final and non-appealable under U.S. federal or state law; - service of process to the defendant was completed in accordance with the relevant legal requirements at the defendant’s domicile or permanent residence (including requirements resulting from applicable international treaties), or the defendant unconditionally participated in the foreign proceedings: - the original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss civil proceedings law, in particular the right to be heard; - the matter (Verfahren) between the same parties and on the same subject resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court has either been (i) commenced or decided by a Swiss court, provided that such Swiss matter was pending before a Swiss court prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings or decided by a Swiss court before the decision of the U.S. court, or (ii) decided by a court in a third country, provided such third country matter was decided prior to the decision of the U.S. court and such third country matter is recognizable in Switzerland; and - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Additional Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in the sense of art. 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht). Generally, if substantive proceedings relating to the Notes were commenced in Switzerland, it is likely that a Swiss court would apply New York state law (as the Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York). However, the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht) allows for the application of Swiss law instead of the apparent applicable foreign law in the event that the application of such foreign law would lead to a result which is incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Furthermore, irrespective of the law chosen by the parties and irrespective of any other law deemed applicable based on the rules of the aforementioned act, a different law, i.e., Swiss law or, to a lesser extent, a different foreign law, may be applicable due to its purpose in special cases. Thus, it cannot be excluded that a Swiss court would, either in part or in full, apply a different law, other than the governing law of the Notes, if substantive proceedings were commenced in Switzerland. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages ordered by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the depositions of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial discovery process exists. Rather, Swiss civil procedure provides for the possibility for judicial pre-trial proceedings concerning the precautionary production of evidence (vorsorgliche Beweisführung) only in certain circumstances and under certain conditions. In addition, during the main proceedings, a Swiss court would decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and the related burden of proof. 273 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the centre of main interests of a debtor, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption should be rebutted where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A debtor’s centre of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of 274 ----- main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

Accordingly, where debtors have their centre of main interests or an “establishment” in the Netherlands they may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain exceptions provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation. See “—European Union.” The Dutch insolvency laws may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws. Any insolvency proceedings applicable to the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors may be governed by Dutch insolvency laws. There are two insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, a suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order 275 ----- that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset. Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar _Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal_ treatment). Therefore, in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (i) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (ii) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (iii) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset (verrekend) against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor. Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy laws could reduce your potential recovery in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Both a suspension of payments and bankruptcy have retroactive effect from 00.00 hours of the day on which the suspension of payments or the bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch company is declared. Unlike chapter 11 proceedings under United States bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, a suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against Dutch debtors would allow secured creditors and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution as described above may be ordered by the competent court both in a suspension of payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights, as described above, may be imposed. Furthermore, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for the set off. 276 ----- Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by the operation of law when a suspension of payments is granted and terminate by the operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted; and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Additional Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Additional Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for verification, and the receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors who wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in a suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Additional Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Additional Notes or less than they could recover in a United States liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Additional Notes to be delayed. Interest on claims accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the Additional Notes. To the extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. The Dutch legislator has prepared a bill for the implementation of a composition outside bankruptcy or moratorium of payments proceedings and is referred to as the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (WHOA). On July 8, 2019, the bill was submitted to the parliament and will now go through the legislative process (which requires debate and adoption in the Second Chamber of Dutch Parliament and then the First Chamber). It is still uncertain what the final legislation will be (due to possible amendments) and what the timeline is for implementation. It is expected that this legislation will come into effect in the foreseeable future. Under the WHOA as currently drafted, a proceeding somewhat similar to the chapter 11 proceedings under United States bankruptcy law and the scheme of arrangement under English bankruptcy laws, will become available for companies in financial distress, where the debtor stays in possession and can offer a composition plan to its creditors (including secured creditors and shareholders). The new legislation also allows that group companies providing guarantees for the debtors obligations are included in the plan. If and once this legislation comes into force, a debtor may offer its creditors a composition plan which may also entail a revision or release of the guarantees in place granted by group companies. As a result hereof, it may well be that claims against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors can be compromised as a result of a composition if the relevant majority of creditors within a class vote in favour of such a composition.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs. Furthermore, if a Dutch Guarantor enters into a transaction (such as the granting of a guarantee or security interest), the validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be contested by the Dutch company or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in a suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy, if (i) that transaction is not in the company’s corporate interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and (ii) the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or the giving of security is in the interest of the relevant Dutch company, a Dutch court would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but also all relevant circumstances, including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and any indirect benefit derived by the relevant Dutch company as a consequence of the interdependence of it with the group of companies to which it belongs and whether or not the subsistence of the relevant Dutch company is jeopardized by conducting such transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in the corporate interests. As of October 1, 2012, the prohibition on financial assistance for a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) was removed from Dutch law. In connection with such removal the legislator noted that the granting of security with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra vires act. At present, there is no Dutch case law on this subject.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Under Dutch law, any creditor of a Dutch Guarantor or its receiver (curator) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Additional Notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Additional Notes was conducted without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its or their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions) and (iii) at the time of the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Additional Notes was conducted (including the granting of the Guarantees or any security), the relevant Dutch Guarantor and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio _pauliana)._ A receiver (curator) may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the above mentioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is, however, presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty in order to give preference to the 278 ----- counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral will not prevent effect being given to the overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the situation has a close connection (and for this purpose “overriding provisions” are provisions the respect for which are regarded as crucial by a jurisdiction for safeguarding its public interests to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to an agreement and include any rules (whether mandatory or not) that must be applied pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation) and will not prevent regard having to be had to the law of the jurisdiction in which performance takes place in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance. In addition, enforcement of each Dutch law security interest in the Collateral (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Among other things, under Dutch law shares may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of association of the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement. Rights of third parties acquiring a share or a limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder trouw) may also affect the binding effect and enforceability of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral. In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law. The Security Agent or the relevant security interest provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the secured assets, except when otherwise agreed. In the case of secured assets, the Security Agent and the security interest provider may agree to an alternative foreclosure procedure once the security right has become enforceable. The security interest providers have agreed to waive the right to request such alternative foreclosure procedure. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the secured assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. In the case of a pledge, the right of the relevant security interest provider to request approval of a private sale may be excluded. It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The beneficial holders of the Additional Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the documentation relating to the Additional Notes will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Additional Notes. The pledges governed by Dutch law will directly secure the parallel debt.

This also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose centre of main interests is not situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction. Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite). Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX “Insolvency of enterprises” of the Belgian Code of Economic Law (the “Belgian Insolvency Act”). 279 ----- Note that in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation _déficitaire). The latter proceedings will not be further discussed._",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed. As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelve months as from the start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months. The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued. If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantors, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur _d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of_ any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator 280 ----- (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice). Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the debtors or one of its corporate bodies, the court may replace them with a temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/ _administrateur provisoire) for the duration of the moratorium._ The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations. The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties. In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. The court order confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it. In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, although only limited measures can be imposed by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without their individual consent. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy. To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. 281 ----- The court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The court-ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de _justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be limited to the transfer_ price, subject to some limited exceptions.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de _paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they_ fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one or several ongoing contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will not impair any rights in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an ongoing contract may demand the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, in which case its claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors. The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contract. As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse). For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest 282 ----- of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period. If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the Insolvency Regulation (Recast), not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles: - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called “estate debts,” have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization). - Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests. - Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated). - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and collateral. It is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned conditions are met. Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. 283 ----- If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods” (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit requirement is not met and the creditor knew or should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, section 11.03 (Limitation of Liability of Belgian Guarantors) of the Indenture contains such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor(s) will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit. The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate purpose and statutory purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association, and the guarantee or collateral may not include any liability that would result in unlawful financial assistance in accordance with article 329 and 629 of the Belgian Companies Code dated 7 May 1999, as amended or replaced from time to time, or Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations dated 23 March 2019, as amended from time to time, whichever is applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Pursuant to Belgian law, security is an “accessory” which must be granted to the same person to whom the secured debt is owed, except in the case of financial collateral within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or collateral subject to the Belgian Act of July 11, 2013 on in rem security interests over movable assets. In order to enable the Security Agent to hold security created under certain applicable law (including Belgian law), the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of the parallel debt mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors to the holders of the Additional Notes under or in connection with the Indenture. The parallel debt structure is commonly used for the purposes of taking Belgian law security in the context of transactions of this nature. In the event of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the parallel debt structure means that the secured parties may be exposed to credit risk on the Security Agent, if payments in respect of the parallel debt and any proceeds received by the Security Agent cannot be separated from its other assets. A parallel debt structure is not an uncommon market practice in Belgium and the validity thereof under Belgian law is supported by legal authors. Although various valid arguments exist under Belgian law to the effect that the security created in favor of the Security Agent, in its capacity as creditor of the parallel debt, would be valid, the possibility of a Belgian court finding otherwise cannot be excluded, given that there is no case law on this subject. Lastly, Belgian pledges over financial collateral (such as the shares of the Belgian Guarantor) have been or will be granted to the Security Agent acting for itself and for the account of the secured parties pursuant to Article 5 of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. This provision allows for the creation of security over financial collateral held by an agent acting as representative for secured parties, provided that the secured parties can be determined on the basis of the security agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte). The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) security interests provided for pre-existing debts (save for any security granted during the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings). Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment. In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or at an undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian Guarantor’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure pre-existing debts. If the Guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the above), holders of the Additional Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests. Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana).

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. During the administration of a company, a statutory moratorium is imposed and a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than security financial collateral arrangements) or guarantee granted by it without the consent of the administrator or the court. The moratorium does not, however, apply to a “financial collateral agreement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. In addition, in limited circumstances (as set forth in more detail below) a secured creditor can appoint an administrative receiver, at which time no automatic statutory moratorium is created and creditors may begin or continue any legal action against the company, including petitioning for liquidation. A chargee can appoint its choice of administrator by the out of court route or an administrative receiver if it holds a qualifying floating charge and such floating charge security, together with fixed charge security charges the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant English chargor’s property. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (i) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (ii) purports to empower the chargeholder to appoint an administrator of the company or (iii) purports to empower the chargeholder to appoint an administrative receiver. Even if the chargee holds a qualifying floating charge it can only appoint an administrative receiver if one of the exceptions to the general prohibition of appointing an administrative receiver applies. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment is that the chargee can appoint an administrative receiver under security forming part of a “capital markets arrangement” (as defined in the Insolvency Act, as amended), which is the case if the issuer of the notes incurs (or expected to incur) a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, as amended, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). Once an administrative receiver is appointed by the chargee the company or its directors will not be permitted to appoint an administrator by the out of court route and a court will only appoint an administrator if the charge under which the administrative receiver is appointed is successfully challenged or the chargee agrees.

At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved. In the case of a liquidation commenced by way of a court order, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the company except by leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose (although security enforcement is not affected). Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsalable or not readily salable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. This power does not apply to a contract all the obligations under which have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and to execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent transactions. 287 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 1986, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the “prescribed part” (see “—Prescribed Part”), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - first ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets of the debtor; - second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting forth the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - third ranking claims: preferential creditors. Preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date. As between one another, preferential debts rank pari passu; - fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the prescribed part must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”); - fifth ranking claims: unsecured creditors. However, any secured creditor not repaid in full from the realization of assets subject to its security can also claim the remaining debt due to it (a shortfall) from the insolvent estate as an unsecured claim. To pay a shortfall, the officeholder can only use realization from unsecured assets, because secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the prescribed part in respect of a shortfall unless the prescribed part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - sixth ranking claims: subordinated creditors. Creditors whose claims are subordinated to the payment of all of the insolvent company’s other creditors; and - seventh ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in Section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended).

Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith for value).

The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the decision to prefer must be made within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in Section 240 of the Insolvency Act, as amended) if the beneficiary of the security interest or the guarantee is not a connected person, or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to give it by a desire to produce the “better position” for that person. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position.

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the Guarantors would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a company incorporated under English law has its “centre of main interests” in a Member State other than England and Wales, then the main insolvency proceedings for that company may be opened in the Member State in which its centre of main interests is located and be subject to the laws of that Member State. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The European Commission has published amendments to the EU Insolvency Regulation which may alter the manner in which the test for determining where a company has its centre of main interests might be applied during the term of the Additional Notes. At this stage it is not possible to conclusively determine what (if any) impact there might be in relation to the Additional Notes. Similarly, the United Kingdom Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign (i.e., 285 ----- non-English) court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its centre of main interests in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). To the extent that the United Kingdom Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 conflict with an obligation of the United Kingdom under the EU Insolvency Regulation, the requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail. English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar and it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “Insolvency Act”), a company is insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), or, among other matters, if it fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 or to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or similar court order). The obligations under the Additional Notes are secured by English law governed security interests over the Collateral and therefore English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the security interests over the Collateral that are governed by English law. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights and/or the Collateral securing the Additional Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English company.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

More specifically, such transaction must be allowed by the respective obligor’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent these do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the Guarantee and the subsequent Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Furthermore, corporate benefit must be established for each obligor that is incorporated in England and Wales by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he or she considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote success of the relevant obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction for which there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to have abused their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including where not governed by English law) granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (together with prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the 21 day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and a creditor of the applicable chargor. Furthermore, failure to register also means that the debt that was intended to be secured is deemed to have become immediately payable. In the event the relevant security document is not registered, a chargor incorporated in England and Wales may be required to enter into a new security document and register that with Companies House within 21 days of its creation. Alternatively, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify the position and allow the charge to be registered after the 21 day period has expired. This application can be made by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard as to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security.

In practice,_ mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law. They are carried out under the aegis of a court appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the 293 ----- mandataire ad hoc are determined by the competent court (usually the commercial court) that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement or forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have agreed to take part in the proceedings usually decide not to do so. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by him or her. The order of the president of the court appointing a mandataire ad hoc is notified for information purposes to the debtor’s auditors. Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see “—Insolvency Test” above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law. They are carried out under the aegis of a court appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur being able to request an extension without exceeding a total duration of five months of proceedings). The duties of the _conciliateur are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or trade_ partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement or forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have agreed to take part in the proceedings usually decide not to do so. The debtor that received a formal notice to pay or against which a creditor initiated legal proceedings, retains the right to petition the judge who commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—Grace Periods”), such decision being taken after hearing the _conciliateur._ With respect to grace periods under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement, impose grace periods on creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) for their claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement) and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, or invited to attend the hearing before the 295 ----- court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is (except for small companies, for which the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) appointed to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court makes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 18 months. The role of the court appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circulate to its creditors. Creditors do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court appointed administrator. Nevertheless, up to five creditors may request the court to be appointed controllers. The court appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. In addition, the court may convert such proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings (i) after commencement of the proceedings, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, if it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) before commencement of the proceedings or (ii) at any time during the observation period upon its own initiative or upon request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor in a case where the debtor becomes insolvent or (iii) upon request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, bondholders’ assembly (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end. At any time during the observation period, the court may also convert such proceedings into liquidation proceedings if the debtor becomes insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. As soon as insolvency proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example, the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the debtor’s business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt for equity swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. In any case, a creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) is appointed by the court in order to register creditors’ claims and protect their collective interest in the judicial proceedings. _Standard consultation: This applies to: (i) debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor_ (commissaire aux comptes) or prepared by a chartered accountant (expert comptable), or, if they are, (ii) debtors that have 150 employees or less or a turnover of €20 million or less. In such cases, the court appointed administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court appointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment times proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum possible length of the plan (ten years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors which do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt for equity swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of 296 ----- the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt for equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he or she been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. _Committee based consultation: This applies to larger companies, whose accounts are certified by a statutory_ auditor or established by a chartered accountant and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million, or upon the debtor’s or the court appointed administrator’s request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do not exceed the aforementioned thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two creditors’ committees which are established by the court appointed administrator on the basis of the claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings: - one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (the “credit institutions committee”); and - the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such committee by the court appointed administrator (the “major suppliers’ committee”). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of obligations (such as bonds or notes and including capital market debt instruments such as the Additional Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of such debt securities will be established (the “bondholders’ general meeting”), in which all such holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing law(s) of those obligations. Each committee votes at a two-third majority of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote. As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committee. The proposed plan: - must “take into account” subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the commencement of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may, among other things, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien), and/or debt for equity swaps (debt for equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the creditors may subscribe to such share capital increase by way of set off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the provisions of the plan, where applicable). Creditors that are members of the credit institutions’ committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare an alternative safeguard plan that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders’ meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders’ general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court appointed administrator. Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan. The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee (two thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors casting a vote). 297 ----- Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders’ general meeting must, if applicable, inform the court appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its vote or (ii) the full or partial payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement. The court appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors’ committees/bondholders’ general meeting. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the request of the creditor or of the court appointed administrator. The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan or take part in the vote. Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders’ general meeting at the same two third’s majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting are consulted by the creditors’ representative in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above. If the debtor’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders’ general meeting within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the court empowers the court appointed administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in order to take corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s by laws (including modifications of its share capital) required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights. If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the general bondholder meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceeding into judicial reorganization proceeding if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the safeguard proceeding would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent. _Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: Public creditors (financial administrations, social_ security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). Tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As for indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast track” difficulties faced by large companies, i.e., those which publish: - consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code; or 298 ----- - which publish accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public accountant and have (i) more than 20 employees, (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million (excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the total duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is only one month (unless the court decides to extend it by an additional month). However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and provisions relating to the recovery of assets by owners benefiting from title retention clauses do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. In particular, the creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt for equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the committees or that are not bondholders. While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings apply only to “financial creditors” (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit institutions’ committee and bondholders’ general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended until the adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) relating to debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after their commencement if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or the debtor’s business activities during the observation period (post commencement non privileged debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of business according to their contractual or legal terms. To be eligible for accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions: - the debtor must not be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings or the accelerated financial safeguards proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome; - the debtor must exceed the thresholds provided for to constitute creditors’ committee (see above) or the court shall have authorized such constitution in the opening decision; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and the bondholders’ general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months, following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and not approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings.

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent; de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil liability if it fails to do so. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the state prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the state prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor with the debtor’s help, or the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, committees of creditors and a bondholders’ general meeting may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard proceedings (see above). In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the state prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders’ meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders’ equity to a level equal to at least one half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court may appoint a court officer (mandataire de justice) whose mission will be to convene a shareholders’ meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders who refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies), providing new equity and undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court appointed administrator, can order the total or partial transfer of the business. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French labor code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and (iii) the modification of the company’s share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and allows the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then following (x) the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and at the request of the court appointed administrator or of the state prosecutor and (y) at least three months having elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders’ meetings required to approve the modification of 300 ----- the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: - appoint a court officer (mandataire de justice) in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or - order the sale in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders who refused the share capital increase and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the company’s shareholder meetings; the shareholders who accepted the share capital modification have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. Any consent clause is deemed unwritten. In the event of a forced sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, who is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings and no maximum time period is provided by law to limit the duration of the judicial liquidation process. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly to liquidate assets and settle liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority ranking order for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: (i) an asset sale plan (in which case a court appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor and organize such sale of the business as a going concern); or (ii) a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (a) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only)); (b) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to enter into the sale agreement with the offeror); or (c) in practice, request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement this process is questioned by certain legal authors and case law in this respect has varied. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif) or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to an insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or - if there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a court officer (mandataire de justice) in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), which runs from the insolvency date of the debtor until the date of the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void while others are voidable by the court. - Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the obligations of the other party, payments of debts due but not payable at the time of payment, payments of matured debts in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business and security granted for previously incurred obligations, provisional attachment or seizure measures (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made by way of security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité). - Transactions which are voidable by the court (if the third-party knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time) include payments made on debts that are payable, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of_ continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12 22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its contractual obligations post filing (and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de _cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such a case, the acceleration of the_ obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the plan for the sale of the business or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (i) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (ii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set off of related (connexes) debts and 302 ----- payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business); (iii) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor; (iv) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered or goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed within one year of the expiration of the observation period; (v) creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (a) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (b) to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or (c) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except where such asset whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another Member State in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 5 EU of the Insolvency Regulation or Article 8 of the New EU Insolvency Regulation (as defined); and (vi) in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en _cours) will be required._ In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the financial creditors who fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose debts arose prior to the commencement of proceedings must file a claim with the court appointed creditors’ representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post commencement non privileged debts, with respect to which the two—or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the judicial administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proofs of claim. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, 303 ----- the court will appoint a liquidator (usually the former creditors’ representative) in charge of selling the assets of the debtor and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where the sale of the business is considered, the court will usually appoint an administrator to manage the debtor during the temporary continuation of the business operations (see above) and to organize the sale of the business process. If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business, it can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials, fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien (see above), post commencement creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post commencement creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from extending credit or guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purposes and corporate interests of the guarantor company. Pursuant to French corporate benefit rules, a French Guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by a French Guarantor and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Additional Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above.

Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor will be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under new Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code. The ordinance No. 2017-748 dated May 4, 2017, relating to security agent (ordonnance n° 2017-748 du 4 _mai 2017 relative à l’agent des sûretés) clarifies and modernizes the status of the French security agent by_ repealing the former Article 2328-1 of the French Civil Code and by creating a new regime for the agent specifically designated for the purpose of taking, managing and enforcing security interest and personal guarantees in the context of financing arrangements. This new regime applies to security agents appointed after October 1, 2017. New Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor’s interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or several creditors in a 305 ----- debtor’s insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers. The beneficial holders of interests in the Additional Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Additional Notes to benefit from a secured claim, they will be provided for by the creation of “Parallel Debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) to the holders of the Additional Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Additional Notes. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Additional Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10 25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case by case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following defaults or events of default, and acts as trustee in the interests of the holders of the Additional Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011_ n°10 25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of the Security Agent. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee or the Security Agent.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Additional Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of an Additional Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance, then the issuance of the Additional Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Additional Notes Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Additional Notes may not enjoy the benefit of the Additional Notes, the Additional Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Additional Notes received with respect to the Additional Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Additional Notes Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the creditor having initiated the action paulienne.

Under Italian law the beneficiary of a security interest must be clearly identified and indicated in the relevant security document. Due to the impossibility to clearly identify and keep track over time of the names of the individual holder of the Additional Notes, Italian security documents are created, and the Collateral governed by Italian law will therefore be granted and perfected, in favor of the Trustee and in favor of the Security Agent, acting in its capacity as legal representative (mandatario con rappresentanza) of all secured creditors (including the holders of the Additional Notes) under the Intercreditor Agreement. It is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether under Italian law a security can be created and perfected (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of the Trustee since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of the Trustee as agent or trustee for holders of the Additional Notes under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. In bond issuances made by Italian joint stock companies (società per azioni), pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), security interests can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Additional Notes who will then be authorized to enforce them on behalf of the holders of the Additional Notes. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a _rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf_ the holders of the Additional Notes which are neither directly parties to the security documents nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, there is no guidance or available interpretation on how such a new provision may be applied to security created to secure bond issuances made by a non-Italian entity. Given the above and considering that the holders of the Additional Notes are not party to the Italian law governed security documents, there is a risk that an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Additional Notes (in relation to which the relevant perfection formalities acknowledging their status as a secured creditor are not perfected at the time of enforcement) are not secured by the security interests created under the Italian law governed security documents and/or cannot enforce that security interest. The validity of parallel debt structures under Italian law has, to date, not been considered before the Italian courts and the security interests comprising the parallel debt claim could be held to be in conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the enforceability of a security interest governed by Italian law securing a parallel debt obligation will be upheld by an Italian court and further, no assurance can be provided on how an Italian court would interpret an Italian law security instrument purporting to secure, inter alia, a “parallel debt” obligation. The procedures for the enforcement of Italian law security and the timing for obtaining judicial decisions (including in relation to security enforcement) in the Republic of Italy are materially complex and time consuming, especially given that the Italian courts maintain, in general, a significant role in the enforcement process, in comparison to other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. If a security interest is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization, refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness, avoidance or clawback of Italian Bankruptcy Law (as defined below) and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or clawback of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect 308 ----- period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Additional Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds and in good faith; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the fact that the relevant provisions of laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles or mandatory provisions of Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del _diritto);_ - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied, see “—Financial Assistance”; - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis, see “—Corporate Benefit and _Corporate Authorization”;_ 309 ----- - under Italian law each guarantee needs to expressly provide for a maximum amount payable by the relevant guarantor thereunder, as mentioned in Paragraph “—Guarantee and Security Limitations” below; - in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including, with some exceptions, the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document, another way is to have each page of the document stamped by the post office through a particular modality (piego raccomandato aperto); - the priority rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure, attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure or attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto)) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding/bankruptcy proceedings; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant security provider other than the pledgee from starting or continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge, although the relevant pledgee remains entitled to priority over the proceeds of such liquidation if it intervenes in the enforcement procedure pursuant to the applicable civil procedure rules; - in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas or shares; - pursuant to Article 2744 of the Italian Civil Code any agreement which provides that on failing to pay a secured debt the ownership of the pledged asset will be transferred to the creditor is considered void; - changes or amendments to contractual documentation may constitute a novation (novazione) of the relevant document. The question whether a contractual document may be novated or not is primarily a function of the nature and the extent of the changes, notwithstanding any contractual provision to the contrary and a matter of interpretation of the intention of the parties, reserved to the Courts; - in light, amongst other things, of the above paragraph, the extension of existing security or the granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of new notes or in connection with modifications to the secured obligations (including, for the sake of clarity, the extension of the existing pledge agreement over the shares of Argenta in order to secure the indebtedness under the Additional Notes also) or the completion of new perfection formalities may give rise to new hardening periods for such security interests. The applicable hardening period for such security interests would run from the moment each security interest has been granted, perfected, extended or recreated; - various claims, collectively referred to as privilegi, are given statutory priority under the Italian Civil Code against the claims of the other creditors in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property. These are classified as either privilegi generali (general privileges or liens), which apply only in respect of all personal property of the debtor, or privilegi speciali (special privileges or liens), which apply only in respect of particular (immovable or movable) property. Some of these claims have mandatory priority and would therefore be preferred to the secured creditors in case of an insolvency proceeding. Such claims include, for example, courts costs, mandatory social security contributions and credits of the Government for taxes; - the enforceability of subordination clauses in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding is untested before Italian courts and, accordingly, the receiver or the insolvency trustee may disregard the subordination 310 ----- provisions contained in the documentation and distribute the proceeds pursuant to the rules applicable to the relevant bankruptcy or insolvency procedure; and - any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, inter alia, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian law no. 108 of March 7, 1996 (i.e., the Italian usury law), as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations; and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree no. 385/1993 (i.e., the Italian Banking Act)) may not be enforceable. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: (i) that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and (ii) that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design. If a court decided either that a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, the beneficiary of the guarantee may cease to have any claim with respect to the relevant guarantor. The same would also apply to any security interest.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

If a security interest or a guarantee is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee or a security interest) must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and its existence is purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of upstream or cross-stream security or guarantee (i.e., security or guarantee granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive some benefits or advantages from granting such guarantee or security. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. In particular, in the case of upstream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples include financial consideration in the form of access by the relevant company to cash flow through intercompany loans from other members of the group (especially 311 ----- when derived from the same transaction secured or guaranteed by the relevant Italian company), while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for, lack of corporate benefit and, conflict of interest. The absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including the granting of a security interest or a guarantee granted by an Italian company) ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interests of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the security interest granted by an Italian company could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interests of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to upstream and downstream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. In addition, the guarantee granted by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy must be supported by corporate benefit; in other words, the maximum guaranteed amount must be indicated in the guarantee and will not exceed the financial capabilities of the relevant Guarantor. It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to such Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportional to the assets of the relevant Guarantor, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void; however, it is uncertain whether courts are entitled to debate and rule over such determinations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation. More specifically, Italian rules on financial assistance, provided under articles 2358 and 2474 of the Italian Civil Code, prohibit the grant by the Guarantor organized in Italy (the “Italian Guarantor”) of guarantee or security interests in respect of indebtedness incurred for the acquisition (or the refinancing of the acquisition) of such Guarantor’s own shares or quotas, or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls such Guarantor. In light of these rules, the liability of each Italian Guarantor under its guarantee or security interests of the Additional Notes is expressly limited to an amount corresponding to the principal amount of the financial indebtedness of the relevant Italian Guarantor to be repaid through the proceeds of the Additional Notes, in order to exclude from the relevant guaranteed/secured obligations any portion of the proceeds of the Additional Notes incurred or utilized for the purposes indicated above falling within the prohibition under the Italian financial assistance rules. This “virtual tranching” structure (i.e., whereby the relevant portion of the proceeds of the Additional Notes which do not constitute “acquisition debt” and, therefore, do not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules, are identified, but not actually separated into a separate tranche of financial indebtedness) is untested in Italian courts. Therefore, it may be deemed insufficient for clearly distinguishing and separating the non-“acquisition debt” portion of the proceeds of the Additional Notes distributed to Italian Guarantor, and it may result in the relevant Guarantee violating the provisions of articles 2358 and 2474 of the Italian Civil Code. If an Italian court determined that such a violation had occurred, it would result in the guarantees by the Italian Guarantor being null and void, which would mean that holders of the Additional Notes would have no recourse to the assets of the Italian Guarantors and no claim against the Italian Guarantor in an insolvency or other scenario.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In addition, the proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees shall be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without limitation, the holders of the Additional Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Additional Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Note Guarantees and security. Additionally, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued by an Italian Guarantor to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). In light of the above, and without prejudice to the other limitations indicated above, pursuant to article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code the maximum amount that a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Italy may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as a Guarantor under its Guarantee will not exceed 150% of the amount of the Additional Notes (or its equivalent in any other currency).",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among others, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Ministerial Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group is not considered as carried out vis-à-vis the public, and as a result does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Guarantor and the entity in favor of which the relevant guarantee is given being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. Italian corporate law (Articles 2497-quinquies and 2467 of the Italian Civil Code) provides for rules to protect creditors against “undercapitalized companies” and provides for remedies in respect thereof. In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company, (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person, or (iii) a quota holder in the case of a company 313 ----- incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, some court precedents have held that Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are società per azioni. Additionally, according, inter alia, to certain recent case law of the Italian Supreme Court, the above subordination rule of intercompany loans would apply also during the life of the company and not only in case of the opening of a voluntary or insolvency liquidation and, as a consequence, the company (and the relevant directors) should not repay intercompany loans granted in presence of the conditions described above set out by Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code, until the situation of “undercapitalization” (as described above) is overcome by the relevant company. Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries (including the Guarantor), which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Additional Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Additional Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted. Pursuant to Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code, any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a bankruptcy declaration would be required to be returned to the borrower. However, such part of Article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code has been repealed by the Code (as defined in “— _Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations” below) which will become effective as of August 15, 2020. In_ this respect, Article 164 of the Code shall provide that repayments of loans granted by the shareholders to the company (in the situations described above as provided under Article 2467, second paragraph, of the Italian Civil Code) are ineffective vis-à-vis the other creditors if made after the filing of the request following which an insolvency proceeding has been opened or in the previous year and that the same provision applies to repayments of loans granted in favour of the company subject to bankruptcy (liquidazione giudiziale) by a person that exercises management and coordination powers (attività di direzione e coordinamento) over that borrowing company or any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person. Article 164 of the Code does not expressly refer to companies incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata only. Additionally, according to Article 292 of the Code, receivables (also deriving from the enforcement of guarantees) owed by a company to the person that exercises management and coordination powers (attività di _direzione e coordinamento) over that company or owed by the latter to the relevant company (i.e., up-stream_ financings) deriving from financings entered into after the filing of the request following which the bankruptcy has been opened or in the previous year are subordinated to the satisfaction of the other creditors (unless such financing falls into the categories of super priority financings (finanziamenti prededucibili) described in section “Interim financing” below) and that, if such receivables have been repaid in the year preceding the opening of the bankruptcy (liquidazione giudiziale), Article 164, described above, applies. Article 292 of the Code does not expressly refer to: (i) companies incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata only; and (ii) financings granted in a situation of “undercapitalization.” In any case, it should be noted that the Code has not come into effect yet and no case law nor significant scholars are available in relation to the above new provisions of law regulating intercompany loans and consequently the description above and the interpretation of the above provisions of law (also as to their connection with other general provisions of law) remain subject to some, unavoidable, degree of uncertainty. 314 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In October 2017, new general rules and principles of Italian insolvency law were enacted, as guidelines for the new Italian code of corporate crisis and insolvency (hereinafter, the “Code”). The Code was enacted by Italian legislative decree no. 14 of January 12, 2019, but most of the relevant provisions of law will be effective as of August 15, 2020. The provisions of the Code (with a few exceptions) will not be applicable before August 15, 2020. Also, they have not been tested to date in the Italian courts and their interpretation is uncertain. Furthermore, we expect that the Code will be further and significantly amended and supplemented prior to its date of becoming effective (i.e. August 15, 2020) and the interpretation of the relevant provisions thereof could change from time to time. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, no guidance, official position or interpretation has been provided or taken by the Italian legislator, by any court or by any other competent authority in Italy. The drafts of the legislation available before the date of its enactment do not offer any assistance in the interpretation of the provisions of the Code, the drafting of which is, in several aspects, very different and totally new in comparison to the previously applicable Italian insolvency legislation. In general terms, the Code offers more efficient, early and flexible corporate reorganization and restructuring tools aimed at business continuity, where possible. The new rules and provisions of the Code are aimed at ensuring, among other things: (i) earlier emersion of the distress situation, through certain preventive restructuring remedies (early warning); (ii) concordato preventivo (composition with creditors) proceedings as a tool for restructurings based on business continuity (as opposed to liquidation); (iii) a new concept of judicial liquidation, with a replacement of the expression fallimento (bankruptcy); (iv) more fast and cost effective crisis and insolvency proceedings, on the basis of a single judicial process; and (v) special rules on the insolvency and restructuring of group companies. In the following paragraphs we will outline some of the new provisions of law set forth by the Code, bearing in mind that they could be further amended and supplemented by the Italian legislator, even prior August 15, 2020. The two primary aims of Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16, 1942 (the main Italian bankruptcy legislation), as amended and currently in force (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) are to liquidate the debtor’s assets protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) or the satisfaction of creditors’ claims as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been recently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. Only corporations whose indebtedness and assets values exceed certain thresholds are subjected to bankruptcy proceeding (as further indicated). Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020) new provisions of law are aimed at managing situations of crisis or insolvency of group companies, considering that single and separate proceedings may be prejudicial to the restructuring and recovery of the group, as well as to business continuity. In particular, it is allowed the filing of a unique petition for composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement, on the basis of either a unique plan, or different, but related and connected plans (one for each group entity), in order to ensure full cooperation and coordination of proceedings, as well as a better satisfaction of creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the general principle of separation of assets and liabilities of each entity of the group is still applicable, but it could be mitigated in the event the plan provides certain acts (including intra-group transfers), provided that an independent expert certifies that such acts are required for the purposes of the business continuity, and aimed at a more profitable distribution to all creditors. The new rules and provisions of the Code are aimed at ensuring, among other things, an earlier emersion of the distress situation, through certain preventive restructuring remedies. In this framework, the Code provides for early warning tools and crisis management proceedings, which are out-of-court, confidential legal mechanisms. 315 ----- In particular, early warning tools are alert obligations upon certain subjects and entities, which are aimed at a prompt detection of crisis indicators, as well as a quick adoption of the more appropriate measures, in addition to the internal organizational models adopted by the companies and their corporate bodies. The crisis indicators could be any economic or financial imbalances, also considering the dimension and history of the company, and the kind of business activity carried out by the same, arising from certain indexes of business continuity and sustainability of debts for a certain timeframe. Early warning tools are activated through a notice sent by: - the control bodies (internal auditors or external auditors, where provided) to the directors of the company, with a short term for the adoption of the required remedies; lacking any reply or action from the directors, the control bodies shall inform the so called OCRI (i.e., “Organismo di Composizione della Crisi d’Impresa”), an independent body for the management of crisis situations; or - qualified public creditors (e.g., Tax Agencies and Social Securities Contributions Authority) to the debtor, in the event of indebtedness exceeding certain indebtedness thresholds; if the indebtedness is not cured, or actions are not taken by the debtor within a certain timeframe, the above mentioned creditors shall inform OCRI. OCRI is entitled to summon the debtor and, if a crisis situation occurs, to suggest any possible measures to be adopted further to an out-of-court, confidential and quick process. In the framework of such crisis management proceedings, the same debtor may request OCRI to facilitate an agreement with creditors aimed at the restructuring of the indebtedness. In any event, the same debtor is entitled to promptly request the opening of a confidential crisis management proceedings before the OCRI, also in order to benefit from certain reward measures. In addition to the above, the following pre-insolvency proceedings are currently available under Italian law for companies facing financial difficulties or temporary cash flow shortfalls and, in general, financial distress. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for three models of pre-insolvency proceedings: (i) court pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo),_ (ii) debt restructuring agreements (accordi _di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) (“DRA”); and (iii) certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento)_ (“CRP”). Under the EU Insolvency Regulation both pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo) and DRA are listed in the relevant Annex A._ It should be noted that all of the above-mentioned pre-insolvency proceedings often require creditors to compromise on their right to be fully satisfied. The debtor may offer to creditors partial settlement of their claims.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
226_2,Offerings 2019.md,1138,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1138.9,Italy,1138.9.8,Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process,"Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favorable to the debtor and because out-of-court arrangements put in place as a result of an out-of-court restructuring (other than those put in place under the safe harbor of an out-of-court reorganization CRP pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which exempts—provided all actions indicated in the plan are fully implemented—from insolvency claw-back and from certain criminal law provisions on bankruptcy those transactions executed as part of the CRP) are vulnerable to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions, and may trigger civil or criminal liabilities in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy. _Certified Restructuring Plans Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (piani attestati di risanamento)_ Out-of-court CRPs are based on restructuring plans prepared by debtors for the purpose of restructuring their indebtedness and ensuring the recovery of their financial condition, the feasibility of which, together with the truthfulness of debtor’s business (and accounting) data, must be assessed by an independent expert directly appointed by the debtor. The expert can only be selected and appointed from among those possessing certain specific professional requisites and qualifications (e.g., being registered in the auditors’ registrar), and meeting the requirements under Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code. The expert may be subject to civil and criminal liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. CRPs are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or other supervising authority. CRPs do not require to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. Following a CRP, there is no entrusting of a business to another entity; therefore, the debtor remains entitled (during the negotiation as well as the execution of the CRP) to manage its business. 316 ----- The terms and conditions of the CRPs are freely negotiable. Unlike in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) and DRA proceedings, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors (in particular during the CRPs negotiation). The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of CRP, subject to certain conditions (i) are not subject to claw-back actions; and (ii) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies’ register are needed (although, upon request of the debtor, a CRP can be published in the relevant companies’ register), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020) the CRP shall have the following requirements: (a) certain date (“data certa”); (b) detailed description of the plan, on a legal and economic standpoint; and (c) need of a new certification from an independent expert in the event of amendments to the plan, as well as of adjustment mechanisms. _Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ Out-of-court DRAs entered into with creditors representing at least 60% of the outstanding company’s debts must be ratified (omologati) by a court. An independent expert, directly appointed by the debtor, must assess—in addition to the truthfulness of the debtor’s business and accounting data—that the agreement is feasible and, in particular, that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within 120 days from (i) the ratification (omologazione) of the DRA by the court, in case the relevant claims are already due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the ratification of the DRA by the court or (ii) from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case the relevant claims are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the ratification (omologazione) of the DRA by the court. Only a debtor who is in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate such process and request the court’s confirmation (omologazione) of the DRA, which must be entered into with creditors representing not less than 60% of the company’s debts. The DRA, which may consist of separate agreements reached with each creditor, must be published in the Italian companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. Starting from the date of such publication and for 60 days thereafter, creditors cannot start or continue any interim relief or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor in relation to pre-existing claims and cannot obtain any new and additional security interest (unless agreed) in relation to the pre-existing debts. Such moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor to the court pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the DRA’s execution and publication) subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. In such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium are in place and, if they are, orders that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the restructuring agreement has to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. A DRA may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain overdue taxes, as provided in Article 182-ter of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of DRA, easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness are 317 ----- entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75% of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”), subject to certain conditions being met, including that treatment of dissenting creditors is not worse than under any other available alternative. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25% of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75% of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the nonparticipating financial creditors, provided that an independent expert certifies the homogeneity of the classes and subject to certain conditions being met. The purpose is to prevent banks with modest credits from block restructuring operations involving more exposed bank creditors, resulting in the failure of the overall restructuring and the opening of a procedure. Financial creditors who did not participate in the agreement may challenge it within 30 days of receipt of the application. Such DRA and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g. trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved DRA (or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 percent of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a DRA or a court-supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or ratification (omologazione) of the agreement. Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the ratification (omologazione) of the agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, or after the filing of the petition pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, or a petition for a concordato preventivo, also pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, may authorize the debtor to: (i) incur new pre-deductible indebtedness subject to authorization by the court and if an expert certifies that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process, (ii) secure such indebtedness via in rem securities (garanzie reali), provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the ratification (omologazione), declares the aim of the new financial indebtedness results in a better satisfaction of the creditors; and (iii) pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that, the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, pending the ratification (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called pre-deducibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020), the percentage of 60% of creditors provided for the approval of the DRA could be halved to 30% in the event (i) the DRA does not provide a moratorium for external 318 ----- creditors, and (ii) the debtor did not request (and waives to) temporary protective measures. Furthermore, the certification of the independent expert shall be updated and renewed in the event significant amendments occur to the DRA and relevant plan. As a new provision of the Code, special rules would apply in the event of extension of the effects of a DRA to external creditors (at least equal to 75% of creditors of the concerned class), provided that: (a) creditors have been fully informed; (b) the plan is aimed at business continuity and creditors will be mainly paid with the proceeds arising from the continuation of business activities; and (c) external creditors are paid no less than in a liquidation scenario. With reference to the new rules on financings set forth by the Code, please refer to Section “Interim Financings” below. _Interim Financing_ The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors to also obtain authorization to receive urgent interim financing and to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee di credito autoliquidanti) necessary for their business needs before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy without the_ expert certification and through an accelerated review process by the relevant court, upon, inter alia, the relevant debtor’s declaration that interim finance is urgently needed and the debtor’s inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The court must decide on the request within ten days of the filing of the application after consultation with the judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. Before the entry into force of the Decree 83/2015, debtors could be granted financing with priority status (prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato _preventivo) or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an_ expert certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority status. Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020) new provisions of law have been enacted in relation to interim financings (including guarantees and self-liquidating credit lines) granted before the approval of the _concordato preventivo or DRA, in the event of continuation of business activities (even only for the purposes of_ liquidation), for a better satisfaction of creditors and with a priority status. The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. It is required the certification of an independent expert that such financing meets the above mentioned requirements, as well as that such financing is aimed to the best satisfaction of creditors, unless the Court states there is a matter of urgency in order to prevent an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the business. In the event of subsequent opening of liquidation proceedings, the financings will not enjoy the priority status if granted on the basis of false data, lack of information or fraudulent acts from the debtor, and awareness of such circumstances is proved. Furthermore, in the event of continuation of business activities also interim financings granted in execution of concordato preventivo or approved DRA (and expressly provided in the relevant plan) enjoy the priority status. In the event of subsequent opening of liquidation proceedings, the financings will not enjoy the priority status if granted on the basis of false data, lack of information or fraudulent acts from the debtor, and awareness of such circumstances is proved. Also financings (including guarantees) granted by shareholders meet priority status, up to 80% of the relevant value (100% of the relevant value if the financing party becomes shareholder in execution of concordato _preventivo or DRA)._ In the event of direction and coordination activity, any intercompany claims arising from financings granted after the filing of the petition for the opening of liquidation proceedings or during the preceding year, are subordinated to the satisfaction of the other creditors. Such claims are not effective vis-à-vis creditors if they have been returned during the year prior to the filing of the petition, or after such filing. _Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)_ A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (i.e. financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to 319 ----- compose its overall indebtedness or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a _concordato preventivo (together with, inter alia, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing_ the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before the sanctioning of the _concordato preventivo by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and_ interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it shall ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Law No. 98/2013 (“Law",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the,1138.10.1,Bankruptcy (fallimento),"A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) and the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by the debtor company itself, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori _commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in_ an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, among other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated 322 ----- judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor company and the management of its assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - any act of the debtor company done after a declaration of bankruptcy (including payments made) is ineffective against the creditors; - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy proceeding and costs related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee arrears of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law). Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020), the expression “fallimento” has been replaced by a new concept of judicial liquidation, on the basis of a more fast and effective proceedings, as well increased powers of the receiver and more focus on liquidation of assets and businesses.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the,1138.10.2,Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato fallimentare),"A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant proposal can be filed, by one or more creditors or third parties, from the declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are only permitted to file such proposal after one year following such declaration, but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The _concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the_ majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required.

The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the,1138.10.3,Statutory Priorities,"The statutory priority given to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from that established in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor 323 ----- the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of “pre-deductible” claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors including, inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing, mentioned above), the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priority claims are those of “privileged” creditors (creditori privilegiati; a priority in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgagees (creditori _ipotecari), pledgees (creditori prignoratizi) and unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari)._",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the,1138.10.4,Avoidance Powers in Insolvency,"Under Italian law, there are “clawback” or avoidance provisions that may lead to, inter alia, the revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defrauding creditors. Clawback rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy, compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the clawback period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions that are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions that are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. _Acts Ineffective by Operation of law_ (a) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without needing to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law; and (b) under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day of the declaration of insolvency or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if made by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. _Acts that Could be Declared Ineffective at the Request of the Bankruptcy Receiver/Court Commissioner_ (a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the above referenced Royal Decree and be declared ineffective unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (i) the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds by 25% the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration; 324 ----- (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year preceding the insolvency declaration in order to secure preexisting debts which have not yet fallen due; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration, in order to secure debts which had fallen due. (b) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: (i) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration; and (ii) the granting of security interests securing debts (even those of third parties) and made in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration. (c) The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions: (i) a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank in a material and lasting manner; (iii) a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a nonresidential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser, on the condition that, as of the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted with respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di risanamento _attestato (see “—Certified Restructuring Plans Pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (piani attestati di risanamento)” above);_ (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or security interest granted to implement a concordato _preventivo (see “—Court-Supervised Pre-Bankruptcy Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)” above) or a DRA under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (see “—Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)” above) and transactions entered into, payments made_ and security interests granted after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo (see above); (vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and (vii) a payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared without effect vis- à-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the creditor’s claim originated, such third party participated in the fraudulent scheme). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” claw-back action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ 325 ----- nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g. gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called fondo patrimoniale—“family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third party purchaser. _Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and commercial enterprises (the Prodi-bis procedure). The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings. There are two main phases: “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.” _Judicial Phase_ In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissiario _giudiziale) to investigate whether the company has serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or_ reorganization. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within ten days from such filing, the Italian Productive Activities Minister (the “Ministry”) may make an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. _Administrative Phase_ Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner (or commissioners) is appointed by the Ministry. The extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). The plan may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., a debt for equity swap, an issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred, etc.) (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner. In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan, failing which the company is declared bankrupt. _Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies (ristrutturazione industriale di grandi imprese in stato di insolvenza)_ Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the Marzano procedure. It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry is made together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt. The decision of whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. 326 ----- The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. _Compulsory Administrative Winding-Up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_ A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for certain companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made subject to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company. The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the,1138.10.5,,"latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the above-mentioned period. The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. Non-compliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. 320 ----- Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the ratification (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called pre-deducibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Law No. 9/2014 specified that the super-seniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuit`a aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the winding-up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who shall authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The composition with creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato _preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets_ (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the 321 ----- aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured clams (crediti _chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio),_ or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e. a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and ratified (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventive proposal by issuing a confirmation order. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. Under the Code (effective as of August 15, 2020), the concordato preventivo may still also be allowed as a liquidation tool, provided that certain conditions are met (i.e., new external financings granted so as to enable a certain level of recovery for creditors, and payment of at least 20% of creditors’ claims). Furthermore, in the _concordato preventivo aimed at preventing the insolvency declaration, and favoring business continuity, the_ Code provides the benefit of business continuity only in the event it would imply (i) a significant increase of the financial resources available to creditors, (ii) an employment level equal to at least half of the average number of employees in the past two years, for at least one year after the judicial approval, and (iii) the satisfaction of creditors mainly with the proceeds of the business continuity (including assignment of inventory).",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The Spanish full-blown insolvency proceeding (bankruptcy), which is referred to as “concurso de acreedores,” applies to all persons or entities (save for limited exceptions specifically contemplated in the Spanish Insolvency Act). These proceedings may lead either to reorganization through the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (the “Composition Agreement”) or to the liquidation of the debtor’s assets. _Insolvency Filing_ A debtor (in the case of a company, its directors) is required to file the bankruptcy petition upon inability to regularly pay its liabilities as they become due. The debtor is also entitled (but not required) to apply for such insolvency proceedings when it foresees its inability to regularly pay liabilities as they become due. Creditors do also have standing to petition bankruptcy when the debtor is unable to regularly pay its debts as they come due. Bankruptcy is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. If the debtor requests the bankruptcy, it must prove its current or imminent insolvency. The debtor must file a petition for bankruptcy within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency (inability to regularly pay the debts as they come due). It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proven, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Where the debtor fails to file a petition for bankruptcy within the time period established by law (two months), (i) the directors may be removed from office and substituted by a bankruptcy authority once the bankruptcy is declared and the bankruptcy process is initiated; (ii) the debtor may be unable to exercise certain courses of action (including, inter alia, the possibility of submitting a pre-arranged settlement proposal); and 327 ----- (iii) the directors may be held liable for the impaired claims accrued as from the consent of insolvency, should the debtor be liquidated and bankruptcy be classified as “guilty.” Bankruptcy is considered mandatory or involuntary (concurso necesario) if filed by a third party. Under article 2.4 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, a creditor can seek a debtor’s declaration of insolvency if it can prove that the debtor has failed to attach any assets, or sufficient assets, to pay the amount owed. A creditor may also apply for a debtor’s insolvency if it can prove to the court: (i) a generalized default on payments by the debtor; (ii) a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor’s assets; (iii) a misplacement, “fire sale,” hasty, loss-making or ruinous liquidation of the debtor’s assets; or (iv) a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e. three months). _Pre-Insolvency Filing_ Spanish law currently contains a restructuring moratorium proceeding known as article 5.bis pre-bankruptcy proceeding, which is an insolvency proceeding under both Spanish and European regulation. It protects the debtor, for a four-months period, from petitions for involuntary cases. The general duty to file for bankruptcy within the referred two-months period does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable Court that it has initiated negotiations with its creditors to obtain support to reach a pre-arranged composition agreement (propuesta de convenio anticipado) or an out-of-court workout (a refinancing agreement) set out in Section 71.bis.1 or in the Fourth Additional Disposition of the Spanish Insolvency Act (the so-called 5 bis communication). Effectively, by means of the 5 bis communication, on the top of those two months, the debtor gains an additional three-months period as from the date when the debtor gives such notice, to achieve an agreement with its creditors or to obtain accessions to an anticipated composition agreement and one further month to file for bankruptcy, if after the above mentioned period of three months has elapsed without an agreement being reached and the situation of insolvency persists. During such period of time, creditors’ petitions for involuntary cases will not be accepted. Additionally, during the four-month protection period provided for by 5. bis notice (or three months according to certain case law), enforcement will be prevented: (i) by creditors, other than public, over assets which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business; and (ii) by financial creditors referred to in the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act over any asset, provided financial creditors holding at least 51% of the financial indebtedness (by value) of the insolvent debtor have expressed their will to commence negotiations in order to reach a refinancing agreement and have committed not to initiate or continue enforcement proceedings against the debtor. Further, any outstanding enforcement action which falls into the above categories that was commenced before the filing for a pre-insolvency moratorium will be suspended.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In this regard: - Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Section 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish Courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance (and in any event if it is deemed to be disproportionate according to the good faith principle). There is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive damages. - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties. 328 ----- - Spanish law, as applied by the Spanish Supreme Court, precludes an agreement being terminated on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements), and allows Spanish Courts not to enforce any such termination. - Under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In the case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule, the debtor’s management will be replaced (sustitución) by the insolvency trustee. However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency trustee’s request, the court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the bankruptcy authorities may be declared null and void. _Effects on Contracts_ Bankruptcy declaration does not affect contracts with reciprocal obligations pending performance by both parties by bankruptcy declaration (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvent estate (con cargo a la masa). The Court can nonetheless terminate (reject) any such contracts at the request of the insolvency trustee (provided that management’s powers have been solely conferred upon the insolvency trustee), the company itself (if its powers to manage and dispose of its business are only subject to the intervention of the insolvency trustee) when such termination is in the interest of the estate (resolución del contrato en interés del concurso), or terminate for breach at the request of the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such contract. The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return consideration received or indemnify its counterparty against the insolvency estate. On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the insolvent debtor at its request or the insolvency trustee’s request (assumption) (mantenimiento del contrato en _interés del concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall have a estate claim._ Creditors will be able to accelerate, but not to terminate executory contracts based only on bankruptcy declaration (declaración de concurso) of the debtor. All clauses in contracts with mutual obligations that entitle any party to terminate an agreement based solely on the other party’s declaration of insolvency (ipso facto clauses) are deemed as not included in the agreement (void) and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws). Additionally, bankruptcy declaration suspends interest accrual, except for: (a) Postpetition interests, which are only payable to secured creditors (up to the value of the collateral) where those were included as contingent debt in the proof of claims (Spanish Supreme Court ruling of February 20, 2019) and insofar the interest refer to ordinary, but not to default interest (Spanish Supreme Court ruling April 11, 2019). These two Spanish Supreme Court rulings have given rise to a significant degree of controversy (pending to see whether this new line or argumentation is confirmed or fine-tuned, and whether there is any say on the retroactive effects); and (b) any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding Law of the State Budget (Ley de Presupuestos del Estado). In any event, setoff is prohibited unless the requirements for the setoff were satisfied prior to the declaration of insolvency or the claim of the insolvent debtor is governed by a law that permits set-off. As a general rule, bankruptcy declaration stays, up to a year, enforcement proceedings tied to collateral necessary to pursue the ordinary course (excluding financial collateral, as defined in Royal Decree Law 5/2005, which can be enforced as any time, and where the collateral is located outside of Spain). 329 ----- The enforcement of any security over certain assets that are necessary to the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities) is prohibited until the earlier of: (i) an arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the composition agreement does not affect such right; or (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of the liquidation phase. Nevertheless, shares/quota shares held by an insolvent debtor in another company whose only activity is the holding of a material asset and servicing the financing provided in connection with the acquisition of that asset, are not considered to be an asset necessary for the debtor’s business activity as long as the foreclosure of the relevant security interest that has been granted over such shares/quota shares does not bring about an early termination or amendment of the contractual relations permitting the economic exploitation of the relevant asset. When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is, then, legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor or administrative law). _Ranking of Credits_ The judge’s insolvency order contains an express request for creditors to declare debts owed to them within a one-month period following the last official publication in the Official State Gazette (Boletín Oficial del _Estado) of the court order declaring the insolvency (proof of claims), by providing original documentation that_ justifies their claims. Based on such documentation provided by the creditors and held by the debtor, the insolvency trustee draws up a list of acknowledged claims and classifies them according to the categories established under law, which are as follows: (i) claims against the debtor’s estate; (ii) claims benefiting from special privileges; (iii) claims benefiting from general privileges; (iv) ordinary claims; and (v) subordinated claims. (a) Claims against the insolvency estate (créditos contra la masa) from Section 84 of the Spanish Insolvency Act sets out the so-called “estate claims” which are pre-deductible claims from the estate (excluding those assets of the insolvent debtor subject to in rem security), are generally payable when due according to their own terms (and, therefore, are paid before other claims). Debt against the insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts deriving from executory contracts and obligations to return and indemnify in cases of voluntary termination or breach by the insolvent debtor, (iv) those amounts that derive from the exercise of a clawback action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the insolvent debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it, if tied to bilateral contracts (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from tort liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion, (vi) certain debts incurred by the debtor following the declaration of insolvency; (vii) in case of liquidation, the credit rights granted to the debtor under a Composition Agreements in accordance with article 100.5 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, (viii) 50% of the new funds lent under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act; and (ix) the new funds lent by persons being in a special relationship with the debtor in the context of a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act, provided further that such new funds do not result from a share capital increase, loans or acts with analogous purpose. (b) Claims benefiting from special privileges, representing security on certain assets (essentially in rem _security). Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security, provided that such security is listed in the_ creditors’ list (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset determined in accordance with the rules provided for in the Spanish Insolvency Act minus senior claims). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year from the declaration of the insolvency and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Act. However, within such waiting period or while any enforcement proceedings remain suspended under the Spanish Insolvency Act, the insolvency trustee has the option to pay the relevant claims against the insolvency estate under specific payment rules. Privileged creditors are not subject to 330 ----- Composition Agreement, unless they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding security which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of secured claims of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the secured assets on which they are secured. (c) Claims benefiting from general privileges include, among others, certain labor debts and certain debts with public administrations. Other debts with public administrations corresponding to tax debts and social security obligations and debts held by the creditor applying for the corresponding insolvency proceedings, to the extent such application has been approved, are recognized as privileged for up to 50% of the amount of such debts. New funds under a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (crédito _contra la masa) will also be credits with general privileges. The holders of general privileges are not to_ be affected by the restructuring (under a Composition Agreement) except if they give their express support by voting in favor of the Composition Agreement or, in the case they do not give such express support, if creditors holding claims benefiting from general privileges which represent at least 60% (or 75% depending on the conditions of the composition agreement) of the total value of claims benefiting from general privileges of the same class vote in favor of such composition agreement. If they do not agree to the arrangement and, in the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment (in the order established by law). (d) Ordinary claims (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) will be paid on a pro-rated basis from the proceeds of the assets not subject to secured claims, former pre-deduction of estate claims and generally privileged claims. (e) Subordinated claims are thus classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor. In the case of individuals, this includes their relatives, legal entities controlled by the debtor or its relatives, the factual or legal administrators of such legal entities, any other legal entity forming part of the same group of companies and the legal entities in respect of which the people described in this paragraph are their factual and legal administrators. In the case of a legal entity, the following shall be deemed as “specially related parties”: (i) shareholders with unlimited liability (in case such shareholders are natural persons it would include any specially related party to these shareholders, as described herein); (ii) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company’s share capital (or 5% if the company is listed)—when the shareholder is an individual, those who would be specially related to the individual are also specially related to the debtor; or (iii) directors (either de jure or de facto), liquidators and those holding general powers of attorney from the insolvent company (including those people that have held these position during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration); and (iv) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (ii) above. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a refinancing arrangement entered into in compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 71.bis or the 4th Additional Provision of the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such refinancing arrangement. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors: they do not vote on the Composition Agreement and in the event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Act (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full). _Hardening Periods_ There is no automatic claw-back by virtue of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of initiation of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency trustee may only challenge those transactions that could be deemed as being “detrimental” to the insolvent debtor’s estate, 331 ----- provided that they have taken place within two years prior to bankruptcy declaration, even in the absence of fraudulent intent (in accordance with Article 71.7 of the Spanish Insolvency Act, transactions taking place four years before the insolvency declaration are subject to the general regime of rescission set forth in the Spanish Civil Code). “Detriment” does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interests. Pursuant to the law, (a) detriment exists (as a non-rebuttable presumption, without admission of proof to the contrary) in the case of (i) disposals without consideration, except for ordinary largesse (liberalidades de uso) and (ii) early payment of unsecured obligations maturing after the insolvency declaration (except secured claims); and (b) detriment is deemed to exist (as a rebuttable presumption) in the case of (i) transactions entered into with parties that have a special relationship with the debtor, (ii) the creation of in rem rights in order to secure pre-existing obligations or those incurred to replace existing obligations and (iii) the cancellation of obligations secured by an in rem security falling due after the declaration of insolvency. In the remaining cases, detriment would have to be evidenced by the party seeking rescission. Guarantees or security interests granted by a Spanish company in favor of a third party, to secure other group companies’ debt may be subject to clawback, on the basis that such guarantees or security interests may be considered as detrimental to the guarantor’s estate, if the guarantor is not able to show that there was a tangible and identifiable corporate benefit for the guarantor to grant such guarantee or security (beyond an abstract group interest or general mentions to pertinence to the same group of companies or the so-called “group interest”). Whether or not the granting of any upstream guarantee or security by the guarantor is detriment to the guarantor’s estate is a factual matter that will need to be proven on a case by case basis (the beneficiary of the guarantee bearing the burden of such proof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Spanish case law recognizes the validity of upstream guarantees. If a rescission action is successful, restoration of the assets that are the subject of the transaction, together with the proceeds and interest, will be ordered by the judge. If the assets cannot be restored to the debtor, the counterparty to the insolvent debtor must pay an amount in cash equal to the value of the assets at the time of their disposal, plus interest. If the judge rules that the transaction has been conducted in bad faith, the liable party will be obligated to indemnify the debtor for loss and damages suffered as its claim will be classified as subordinated. If the judge does not conclude that the transaction was conducted in bad faith, the counterparty to the debtor will settle its credit simultaneously with the restoration of the assets and rights to the insolvency estate as per bilateral contracts. The exercise of rescission actions does not prevent other actions against the debtor in accordance with law, which may be brought before the bankruptcy judge. Under no circumstances can be rescinded: (i) ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of the business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out under market conditions; (ii) actions contemplated in the specific legislation regarding systems of payment, set-off or liquidation of values and derivative instruments; and (iii) guarantees constituted in favor of Public Law credits or credits in favor of the labor authorities. Neither “Refinancing Agreements,” nor any transactions, acts and payments accomplished or any guarantees instituted in the performance of such “Refinancing Agreements,” will be subject to an action for rescission, provided that they comply with the requirements set out below in section ‘Protection of Certain Refinancing Agreements’ and they have been sanctioned (homologado) by the competent Court.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - such act was fraudulent; 332 ----- - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code: (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a juris et de jure presumption (cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a juris tantum presumption (a rebuttable presumption). If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements will not be subject to the bankruptcy claw-back action, but they may be challenged pursuant to general fraudulent conveyance law. As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the refinancing agreement if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan, or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement. Whether or not dissidents can be extended effects beyond those provided by the law or object to homologation, and whether they have standing to object to homologation, is controversial. 333 ----- The following cramdown effects of homologated refinancing agreements may be imposed on (i) dissenting or non-participating unsecured financial creditors including secured financial creditors to the extent of that part of their secured claim not covered by their security interest, as such security interest is to be valued in accordance with the rules set out by the latest reform of the Spanish Insolvency Act and (ii) dissenting secured creditors in respect of their secured claims, provided they achieve the thresholds mentioned below: (a) If the judicially sanctioned refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 60% of the debtor’s financial liabilities, stays of payments may be granted for up to five years or the debt converted into so-called profit participation loans (préstamos participativos) of term up to five years. Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 65% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor. (b) If the homologated refinancing agreement is supported by creditors representing at least 75% of the debtor’s aggregate financial liabilities: (i) stays of payments for up to ten years; (ii) haircuts; (iii) capitalization of debt. Nevertheless, those creditors that have not supported such refinancing agreement (either because they did not sign the agreement or because they oppose it) may choose between (i) the debt for equity swap contemplated by the agreement; or, as default option, (ii) a discharge of their claims equal to the nominal amount (including any share premium) of the shares/quota shares that would have corresponded to that creditor as a consequence of the relevant debt for equity swap; (iv) conversion of debt into profit participation loans of up to ten years, convertible obligations, subordinated loans, payment in kind facilities, or in any other financial instrument with a ranking, maturity and features different to the original debt; and (v) assignment of assets or rights as assignment in kind for total or partial payment of the debt (datio _pro solute or datio pro solvendo)._ Further, these effects may be extended to the amount of secured claims of non-participating or dissenting creditors, when the agreement has been entered into by financial creditors holding secured claims which represent at least 80% of the value of all secured claims of the debtor.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee or security agreement, and the nullity or termination of the primary obligation entails the nullity or termination of the ancillary guarantee or security interest. Consequently, if the primary obligation terminated, the ancillary guarantee or security interest will also be deemed null and void. In the event that the guarantor or security 334 ----- provider is able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed or secured obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the guarantor or security provider’s obligations under the relevant guarantee or security agreement are not enforceable. In addition, a guarantee or security interest may not be enforced in Spain without having validly accelerated (totally or partially, as applicable) the underlying agreements governing the guaranteed or secured obligations, and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the secured obligations. A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default were of minimal importance. To be recognized by the Spanish courts as giving rise to the remedy of acceleration, a default must be material. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would not be permitted by article 1,256 of the Spanish Civil Code. Moreover, Spanish law may limit the ability of a Spanish Guarantor to guarantee the Additional Notes or to grant security interests over its assets to secure the Additional Notes. Recent Spanish rulings which do not constitute settled case law indicate, and certain scholars understand, that risk associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to guarantee or secure indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group must be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Spanish company’s perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are rulings from the Spanish Supreme Court recognizing the validity of upstream guarantees. Furthermore, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under its Additional Notes Guarantee or under any security instrument granted by it cannot extend to any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute a breach of the Spanish financial assistance rules. Pursuant to these rules, the obligations of the Spanish Guarantor under the Additional Notes Guarantee or any security granted or executed by such Spanish Guarantor: - shall not extend to any use of the proceeds of the Additional Notes for the purpose of acquiring shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company, or refinancing a previous debt incurred for the acquisition of shares representing the share capital of such Spanish Guarantor or shares representing the share capital of its direct or indirect parent company; and - shall be deemed not to be undertaken or incurred by the Spanish Guarantor to the extent that the same would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and Article 143 of the Spanish Companies Law and, in that case, all provisions of such Additional Notes Guarantee or security shall be construed accordingly in the sense that in no case can any Additional Notes Guarantee or security given by the Spanish Guarantor provides any such unlawful financial assistance. Spanish law prohibits financial assistance: (i) for public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas _(S.A.)) in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect parent company,_ and (ii) for private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, Spanish law governed guarantees or security interests granted or assumed by subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish subsidiary or the shares of its direct or indirect parent company or, as applicable, any member of their group, to the extent that such security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 150 and 143 of Spanish Decree 1/2010 dated July 2 on Spanish Corporations (Ley de _Sociedades de Capital). This limitation may also apply to the refinancing of acquisition debt, although this is_ widely debated between academics. Accordingly, any guarantee or security interest granted by any Spanish subsidiary shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for the purposes described above. No whitewash procedures are available. Accordingly, the guarantee granted by any Spanish company will be limited by the amount of the funds that are not used for unlawful financial assistance purposes. Under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when guarantees are enforced. For example, when the enforcement of the guarantee causes the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency. In addition, and whilst this remains a matter debated between Spanish scholars, it is possible that certain defenses available to the Spanish Guarantor relating to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, 335 ----- voidable preference, capital preservation or thin capitalization may limit the amount guaranteed under the Additional Notes Guarantee by reference to the net assets and share capital of the Spanish Guarantor and the amount secured under the relevant security agreement by reference to the value of the collateral. Under the Spanish Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se aprueba el _texto refundido de la Ley, de Sociedades de Capital), Spanish companies (both public limited liability companies_ (sociedades anónimas (S.A.) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada _(S.L.)) may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that_ recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de _responsabilidad limitada (S.L.)). In particular, pursuant to Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act, the_ Guarantee provided by Spanish Guarantors incorporated under the form of limited liability companies (“sociedades de responsabilidad limitada” or “S.L.s”), is subject to the following restrictions: (a) S.L.s can only issue and guarantee notes up to an aggregate maximum amount of twice its own equity (recursos propios), unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution (b) S.L.s are prohibited to issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales). In respect of the restrictions applicable to limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad _limitada (S.L.)), there is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding the_ interpretation of Section 401 of the Spanish Companies Act. Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (five years being the general term established for obligations in personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off or counterclaim. The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: - the nature of the remedies available; and - the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) setoff (unless validly waived), circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, abatement and counterclaim. Spanish law does not recognize the concepts of “trust” or “security agent” and there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of a security agent (including the Security Agent) and whether this would cause delays in the enforcement and the consequences of not being able to enforce the collateral as provided in the relevant security agreements. Although this by itself does not prohibit appointing the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, the absence of regulation creates uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee’s actions in an enforcement situation. Some legal scholars argue that a security agent (such as the Security Agent) or a trustee (such as the applicable Trustee) would only be entitled to enforce its portion of the secured obligation but not that of the other secured parties. Therefore, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, and enforcement thereof by the Security Agent and/or the applicable Trustee, may be subject to a due and express power of attorney granted by each of the secured parties in favor of the Security Agent and/or the Trustee for such purpose, duly notarized and legalized (and, if applicable, duly apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention of October 5, 1961). Likewise, validity and enforceability of security interests granted in favor of the secured parties through the Security Agent, in its capacity as joint and several creditor (acreedor solidario) of the secured parties, has not been tested before the Spanish courts. Moreover, the structure of joint and several creditor is not expressly contemplated under Spanish law in a situation in which the joint and several creditor does not hold a portion of the secured obligation itself. As a result, the ability of the Security Agent to represent the applicable Trustee and the holders of the Additional Notes may be challenged. According to Spanish law, the law governing in rem legal aspects of a pledge is the law applicable in the place of location of the pledged asset (lex rei sitae). When the pledged asset is a credit right—such as receivables or intercompany loans—the determination of the lex rei sitae is unclear given its lack of physical existence. In these cases, several theories have been construed amongst Spanish scholars so as to determine the lex rei sitae (such as domicile of debtor of the credit rights being pledged, domicile of pledgor, law governing the credit right 336 ----- being pledged, etc.). If a judge considered that any of the pledges created over credit rights under the Spanish security documents is governed by the Catalonian Civil Code, then this regulation would govern those pledges instead of the Spanish civil common law, which could determine the challenge of the validity of such pledges. The concept of “parallel debt” may be questioned under Spanish law and we are not aware of any court precedent where it has been recognized by a Spanish Court. Without notarization of the security documents, the secured parties will not have access to the executive summary proceedings (juicio ejecutivo) in case of judicial enforcement of the security documents in Spain, having the secured parties to follow necessarily the ordinary judicial proceedings (juicio ordinario).",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control of the company and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets.

Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months from commencement but may, and often is, extended for several additional three-month-periods. An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day to day activities and safeguards the interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required. However, if the debtor fails to comply with the restrictions it will not affect the validity of such actions taken. The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor. The Reorganization Act, rather, contains specific rules that restrict termination of contracts due to breaches of contractual obligations that occurred prior to the instigation of the reorganization and, during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent or with a Swedish law pledge over a loan which is documented by a negotiable debt instrument (löpande skuldebrev). The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (offentligt ackord), which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors that are allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition.

The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type. A Swedish share pledge agreement is perfected when the share certificate(s) representing the pledged shares have been transferred to the pledgee’s possession or, if the share certificate(s) are held by a third party, when the third party is notified of the pledge. In practice, a pledge over shares is made through the delivery of share certificates duly endorsed in blank (to facilitate enforcement). A notice is given by the pledgor to the company and the pledge is then registered in the company’s share register. A Swedish intra-group loan pledge agreement is perfected by a notification to the debtor from the pledgor or the pledgee. For the pledge to be perfected, the pledgor must also be deprived of any control over the collateral (i.e. the contractual right to receive payments). If the receivables are evidenced by negotiable instruments, it may be possible to perfect the pledge without a notification to the debtors. A pledge of a negotiable instrument is perfected when the instrument is transferred to the pledgee’s possession or, if the instrument is held by a third party, when the third party is notified of the pledge. As the Swedish law intra-group pledge agreement permits payments of both principal and interest to the pledgor until an acceleration event has occurred, that security will remain unperfected until the occurrence of an acceleration event and the satisfaction of the above perfection requirements. Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event (or similar), such as the security over the intra-group loans described in the preceding paragraph, would therefore not be effective until an enforcement event has occurred and the security interests have been duly perfected. Such unperfected secured assets are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider. Thus, a security provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the secured assets, and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with the disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity of the security. 339 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In the event of any such Swiss Guarantor’s insolvency, insolvency proceedings may, therefore, be initiated in Switzerland and Swiss insolvency law would then govern those proceedings. The insolvency and bankruptcy laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) (DEBA) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in force. Under Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept (with the exception of limited coordination of related proceedings occurring in Switzerland by the involved authorities), which means there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency laws point of view, to be dealt with separately, although proceeding of group companies occurring simultaneously in Switzerland are coordinated where possible. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. Under Swiss bankruptcy law, bankruptcy proceedings are not initiated by the competent court ex officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings based on an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings and the threat of insolvency. Proceedings must generally be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency law in the event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently, or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also initiate bankruptcy proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to Swiss corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the “CO”) and on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn up (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii) to the extent there is still a going concern scenario—based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going concern values, the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the competent court, provided that creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the over-indebtedness (Art. 725 CO). However, as soon as the debtor loses the going concern assumption for accounting purposes, going concern values become irrelevant and over-indebtedness is assessed solely based on liquidation values. While the criterion of over-indebtedness is based on a balance sheet test (rather than a liquidity test), it is important to note that a debtor’s inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due will cause the debtor to lose the going concern assumption for accounting 340 ----- purposes and lead to an obligation to account for liquidation values. This, in turn, will typically result in overindebtedness. The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to notify the competent court without delay and non-compliance with this obligation exposes board of directors to both damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. The debtor’s board of directors need not file for bankruptcy if (i) creditors with claims in an aggregate amount no lower than the amount of the debtor’s over-indebtedness subordinate their claims against the claims of all other creditors, or (ii) if there is a substantiated likelihood for an informal (i.e., out-of-court) workout within a relatively short period of time. It is not settled in Swiss case law as to how long such period of time is supposed to be. However, many legal scholars consider such period to be four to six weeks. Finally, the debtor’s auditors have the obligation to notify the competent court if the debtor’s board of directors has failed to file for bankruptcy despite the debtor being obviously over-indebted. The competent court, upon being notified of the over-indebtedness, opens formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) against the debtor unless there are prospects of recovery in which case measures to preserve the assets of the debtor are ordered. If a creditor wants to initiate bankruptcy proceedings it has to first file an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or resident (although, in special cases, other debt collection offices can be competent). The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is virtually no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No reasons need to be given for the objection. The debt collection office notifies the creditor of the objection. For claims based on an enforceable judgment (including, among others, judicial settlements and orders), the creditor can without any further delay file an application to lift this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court proceedings for negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage). The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to issue a writ of continuation (Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent debt collection office delivers this writ of continuation to the debtor. The competent court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor’s rights. Within 20 days from receipt of the threat of insolvency (Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition the opening of bankruptcy proceedings. The competent court decides upon the bankruptcy without any delay, provided that there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the competent court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the competent court. The competent court orders the continuation of bankruptcy proceedings if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the competent court will only order to continue bankruptcy proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the bankruptcy proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des _Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the debt collection office may request the competent court to_ resolve upon summary bankruptcy proceedings (summarisches Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary bankruptcy proceedings and the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Also, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary bankruptcy proceedings. Upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse), provided that certain acts require the approval of the competent court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate. The creditors’ committee has additional competences. Bankruptcy results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy 341 ----- claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not yet due and not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of bankruptcy, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon bankruptcy, interest ceases to accrue. Only secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings in Switzerland. Swiss bankruptcy proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest (except in case of full title security as security assignments or transfers for security purposes (Sicherungsübereignungen)) outside the bankruptcy proceedings. In the bankruptcy proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security is vested with the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss bankruptcy laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors (with respect to the proceeds of their respective collateral) and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal bankruptcy proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate. Thereafter, all other claims (bankruptcy claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss bankruptcy laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for the government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate after the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full. As an alternative solution to bankruptcy, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may seek a composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court (Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a tentative reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium provisionally (provisorische _Stundung) for a maximum period of four months or not, which may be followed by a definitive moratorium_ (definitive Nachlassstundung) of four to six months (extendable in special circumstances of up to 24 months). With its decision the court appoints a commissioner provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case during the period of the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court approves the moratorium definitely and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where deemed necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) for the purpose of supervising the commissioner. The commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors (Gläubigerversammlung) which has to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific majority rules. The composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the composition court. The Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act (DEBA) provides for three different types of composition agreements: (i) the ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher Nachlassvertrag) where the debtor’s business continues and the contractual terms of its payment obligations are modified (Stundungsvergleich) or creditors receive a dividend (Dividendenvergleich), (ii) the composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) and (iii) the composition agreement in bankruptcy proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im Konkurs). The moratorium could also result in a composition agreement that may comprise the formation of a new company (Auffanggesellschaft) to receive part of the business of the debtor. During a moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending debt collection proceedings are stayed; certain exceptions may apply with respect to pledged assets. In principle, interest ceases to accrue against the debtor for all unsecured claims. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. The moratorium does not per se affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication).",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

In particular, a transaction (which term includes 342 ----- the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors, which is, according to the case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, generally assumed and can only be negated in a limited number of cases: - The debtor has made a transaction considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the grant of a moratorium (while actions taken by the debtor between the grant of a moratorium until the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) can also be challenged). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted: the beneficiary must in this case prove that such transaction was at arm’s length. - Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the grant of a moratorium (while actions taken by the debtor between the grant of a moratorium until confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) can also be challenged), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any other way than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is dismissed if the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time. - Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal bankruptcy proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) or the grant of a moratorium (while actions taken by the debtor between the grant of a moratorium until the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) can also be challenged) performed by the debtor with the intention to discriminate some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence, must have been known to the debtor’s counterparty. In case the beneficiary of the relevant transaction with the debtor is a related party, including without limitation a group company, the burden of proof is shifted: the beneficiary must in this case prove that such intention was not recognizable. Following the amendments to the DEBA that came into force on January 1, 2014, with respect to transactions in favor of related parties, which may include group companies, there is now a legal presumption that the respective beneficiary was able to recognize the debtor’s intent to cause harm to other creditors. The introduction of this presumption potentially simplifies avoidance of, and could therefore have a potentially significant impact on the validity and enforceability of, any guarantee, indemnity, security interest or other benefit granted in favor of a group company, as well as any other undertaking contained in any agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver of set-off or subrogation rights or the subordination of intra-group claims, or any payment made thereunder. If any guarantee or security is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and would have a claim solely under the notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been avoided would have to be repaid. Generally, any guarantee or security governed by Swiss law is enforced in accordance with its terms under Swiss law. Unconditional and irrevocable guarantees within the meaning of art. 111 of the Swiss Code of Obligations are typically due and payable upon request of the beneficiaries or their representative. Other security (rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties to enforce the security either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency, in which case the right of objection pursuant to art. 41 of the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Collection and Insolvency (Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security agreements. 343 ----- In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may acquire any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In such a case, in order to determine the price for the acquisition of the pledged assets, the security agent may prepare a valuation of the pledged assets and based thereupon enforce the pledge in accordance with the terms of the security agreement and requirements under Swiss law. Thereafter, the security agent will settle the acquisition of the pledged assets with the pledgor. For this purpose, the net proceeds of the sale of the pledged assets will, after payment of expenses and taxes, be considered the price for the enforcement proceeds for the pledged assets, which are to be applied against the secured obligations. The security agent will credit any remaining surplus to the pledgor. In case of an assignment of claims for security purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect the assigned claims. Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale (Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without having to initiate proceedings under the DEBA. After a bankruptcy has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar “accessory” security rights (but, for the avoidance of doubt, no security created by way of full title transfer such as security assignments or transfers for security purposes (Sicherungsübereignungen) if having become effective prior to the opening of bankruptcy over the debtor) are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The beneficial holders of the Additional Notes from time to time will not be party to the security documents relating to the Collateral. In order to permit the holders of the Additional Notes from time to time to have a secured claim the security documents and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Additional Notes. The pledges governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not been tested in court under Swiss law, and there is no certainty that it will be recognized and held valid and enforceable under Swiss law.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

Therefore, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to Up- and Cross-stream Obligations of a Swiss Guarantor. Limitations on the enforcement of any guarantee and/or security interest granted by the Swiss Guarantor apply in relation to Up- and Cross-stream Obligations. The ability of the Swiss Guarantor to assume Up- and Cross-stream Obligations is restricted under Swiss law insofar as such Up- and Cross-stream Obligations (i) must be within the corporate purposes and interests of the Swiss Guarantor and (ii) must not result in a repayment of the legally protected reserves (gesetzlich geschützte Reserven) or other non-permitted distribution of assets to shareholders, board members or other persons close to the Swiss Guarantor. In light of the foregoing, it is standard market practice to limit the amount of claims under, or proceeds from enforcement that can be applied to the satisfaction of any claim secured by, any Up- and Cross-stream Obligations assumed by a Swiss Guarantor to its freely distributable equity at the time of enforcement. Freely distributable equity is equal to the maximum amount that the Swiss Guarantor can distribute to its shareholders through a dividend payment under Swiss law at such time, which is currently the total shareholder equity less the total of (i) the aggregate share capital and (ii) the statutory reserves (to the extent such reserves cannot be transferred into unrestricted, distributable reserves). Importantly, the payment of dividends from a Swiss Guarantor to its parent will reduce the freely distributable reserves of a Swiss Guarantor by the respective dividend amount and, in turn, the amount available to satisfy the obligations under its guarantee and security. In addition, following a decision by the Swiss Federal 344 ----- Supreme Court in October 2014, the freely distributable reserves of a Swiss Guarantor are reduced by the amount of any up- or cross-stream intercompany loan granted by such Swiss Guarantor to the extent such loan is determined to have not been granted at market conditions. The performance of Up- and Cross-stream Obligations may also require adherence to the formalities applicable to distributions to equity holders and, thus, further corporate action by the Swiss Guarantor and/or audited accounts confirming the amount of freely distributable equity may be required. In addition, the enforcement of the Swiss Guarantor’s Up- and Cross-stream Obligations may give rise to Swiss withholding tax (of up to 35% at current rates, subject to the applicable double-taxation treaties and/or the discharging of the liability to such tax by notification rather than payment of the tax) to the extent that the payment or enforcement of such Up- and Cross-stream Obligations have to be regarded as a deemed dividend distribution. Under Swiss law, the obligation of the Swiss Guarantor to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the secured parties for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax may not be valid and, thus, may prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary contained in the Indenture or any other Notes documentation. In addition, the obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the secured parties for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax in connection with Up- and Cross-stream Obligations granted by the Swiss Guarantor would in any case be limited by the amount of the freely distributable equity of the Swiss Guarantor. However, this restriction should not in any way limit any obligations of the Issuer or the other non-Swiss Guarantors to indemnify the secured parties in respect of the deduction of Swiss withholding tax, including, without limitation, any tax indemnity undertaking under the Indenture or any other Notes documentation. 345 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The Group has applied IFRS 15 as of 1 October 2018 using the cumulative effect method and therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 18. The Group only applied IFRS 15 retrospectively to contracts which had not yet been completed as at 1 October 2018. IFRS 15 did not have a significant impact on the Group’s accounting policies with respect to all of the Group’s revenue streams (see Note 6).

However, the Group has not early adopted them in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. The Group is currently reviewing its financial reporting for the new and amended standards which take effect on or after 1 October 2019 with a focus on the initial application of IFRS 16 Leases (“IFRS 16”). Under IFRS 16, which replaces existing leases guidance including IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations, a lessee will no longer make a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. All leases will be treated as finance leases, with the optional exception of short-term leases and low value leases. In the statement of financial position, the lessee will recognize the asset and the liability for the lease, while in the statement of profit and loss, the lessee will recognize the interest cost and the depreciation of the leased asset instead of the operating lease expenses. The Group currently expects that IFRS 16 will lead to an increase in total assets and total liabilities by approximately €150 million from the effect of recognizing existing operating leases on the balance sheet. Additionally, annual operating lease expenses of approximately €40 million are expected to be presented as depreciation expense and interest cost in the future.

The Notes comprise (i) € 765.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5[7/8]% senior secured notes, (ii) € 325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes and (iii) CHF 250.0 million € 225 million in aggregate principal amount of 5[7/8]% senior secured notes. As part of the senior debt refinancing, the senior revolving credit facility was upsized to € 150 million from € 100 million. The amounts drawn under this facility were € 106.9 million at 30 June 2019 (30 September 2018: € 56.3 million). The interest rate on this senior revolving credit facility is based on the relevant rate of the currency drawn either EURIBOR or LIBOR plus 3.5%. As at 30 June 2019 in € currency 58.5 million was drawn with an interest rate of 3.5%, and in GBP currency 30 million € 34 million was drawn with an interest rate of 4.1908%.

The PIK proceeds loan carries an interest rate of 11.875%. In December 2015, Selecta Group S.a.r.L. granted an additional PIK loan of € 5.6 million with the same conditions to the Group. From this facility € 37.4 m was repaid in cash in February 2018 and the remaining facility was renewed until 2[nd] February 2024. The interest payable is accrued.

Restated prior year interim financial statement,612.84.1,,"During the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, adjustments were made to the comparative financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2018. In the condensed cash flow statement Argenta’s repayment of the loan of € 201,254k was re-classified from investing activities to financing activities. The amounts presented in the restated cash flow statement of € 1.3 billion proceeds and € -1.1 billion repayment are gross values, whereas the net value is € 163 million. In certain cases, some of the Group’s intercompany loans qualify as a net investment in a foreign operation requiring any foreign currency gains and losses to be recognized in the other comprehensive income (previously recorded in the P&L). Accordingly, a foreign currency loss of € 0.7 million has been recorded in equity (instead of P&L), and € 0.7 million currency gain for valuation of derivative financial instrument. Furthermore, a € 0.2 million increase of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax expenses has been recorded. The depreciation for 9 month ended 30 June 2019 increased by 3.3 million due to change in the phasing.

Share based payments",612.85.1,,"In April 2018, the Group implemented a long-term incentive plan for key senior management called «Management incentive plan» (MIP). The MIP offers the opportunity to invest indirectly, through a partnership, in certain instruments of one of Selecta Group B.V.’s parents (HoldCo) which is not in the scope of these consolidated financial statements, at nominal value. The MIP is a group share-based payment plan under IFRS 2. Due to the fact that the plan does not result in an obligation for the Group to settle the plan, it is classified as an equity-settled plan. Entitled managers entered into the plan in April 2018 and the following months by signing a deed of adherence. The individual deed signing date represents the grant date. Managers subscribed to almost 100% of the total plan volume by 30 June 2019. The following investments were made by 31 March 2019: - Class A interests which provide an indirect economic interest in 597,238,605 preferred equity certificates (PECs) of HoldCo with a total nominal value of € 5,972,386. - Class B interests which provide an indirect economic interest in 28,455 ordinary shares with a nominal value of € 285 representing 0.86% of the HoldCo’s share capital and - Class C interests which provide an indirect economic interest in 223,193 additional shares with a nominal value of € 2,232 representing 6.70% of the HoldCo’s share capital The PECs underlying class A interests are interest-bearing, have a mandatory retirement date and do not entitle to voting rights in Holdco. They are generally not convertible to equity. As a result, they do not qualify as a share based payment under IFRS 2. Holders of class B and C interests are entitled to distributions based on the underlying shares including distributions in case of a sale or an initial public offering (IPO), an exit event, of the Group. The MIP provides the following vesting rules in regards to class C interests: - Graded vesting over a period of four years with 20% vesting at the grant date and 20% at each anniversary over a period of four years - Accelerated vesting in case of an exit event The class B interests vested immediately at grant date. In case of a termination of employment before an exit event, a manager would become a good or a bad leaver depending on the circumstances of termination. A good leaver’s vested class C interests would be reimbursed at fair value whereas unvested class C interests would be reimbursed at cost. If a manager became a bad leaver all class C interests would be reimbursed at cost.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)",612.120.1,,"The Group is currently reviewing its financial reporting for the new and amended standards which take effect on or after 1 October 2018 and which the Group did not voluntarily adopt early. On 1 January 2018, IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” came into effect. The Group will implement the new standard in its financial statements 2018/2019 and will apply the cumulative effect method for the transition. The new standard establishes a model to use in accounting for revenue and contains a new set of principles on when and how to recognize and measure revenue as well as new requirements related to presentation and disclosure. The core principle included in the standard is that revenue recognition is no longer based on the transfer of risks and rewards but rather on the transfer of control of goods and services to a customer. The Group is currently performing detailed analysis regarding the impact of IFRS 15 on the recognition of revenue streams in its different business lines, the effect of implementation of IFRS 16 on the Group financial statements and the impact of IFRS 9 requirements. The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. Each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that is different from that of the asset to which it belongs is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets and are amortised by the straight-line method over three to five years when the following criteria are met: - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; - there is an ability to use or sell the software product; - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Other software licences and software development costs are expensed as incurred. No intangible asset arising from research (or from research phase of an internal project) is recognised. Expenditure on research (or on the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. Each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that is different from that of the asset to which it belongs is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets and are amortised by the straight-line method over three to five years when the following criteria are met: - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; - there is an ability to use or sell the software product; - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Other software licences and software development costs are expensed as incurred. No intangible asset arising from research (or from research phase of an internal project) is recognised. Expenditure on research (or on the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that recovery will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current income tax and deferred income tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case it is also recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Where revenue is received in the form of cash, the amount recognised is the amount of cash received until the last date on which the cash was collected from the machine, plus an estimate of the sales between this date and the period end calculated based on historical trends. Where the sale of goods is invoiced to the client, the amount recognised is based either on the amounts delivered to the client or based on the consumption in the machines, depending on the specific contractual terms. Where revenue is recognised based on consumption in the machines, the amount recognised is based on the last recorded consumption from the machine plus an estimate of the sales between this date and the period end calculated based on historical trends.

Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.

The proceeds of the Notes were used to (i) fund the redemption of all of (a) the €350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Group’s 6.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 and (b) the CHF 245.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Group’s 6.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2020; (ii) repay all amounts outstanding under the existing €374.8 million senior term loan of the Group; (iii) repay all amounts outstanding under the existing revolving credit facility of the Group; (iv) in connection with the acquisition of Gruppo Argenta S.p.A. by a subsidiary of the Group, refinance certain of Argenta’s existing third-party indebtedness and shareholder loans; (v) repay certain shareholder loans of the Group, the proceeds of which will ultimately be used to repay certain interests owed to a minority investor who will exit in connection with such repayment; (vi) fund excess cash on balance sheet for general corporate purposes; and (vii) pay estimated fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the Notes. As part of the senior debt refinancing, the senior revolving credit facility was upsized to € 150 million as of 2 February 2018 from € 100 million. The amounts drawn under this facility were € 56.3 million at 30 September 2018 (30 September 2017: € 0 million). The interest rate on this senior revolving credit facility has remained based on the relevant rate of the currency drawn LIBOR plus 3.5%. In addition the Group’s parent undertaking, Selecta Group S.a.r.L. had issued in June 2014 a PIK loan for € 220 million, the proceeds of which have been loaned to the Group also in the form of a PIK loan (the “PIK proceeds loan”). The PIK proceeds loan carries an interest rate of 11.875%. In December 2015 Selecta Group S.a.r.L. granted an additional PIK loan with the same conditions to the Group of € 5.6 million. From this facility € 37.4 m was repaid in cash in February 2018 and the remaining facility was renewed until 2024. The interest payable is accrued and capitalized biannually. The senior secured notes and the revolving credit facility are secured by first ranking security interests over all the issued share capital of certain Group companies (together the “Guarantors”), certain intercompany receivables of the Company and the Guarantors, including assignment of the PIK Proceeds Loan and certain bank accounts of the Company. Under the terms of the Group’s super senior revolving credit facility, certain ratios to be tested if drawings exceeds 40% of the RCF facility.

The two main significant plans are in Switzerland and UK, which represent an net asset position of € 59.9 million, the remainder of the countries recorded a net liability position of € 17.8 million. Switzerland The pension scheme is part of the Valora Pension Fund, domiciled in Muttenz, Switzerland and is governed by the rules of the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans (BVG), which specifies the minimum benefits that are to be provided by pension plans. The scheme covers multiple employers, including Selecta, with the scheme assets allocated between Selecta and the other companies in the scheme in proportion to the mathematical reserve and savings capital as at 30 September 2018. One employee of Selecta AG in Switzerland is at the foundation board of the Valora Pension Fund to ensure representation of Selecta in the wider scheme. The designated purpose of the scheme is to protect the employees, including the employees’ dependents and survivors, of the Valora Group of companies of Switzerland and the companies with which the scheme has concluded an affiliation agreement against the economic consequences of old age, death and disability. The benefits are defined in the pension plan regulations that are far above the minimum requirements stipulated by the BVG. Retirement benefits are based on the accumulated retirement savings capital and can either be drawn as a life-long pension or as a lump sum payment. The pension is calculated upon retirement by multiplying the balance of the retirement savings capital with the applicable conversion rate. The retirement savings capital results from the yearly savings contributions by both employer and employee until retirement and carries interest thereon. The savings contributions are defined in the pension plan regulations. Minimum contributions and minimum interest are defined by the BVG and the Federal Council respectively. The scheme provides for a basic and supplementary plan. Under the basic plan, the wage portions above the entry level for admission (equal to three quarters of the maximum retirement pension benefit prescribed by law) are pensionable. The supplementary plan additionally offers coverage of wage portions that exceed the 5-fold value of the maximum retirement pension benefit by more than CHF 5,000. The scheme is subdivided into a risk pre-insurance and a primary insurance. The risk pre-insurance coverage is a pure risk insurance that covers the risks of death and disability up to the age of 25. The primary insurance begins at age 25 and is comprised of a savings facility run by the scheme and insurance covering the death and disability risks. The scheme participates in compulsory coverage and is entered in the register for occupational pension providers as provided for by art. 48 of the Federal Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans Act (BVG/LPP). At minimum it provides for the benefits pursuant to BVG/LPP. The scheme is under the regulatory supervision of the Canton of Basel Land. UK The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is identified as the Selecta (UK) Pension Plan (the “Plan”, formerly known as the Autobar Group Retirement Benefits Plan). The scheme is managed by an independent trustee (ITS) and the ultimate authority is with the UK Pension Regulator F-64 ----- The Group offers defined benefit plans in Switzerland, Germany and Spain as well as retirement indemnity plans in France. Approximately 96% of the defined benefit obligation and 100% of the plan assets relate to the Group’s pension scheme in Switzerland.

Post-employment benefits (Continued)",612.269.1,,"in case of disputes between the trustee and the Group. The Group accounted for this plan as defined benefit plan because it is exposed to risks as mentioned in the paragraph ‘sensitivity analysis’. With effect from October 2004 the Plan was closed to new members and on 31 March 2015 future accrual stopped. Prior to that, pension accrual for active members was a proportion of the salary at retirement (or earlier date of leaving) based on length of Plan membership. Pensions are payable for life from retirement with the option to convert some pension to a cash lump sum at the point of retirement. A reduced pension is payable to any surviving spouse on death of the member. Pensions in payment increase each year at various rates depending on the period when accrued. Pensions for those members not yet retired are increased in line with the Consumer Prices Index subject to a cap of 5% a year (applied over the whole period). Every sensitivity analysis considers the change of one assumption, while all other assumptions remain the same. This approach shows the isolating effect if an individual assumption is changed, but does not consider that some assumption3s are mutually dependent.

The scheme provides for a basic and supplementary plan. Under the basic plan, the wage portions above the entry level for admission (equal to three quarters of the maximum retirement pension benefit prescribed by law) are pensionable. The supplementary plan additionally offers coverage of wage portions that exceed the 5-fold value of the maximum retirement pension benefit by more than CHF 5,000. The scheme is subdivided into a risk pre-insurance and a primary insurance. The risk pre-insurance coverage is a pure risk insurance that covers the risks of death and disability up to the age of 25. The primary insurance begins at age 25 and is comprised of a savings facility run by the scheme and insurance covering the death and disability risks. The scheme participates in compulsory coverage and is entered in the register for occupational pension providers as provided for by art. 48 of the Federal Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans Act (BVG/LPP). At minimum it provides for the benefits pursuant to BVG/LPP. The scheme is under the regulatory supervision of the Canton of Basel Land.

This amendment of future increases to these benefits has resulted in a decrease in the Plan’s liabilities of €12.1 million as at 30 September 2018 and has been recognised as a negative past service cost in the year ended 30 September 2018. Past service credit / (cost) and gains / (losses) relates to a Swiss plan amendment of the benefits payable under the Group’s pension in scheme in Switzerland. In March 2018 the Valora pension scheme reduced the conversion rate for calculating the retirement pension, resulting in a reduction of the future pensions to be paid and hence the defined benefit obligation of the scheme. This has resulted in a decrease in the Plan’s liabilities of €2 million as at 30 September 2018 and has been recognised as a negative past service cost in the year ended 30 September 2018. As communicated in March 2018 by the pension fund Valora, conversion rates will decrease to 6.2% to 6.0% (for men aged 65 and women aged 64), effective on 1 January 2019. As regards to prior year credit as communicated in June 2017 by the pension fund Valora, conversion rates decreased to 6.2% for men and 6.4% for women, effective on 1 January 2018, resulting in a reduction of the future pensions to be paid and hence the defined benefit obligation of the scheme.

Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. This risk is managed by limiting exposures in instruments that may be affected by liquidity problems and by actively matching the funding horizon of debt with incoming cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring adequate reserves are available, and through its banking facilities, in particular the Group’s revolving credit facilities. In addition, the Group continuously monitors cash flows to ensure that adequate funds exist to settle its liabilities.

In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency without the approval of the CFO.

As most of the contracts for purchase of raw material are in functional currency, the Group is no longer applying USD forward contracts. Per 30 September 2018 the Group is committed to remaining USD forward contracts of which the USD exposure is low and will expire in December 2018. At 30 September 2017 the derivative financial instruments had a positive fair value of net € 1.8 million, with the below conditions: The Group holds certain cross currency swaps in order to hedge against the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s interest payments and borrowings. Part of the cross currency swaps entered into in June 2014 have been designated as cash flow hedges to the extent that they represent an effective accounting hedge. These hedging instruments have been terminated in May 2016 and therefore hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively. The remaining hedge reserve of the terminated hedging instruments have been fully reclassified from equity to profit and loss when the original exchange rate fluctuations on the Group’s interest payments and borrowings impact profit or loss. No hedge accounting is applied to the new cross currency swaps the Group entered into in the renewal transactions in the reporting period. At 30 September 2017 the derivative financial instruments had a positive fair value of net € 1.8 million, at prior year end had a negative fair value of net € 5.5 million. The fair value movement was recognized in the P&L.

None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. New information has been obtained within one year of the date of acquisition about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition. According to IFRS 3, accounting for the acquisition has been revised, as described in the table below. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3—Business Combinations, to incorporate the acquired entity in the Group financial statements. Argenta’s results after 2 February 2018 are included in the Group’s financial results, with a contribution to revenue € 137.2 million and net profit of € 1.8 million. The Group’s consolidated balance sheet incorporates the acquired assets and liabilities of Argenta measured at fair values as part of the acquisition’s preliminary purchase price allocation. The acquisition of Argenta was the result of: - The buying out of a majority shareholder Motion Equity Partners and a minority shareholder Temma, amounting to a cash consideration of € 22.7 million - The contribution of Argenta by KKR in exchange for a loan payable to Selecta Group Midco S.a.r.l (the shareholder of Selecta Group B.V), which was offset by the issuance of shares by Selecta Group BV to Selecta MidCo, translating into a non-cash consideration of € 200.4 million. Argenta’s senior debt in value of € 201.2 million was refinanced as part of the Selecta Group debt refinancing. A summary of the acquisition is presented below, and includes the provisional results of the purchase price allocation to the acquired intangible and tangible assets, as well as to the acquired liabilities: Measurement of fair values: The process of identification and measurement of intangible assets was conducted internally leading to the provisional recognition of Argenta’s customer contracts values, and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities, in Selecta Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2018. The customer contracts were assessed with the multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. The goodwill is attributable mainly to the market entry into Italy and with that expanding the Groups European Footprint. Argenta is widely recognized as a benchmark for operational excellence and a leader in coffee services and vending innovations including micro markets, cashless payment technologies and healthy on-the-go food retail offerings. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. If new information obtained within one year of the date of acquisition about facts and circumstances that existed at the date of acquisition justifies adjustments to the acquisition values presented above, then the accounting for the acquisition will be revised. Express Vending is involved in micro market design in the UK. Its Express HUB, with its open plan refreshment area, extensive product range and self-scan kiosks, will enable the Group to complement Selecta’s Foodie’s micro market offering. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method according to IFRS 3—Business Combinations, to incorporate the acquired entity in the Group financial statements. The Express Vending results were incorporated in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for days between the acquisition date, and the closing date of the Group’s consolidated financial statements, on 30 September 2018. Express Vending contributed € 7.2 million revenue and a net profit for the period of € 0.8 million to the Group’s result for the year ended 30 September 2018. The Group’s consolidated balance sheet incorporates the acquired assets and liabilities of Express Vending measured at fair value, which amounts are preliminary and all the consideration in excess of net assets was recorded as a preliminary goodwill. In the consideration transferred of € 69.8 million, € 9.2 million relates to an amount held on an escrow account until finalisation of the completion accounts by January 2019 and the calculation of the final purchase price. The consideration for Express vending is structured as follows: With regards to the Pelican Rouge Group acquisition completed during the financial year of 30 September 2017, if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2016, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been € 1.3 billion, and consolidated loss for the year would have been € 178 million. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2016. determined provisionally, that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2016.

Scenario 2: Graded vesting (with 20% vesting at the grant date and at each anniversary additional 20%) over the period of four years for managers who become good leavers.

Under the terms of the Group’s super senior revolving credit facility, a minimum net leverage ratio must be met before further drawings may be made under the facility.

Post-employment benefits (Continued)",612.598.1,,"Selecta Switzerland The pension scheme is part of the Valora Pension Fund, domiciled in Muttenz, Switzerland and is governed by the rules of the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans (BVG), which specifies the minimum benefits that are to be provided by pension plans. The scheme covers multiple employers, including Selecta, with the scheme assets allocated between Selecta and the other companies in the scheme in proportion to the mathematical reserve and savings capital as at 30 September 2017. One employee of Selecta AG in Switzerland sits on the foundation board of the Valora Pension Fund to ensure representation of Selecta in the wider scheme. The designated purpose of the scheme is to protect the employees, including the employees’ dependents and survivors, of the Valora Group of companies of Switzerland and the companies with which the scheme has concluded an affiliation agreement against the economic consequences of old age, death and disability. The benefits are defined in the pension plan regulations that are far above the minimum requirements stipulated by the BVG. Retirement benefits are based on the accumulated retirement savings capital and can either be drawn as a life-long pension or as a lump sum payment. The pension is upon retirement calculated by multiplying the balance of the retirement savings capital with the applicable conversion rate. The retirement savings capital results from the yearly savings contributions by both employer and employee until retirement and carries interest thereon. The savings contributions are defined in the pension plan regulations. Minimum contributions and minimum interest are defined by the BVG and the Federal Council respectively. The scheme provides for a basic and supplementary plan. Under the basic plan, the wage portions above the entry level for admission (equal to three quarters of the maximum retirement pension benefit prescribed by law) are pensionable. The supplementary plan additionally offers coverage of wage portions that exceed the 5-fold value of the maximum retirement pension benefit by more than CHF 5’000. The scheme is subdivided into a risk pre-insurance and a primary insurance. The risk pre-insurance coverage is a pure risk insurance that covers the risks of death and disability up to the age of 25. The primary insurance begins at age 25 and is comprised of a savings facility run by the scheme and insurance covering the death and disability risks. The scheme participates in compulsory coverage and is entered in the register for occupational pension providers as provided for by art. 48 of the Federal Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans Act (BVG/LPP). At minimum it provides for the benefits pursuant to BVG/LPP. The scheme is under the regulatory supervision of the Canton of Basel Land. UK Pelican Rouge The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, which is identified as the Pelican Rouge Retirement Benefits Plan (the “Plan”, formerly known as the Autobar Group Retirement Benefits Plan). The scheme is managed by an independent trustee (ITS) and the ultimate authority is with the UK Pension Regulator in case of disputes between the trustee and the company. The company accounted for this plan as defined benefit plan because it is exposed to risks as mentioned in the paragraph ‘sensitivity analysis’. With effect from October 2004 the Plan was closed to new members and on 31 March 2015 future accrual stopped.. This resulted in a curtailment in the year to 31 March 2015. Prior to that, pension accrual for active members was a proportion of the salary at retirement (or earlier date of leaving) based on length of Plan membership. Pensions are payable for life from retirement with the option to convert some pension to a cash lump sum at the point of retirement. A reduced pension is payable to any surviving spouse on death of the member. Pensions in payment increase each year at various rates depending on the period when accrued. Pensions for those members not yet retired are increased in line with the Consumer Prices Index subject to a cap of 5% a year (applied over the whole period). As for the other plans in the group the pension valuation has been updated by an independent qualified actuary to 30 September 2017 for IFRS purposes (IAS 19). F-128 ----- A number of subsidiaries in the United Kingdom are participating employers in the Plan. Individual companies are unable to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities as each employer is exposed to the actuarial risks associated with current and former employees of other entities that have participated in the Plan over its lifetime. In addition to the IFRS requirements, the UK entity is required to satisfy local regulations in the United Kingdom. The calculation of the assets and liabilities according to local regulations is different than under IFRS. The most recent calculation according to local regulation was carried out with a reference date of 30 June 2015. As a result of the calculation the Group agreed with the Trustees of the Plan that annual deficit funding payments of GBP 1,900 thousands have to be made until 20 June 2020. The funding is recognised at the moment of payment. If the Plan’s assets are insufficient to cover the benefits promised to members the UK company might need to increase its contributions. The assets of the Plan are held in a trust and are separated from those of the UK company.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582

The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring adequate reserves are available, and through its banking facilities, in particular the Group’s revolving credit facilities. In addition, the Group continuously monitors cash flows to ensure that adequate funds exist to settle its liabilities. The Group has several benchmarks and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for using derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency without the approval of the CFO. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency exposures without the approval of the CFO.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. These cash-generating units are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that a unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Financial risk management (Continued)",612.957.1,,"Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and ongoing credit evaluation in all the subsidiaries. Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables, and there were no counterparties where credit risk exceeded 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. In addition, due to the nature of the Group’s operations, a significant portion of its revenues are received in cash. For details on how the Group manages its credit risk arising from trade receivables see note 20. The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents (€ 66.8m, 2015 € 36.2m) as these are spread over several institutions in different geographic areas. Settlement risk results from the fact that the Group may not receive financial instruments from its counterparties at the expected time. This risk is managed by monitoring counterparty activity and settlement limits. The interest rate on the Group’s secured loan notes amounts to 6.5%, on the loans due to parent undertakings to 11.875%, and on the Group’s revolving credit facility to LIBOR plus 3.5%. The remaining contractual maturity in respect of the Group’s borrowings is disclosed in Note 31.4. The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments are as follows: Certain of the holding companies based in Switzerland, and therefore with Swiss Francs as their functional currency, have loan receivables and payables, both with external parties and with other Group companies, denominated in currencies other than their functional currency.

Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. This risk is managed by limiting exposures in instruments that may be affected by liquidity problems and by actively matching the funding horizon of debt with incoming cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring adequate reserves are available, and through its banking facilities, in particular the Group’s revolving credit facilities. In addition, the Group continuously monitors cash flows to ensure that adequate funds exist to settle its liabilities. The Group has several benchmarks and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for using derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local currency without the approval of the CFO. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency exposures without the approval of the CFO. Wherever possible, the Group requires that subsidiaries repatriate all their excess cash and bank balances to Group finance companies to allow the Group to ensure that adequate funds are made available across the Group as necessary.",N/A,as_expected,2019,582
