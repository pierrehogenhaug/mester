##### g350,000,000 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 CHF 245,000,000 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020

Selecta Group B.V., incorporated as a private limited liability company under the laws of the Netherlands (the ‘‘Issuer’’) is offering (the ‘‘Offering’’)
e350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the ‘‘Euro Notes’’) and CHF 245,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of its 6.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the ‘‘CHF Notes’’ and, together with the Euro Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’). Interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually in arrear on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2014. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2020.

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes on or after December 15, 2016, at the redemption prices set out in this offering memorandum. Prior to
December 15, 2016, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus the applicable ‘‘make whole’’ premium, as described in this offering memorandum. In
addition, (i) prior to December 15, 2016, the Issuer may also redeem at its option up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes with
the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum. Upon the occurrence of certain events
constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. A change of control will not be deemed to have occurred on one
occasion if a certain consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded immediately prior to and after giving pro forma effect to such event, as described in this
offering memorandum. Additionally, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes in the event of certain developments affecting taxation.

The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior obligations and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future senior indebtedness that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). The Notes will be
guaranteed (the ‘‘Notes Guarantees’’) on a senior basis by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer (the ‘‘Guarantors’’). The Notes Guarantees
will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and may be released under certain circumstances.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking security interests over all the issued share capital of the Guarantors, certain receivables
and intercompany receivables of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including assignment of the Proceeds Loan (as defined herein) and certain bank accounts of
the Issuer (the ‘‘Collateral’’). See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Collateral.’’ The Collateral will be subject to contractual and legal limitations and may be
released under certain circumstances. The Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees also secures on a ‘‘super senior’’ basis our obligations
under the Revolving Credit Facility and may also secure additional indebtedness in the future. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Revolving Credit Facility.’’ Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), proceeds of any enforcement of the security interests in the_
security will be applied to pay the Revolving Credit Facility in priority to the Notes. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.’’_

This offering memorandum includes information on the terms of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, including redemption and repurchase prices,
guarantees, covenants, events of default and offering and transfer restrictions.

This offering memorandum constitutes a prospectus for purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg act dated July 10, 2005 on prospectuses for securities, as
amended, and includes information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer restrictions. Application
has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes for trading on the Euro MTF market of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Euro MTF’’), which is not a regulated market within the meaning of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial

NV (‘‘Euroclear’’) or Clearstream Banking, soci´et´e anonyme (‘‘Clearstream Banking’’ or ‘‘Clearstream’’) on or about June 20, 2014 (the ‘‘Issue Date’’). See
‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.’’

**Price for the Euro Notes: 100.000% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date**

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

We accept responsibility for the information contained in this offering memorandum and, to the best of
our knowledge, the information is true and accurate in all material respects and contains no omission
likely to affect the import of such information. As used in this offering memorandum, unless the context
otherwise requires, references to the ‘‘Issuer’’ are to Selecta Group B.V. and references to ‘‘we’’, ‘‘us’’,
‘‘our’’ and the ‘‘Group’’ are to Selecta Group B.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

You should rely only on the information contained in this offering memorandum. We have not, and
BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs International and KKR Capital Markets Limited (the ‘‘Initial Purchasers’’)
have not, authorized anyone to provide you with information that is different from the information
contained herein. We are not, and the Initial Purchasers are not, making an offer of these securities in any
jurisdiction where such offer is not permitted.

The Initial Purchasers are not responsible for, and are not making any representation or warranty to you
concerning, our future performance or the accuracy or completeness of this offering memorandum. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, neither the Initial Purchasers nor the trustee or any agent accepts any
responsibility for the contents of this offering memorandum or for any other statement made or
purported to be made by the Issuer in connection with the issuance and Offering. The Initial Purchasers,
the trustee and any agent accordingly disclaim all and any liability whether arising in tort or contract or
otherwise which they might otherwise have in respect of this offering memorandum or any such
statement. The Initial Purchasers do not undertake to review the financial condition or affairs of the Issuer
or any Guarantor during the life of the Notes or to advise any investor or potential investor in the Notes of
any information coming to the attention of any Initial Purchaser. The Issuer, and not the Initial Purchasers,
have ultimate authority over the statements contained in this offering memorandum, including the
content of those statements and whether and how to communicate them.

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in
which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such
offer or solicitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction
where action would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, and this offering memorandum may not be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in
accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws
applicable in any jurisdiction in which you buy, offer or sell the Notes or possess or distribute this offering
memorandum and you must obtain all applicable consents and approvals; neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers shall have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal requirements. See ‘‘Offering and
_Transfer Restrictions.’’_

In making an investment decision regarding the Notes offered hereby, you must rely on your own
examination of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the terms of this Offering, including the merits and
risks involved. You should rely only on the information contained in this offering memorandum. We have
not, and the Initial Purchasers have not, authorized any other person to provide you with different
information. If anyone provides you with different or inconsistent information, you should not rely on it.
This offering memorandum is based on information provided by us and other sources believed by us to
be reliable. You should assume that the information appearing in this offering memorandum is accurate
as of the date on the front cover of this offering memorandum only. Our business, financial condition,
results of operations and the information set forth in this offering memorandum may have changed since
that date.

You should not consider any information in this offering memorandum to be investment, legal or tax
advice. You should consult your own counsel, accountant and other advisors for legal, tax, business,
financial and related advice regarding purchasing the Notes. We are not, and the Initial Purchasers are
not, making any representation to any offeree or purchaser of the Notes regarding the legality of an
investment in the Notes by such offeree or purchaser under appropriate investment or similar laws. This
offering memorandum is to be used only for the purposes for which it has been published. Prospective
purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the consequences of
purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes, including, without limitation, the application of U.S.
federal tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any consequences to them under the laws of any
other taxing jurisdiction, and the consequences of purchasing the Notes at a price other than the initial
issue price. See ‘‘Tax Considerations.’’

We obtained the market data used in this offering memorandum from internal surveys, industry sources
and currently available public information. Although we believe that our sources are reliable, you should
keep in mind that we have not independently verified information we have obtained from industry and
governmental sources and that information from our internal surveys has not been verified by any
independent sources. See ‘‘Industry Overview.’’

Information contained on any website named in this offering memorandum, including our own website,
is not incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum and is not part of this offering
memorandum.

We may withdraw this Offering at any time, and we and the Initial Purchasers reserve the right to reject
any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part and to sell to any prospective investor less than the full
amount of the Notes sought by such investor. One or more of the Initial Purchasers or affiliates thereof
may acquire a portion of the Notes for their own accounts.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States and may not be offered or sold within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the
U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Regulation S’’)) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees are being offered and sold outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S and within the United States to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ (‘‘QIBs’’) in reliance on
Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’). Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that the
sellers of the Notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S.
Securities Act provided by Rule 144A. The Notes and the Notes Guarantees are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the U.S.
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws pursuant to registration thereunder or exemption
therefrom. You should be aware that you may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for
an indefinite period of time. For a description of these and certain other restrictions on offers, sales and
transfers of the Notes and the distribution of this offering memorandum, see ‘‘Offering and Transfer
_Restrictions.’’_

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the ‘‘SEC’’), any state securities commission in the United States or any other
U.S. regulatory authority, nor have any of the foregoing authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits
of the Offering of the Notes or the accuracy or adequacy of this offering memorandum. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

The information contained under the heading ‘‘Exchange Rate Information’’ includes extracts from
information and data publicly released by official and other sources. While we accept responsibility for
accurately summarizing the information concerning exchange rate information, we accept no further
responsibility in respect of such information.

The information set out in any sections of this offering memorandum describing clearing and settlement
arrangements, including ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’, is subject to
any change in or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream
currently in effect. While we accept responsibility for accurately summarizing the information concerning
Euroclear and Clearstream, we accept no further responsibility in respect of such information.

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes may be restricted by
law in certain jurisdictions. You must inform yourself about, and observe, any such restrictions. See
‘‘Notice to New Hampshire Residents’’, ‘‘Notice to Certain European Investors’’, ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’
and ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions’’ elsewhere in this offering memorandum. You must comply with
all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which you purchase, offer or sell the
Notes or possess or distribute this offering memorandum and must obtain any consent, approval or
permission required for your purchase, offer or sale of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force
in any jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchases, offers or sales. We are
not, and the Initial Purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes or a solicitation of an offer to buy
any of the Notes to any person in any jurisdiction except where such an offer or solicitation is permitted.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be six business days (as such term

iii

is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the ‘‘U.S. Exchange
**Act’’)) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T + 6’’)**
(London business days). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in three business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this offering
memorandum or the following business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at
the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such
trades should consult their own advisors.

**In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Goldman Sachs International (the ‘‘Stabilizing**
**Manager’’) (or any person acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) may over-allot Notes or**
**effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than**
**that which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilizing Manager**
**(or any person acting on behalf of the Stabilizing Manager) will undertake stabilizing action. Any**
**stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the**
**terms of the offer of the Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no**
**later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the**
**allotment of the Notes.**

**REPRESENTATION INCONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH.**

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**_European Economic Area._** This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers
of the Notes will be made pursuant to an exemption under Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive (as
defined below) as implemented in member states of the European Economic Area (the ‘‘EEA’’), from the
requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of the Notes. Accordingly, any person making or
intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should only do so in circumstances in which no
obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor
the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes
through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial Purchasers, which constitute the
final placement of the Notes contemplated in this offering memorandum.

In relation to each member state of the EEA that has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a
‘‘Relevant Member State’’), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is
implemented in that Relevant Member State, the offer is not being made and will not be made to the
public of any Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this offering memorandum to
the public in that Relevant Member State, other than:

(i) to any legal entity that is a ‘‘qualified investor’’ as defined in the Prospectus Directive;

(ii) to fewer than 100 or, if the Relevant Member State has implemented the relevant provision of
the 2010 PD Amending Directive, 150, natural or legal persons (other than ‘‘qualified investors’’
as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive, subject to
obtaining the prior consent of the relevant Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers nominated by
us for any such offer; or

iv


-----

(iii) in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive; provided that
no such offer of the Notes shall require the publication by us or any Initial Purchaser of a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an ‘‘offer of Notes to the public’’ in relation to the Notes
in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to
purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Relevant Member State by any
measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Relevant Member State and the expression
‘‘Prospectus Directive’’ means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including Directive
2010/73/EU (the ‘‘2010 PD Amending Directive’’), to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member
State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State or a
supplement to a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive other than in reliance on
Article 3(2)(b).

Each subscriber for or purchaser of the Notes in the offering located within a member state of the EEA
will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that it is a ‘‘qualified investor’’ within the
meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive. We, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates and
others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the foregoing representation, acknowledgement and
agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a person who is not a ‘‘qualified investor’’ and who has notified
the Initial Purchasers of such fact in writing may, with the consent of the Initial Purchasers, be permitted
to subscribe for or purchase the Notes in the Offering.

**_France._** This offering memorandum has not been prepared in the context of a public offering in France
within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Code Mon´etaire et Financier and Title I of Book II of
the R`eglement G´en´eral of the Autorit´e des march´es financiers (the French financial markets authority, or
‘‘AMF’’) and therefore has not been submitted for clearance to the AMF. Consequently, the Notes have
not been and will not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the public in France, and neither this
offering memorandum nor any other offering material relating to the Notes has been or will be distributed
or caused to be distributed to the public in France. Such offers, sales and distribution of the Notes have
been and will only be made in France to (a) providers of investment services relating to portfolio
management for the account of third parties (personnes fournissant le service d’investissement de
_gestion de portefeuille pour compte de tiers), and/or (b) qualified investors (investisseurs qualifi´es), other_
than individuals, acting for their own account, as defined in, and in accordance with, Articles L. 411-1,
L. 411-2 and D. 411-1 of the French Code of Mon´etaire et Financier.

**_The Netherlands._** The Notes which are the subject of this offering memorandum have not been and
shall not be offered, sold, transferred or delivered in the Netherlands other than to legal entities which are
qualified investors (within the meaning of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel
_toezicht)._

**_Grand Duchy of Luxembourg._** This offering memorandum has not been approved by and will not be
submitted for approval to the _Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the Luxembourg_
Financial Services Supervisory Authority, or ‘‘CSSF’’) or a competent authority of another EU Member
State for notification to the CSSF, for purposes of a public offering or sale in the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg (‘‘Luxembourg’’). Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in
Luxembourg, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other circular,
prospectus, form of application, advertisement or other material may be distributed, or otherwise made
available in or from, or published in, Luxembourg, except for the sole purpose of the admission of the
Notes to trading on the Euro MTF and listing on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
except in circumstances which do not constitute a public offer of securities to the public requiring the
publication of a prospectus in accordance with the Luxembourg Act of July 10, 2005 on prospectuses for
securities, as amended (the ‘‘Luxembourg Prospectus Law’’) and implementing the Prospectus
Directive. Consequently, this offering memorandum and any other offering circular, prospectus, form of
application, advertisement or other material may only be distributed to (a) Luxembourg qualified
investors as defined in the Luxembourg Prospectus Law, (b) no more than 149 prospective investors,
which are not qualified investors and/or (c) in any other circumstance contemplated by the Luxembourg
Prospectus Law.

**_Sweden._** This offering memorandum is not a prospectus and has not been prepared in accordance
with the prospectus requirements provided for in the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act (lagen
_(1991:980) om handel med finansiella instrument) nor any other Swedish enactment. Neither the_
Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen) nor any other Swedish public body has
examined, approved or registered this offering memorandum or will examine, approve or register this
offering memorandum. Accordingly, this offering memorandum may not be made available, nor may the

deemed not to be an offer to the public under the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Certain statements in this offering memorandum are not historical facts and are ‘‘forward-looking’’ within
the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act and Section 21E of the U.S. Exchange Act. This
document contains certain forward-looking statements in various sections, including, without limitation,
under the headings ‘‘Risk Factors’’, ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations’’, ‘‘Industry Overview’’ and ‘‘Our Business’’, and in other sections where this_
offering memorandum includes statements about our intentions, beliefs or current expectations
regarding our future financial results, plans, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategy and profitability, as well
as the general economic conditions of the industry and countries in which we operate. Forward-looking
statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future
sales or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions,
our competitive strengths and weaknesses, our business strategy and the trends we anticipate in the
industries and the economic, political and legal environment in which we operate and other information
that is not historical information.

Words such as ‘‘believe’’, ‘‘anticipate’’, ‘‘estimate’’, ‘‘expect’’, ‘‘intend’’, ‘‘predict’’, ‘‘project’’, ‘‘could’’,
‘‘may’’, ‘‘will’’, ‘‘plan’’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are
not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.

By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks, assumptions and uncertainties,
both general and specific, and risks exist that the predictions, forecasts, projections and other forwardlooking statements will not be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements or projections. These risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors include, among
other things, those listed under ‘‘Risk Factors’’, as well as those included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements and projections are based on
reasonable assumptions at the time they were made, you should be aware that a number of important
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the plans, objectives, expectations, estimates
and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors include:

- changes in general economic conditions, consumer confidence and consumer spending;

- credit and liquidity disruptions in the global financial system;

- risks related to changing consumer preferences and technological innovations;

- changes in governmental regulation and legislation;

- payment of increased vending rents;

- competition in our industry;

- failure of manufacturers for the production of vending machines;

- disruptions in supply and logistics chain;

- fluctuations in costs related to fuel, coffee and commodity prices;

- the seasonality of our business;

- impact of seasonal variation and abnormal weather;

- loss of major clients and/or inability to establish new client relationships;

- failure of key information technology and maintenance systems or processes;

- tax audits and investigations;

- adequacy of insurance coverage;

- exposure to credit risk of clients;

- inability to retain key employees;

- labor disruptions and increases in labor and employment costs;

- claims of anti-competitive practices;

- risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings;

- risks related to our capital structure;

vii


-----

- risks related to our indebtedness;

- risks related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral; and

- other factors discussed in this offering memorandum.

This list of important factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and
other uncertainties and events, especially in light of the regulatory, political, economic, social and legal
environments in which we operate. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which
they are made. Accordingly, we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We do not make any representation, warranty
or prediction that the results anticipated by such forward-looking statements will be achieved, and such
forward-looking statements represent, in each case, only one of many possible scenarios and should
not be viewed as the most likely or standard scenario.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We operate in a segment of the vending machine industry for which there is limited industry and market
information. Market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used, and statements
regarding our position in the industry made, in this offering memorandum were derived based upon
market research, government and other publicly available information, reports prepared by consultants
and independent industry publications. These include information published by the European Vending
Association. The information in this offering memorandum that has been sourced from third parties has
been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from the information
published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced
information inaccurate or misleading. While we believe the statements included in such third-party
publications to be reliable, they have not been independently verified, and neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of such
information set forth in this offering memorandum. Additionally, industry publications and such reports
generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be
reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some
instances state that they do not assume liability for such information. Neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers can therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we have
not independently verified such information.

In addition, certain information in this offering memorandum regarding our segment of the vending
machine industry and our market position is not based on published statistical data or information
obtained from independent third parties. Such information and statements reflect our estimates based
upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and associations and other contacts
within the industry in which we compete, internal surveys and assumptions we deem reasonable, as well
as information published by our competitors. To the extent that information in this offering memorandum
is identified as being our belief, that information is based on the following: (i) in respect of industry
trends, our senior management’s general business experience, as well as their experience in our
industry and the markets in which we operate; and (ii) in respect of the performance of our operations,
our internal analysis of our audited and unaudited financial and other information. As some of the
foregoing information was compiled or provided by our management or advisors and is not publicly
available, such information accordingly may not be considered to be as independent as that provided by
other third party sources.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

**Financial Information**

The consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IFRS’’) and the interim consolidated financial statements included in this
offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard
(‘‘IAS’’) 34, Interim Financial Reporting.

In this offering memorandum, financial information has been derived from:

- the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as at and for the six-month period ended
March 31, 2014 with comparable information for the six-month period ended March 31, 2013, and the
notes thereto (the ‘‘Interim Consolidated Financial Statements’’);

- the audited consolidated financial statements of Selecta Group B.V. as at and for the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and the notes thereto (the ‘‘Consolidated Financial
**Statements’’); and**

- Selecta Group B.V.’s internal accounting system.

In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have restated the financial information relating to the year
2011 to reflect the provision for long-term service awards in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits.

In our Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, we have adopted IAS 19 Revised (IAS 19R) for our
fiscal year beginning October 1, 2013, which changed how we account for post-retirement employee
benefits. The impact has been applied retrospectively to our interim financial statements for the six
months ended March 31, 2013. The impact has not been applied retrospectively to our Consolidated
Financial Statements as at and for the years ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Please refer to
notes 2.3 and 2.6 in our Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description and the
quantitative impact of the adoption of IAS 19R.

The Consolidated Financial Statements and the auditor’s report of KPMG AG thereon as well as the
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are included in this offering memorandum beginning on
page F-1.

Prior to the Offering, we managed our operations under one reporting segment under IFRS as disclosed
in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have elected to present in this offering memorandum our
revenue and certain non-IFRS financial measures by region for our historical financial periods, and the
presentation of such additional financial information in this offering memorandum is based on our
internal financial reporting. These regions consist of the following:

- Central includes our operating entities in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Spain,
Switzerland and Slovakia;

- North includes our operating entities in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, the
Netherlands, Norway and Sweden;

- France includes our operating entities in France;

- United Kingdom includes our operating entities in the United Kingdom and Ireland; and

- Headquarters includes all corporate center functions in Switzerland.

The unaudited consolidated financial information presented for the twelve months ended March 31,
2014 have been derived by subtracting from the financial information from the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Selecta Group B.V. for the year ended September 30, 2013, the comparative financial
information from the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended March 31,
2013, and adding the financial information from the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the six
months ended March 31, 2014. The unaudited consolidated financial information presented for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2014 have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not
necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at
any future date.

Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the
differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and other systems of generally accepted accounting

xii


-----

principles and how those differences might affect the financial information included in this offering
memorandum; and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, IFRS may have on our
results of operations or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods.

In addition, we have included certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios in this offering
memorandum. See ‘‘—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.’’ The non-IFRS measures we present may also be
defined differently than the corresponding terms under the Indenture (as defined herein).

The unaudited _pro forma financial information contained in this offering memorandum has not been_
prepared on the basis of IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been
derived by applying pro forma adjustments to our historical consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum and gives effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds
therefrom and from existing cash as described in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’, as if they had occurred on April 1,
2013 for the pro forma cash interest expense information and on March 31, 2014 for the pro forma net
debt information. The unaudited _pro forma adjustments and the unaudited_ _pro forma financial_
information set forth in this offering memorandum are based on available information and certain
assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ from actual amounts. The
unaudited pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only and does not purport to
present what our results would actually have been had these transactions occurred on the dates
presented or to project our results of operations or financial position for any future period or our financial
condition at any future date.

The financial information marked as ‘‘unaudited’’ in tables in this offering memorandum is not extracted
from the Consolidated Financial Statements and was either extracted from the Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements or Selecta Group B.V.’s internal accounting system or is based on calculations of
figures from these sources.

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or thousands and percentages, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the
totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and
other data set forth in ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations’’ are calculated using the numerical data in the consolidated financial statements of Selecta_
Group B.V. or the tabular presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this offering
memorandum, as applicable, and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of
the SEC which would apply if the Notes and Notes Guarantees were being registered with the SEC.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This offering memorandum contains references to certain non-IFRS measures and related ratios,
including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, third party debt, net
debt, capital expenditures, free cash flow, pro forma net debt and pro forma interest expense.

We define ‘‘EBITDA’’ as profit before interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment
expense. We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as profit before interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization
and impairment expense and one-off items.

We define ‘‘EBITDA margin’’ as EBITDA divided by revenue. We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA margin’’ as
Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

We define ‘‘net capital expenditure’’ as the sum of additions to vending equipment, vehicles, freehold
land and buildings, other equipment and intangible assets less total disposals and profits on disposals
of property, plant and equipment.

We define ‘‘free cash flow’’ as net cash generated from operating activities less net cash used in
investing activities.

We define ‘‘net debt’’ as financial debt comprising our Existing Senior Credit Facility (as defined herein)
and Existing Mezzanine Facility (as defined herein) and finance leases less cash and cash equivalents at
end of period.

xiii


-----

We define ‘‘overhead costs’’ as the sum of total employee benefits expense, total depreciation,
amortization and impairment expense and certain other operating expenses (maintenance,
administration expenses, travel and representation, vending rent and other rent).

We define ‘‘pro forma net debt’’ as net debt adjusted to give effect to the Offering and the entering into
the Revolving Credit Facility and use of proceeds therefrom and from existing cash as set forth in ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds’’ as if they had occurred on March 31, 2014._

We define ‘‘pro forma cash interest expense’’ as cash interest expense for the period, as adjusted to
give effect to the Offering and the entering into the Revolving Credit Facility and the PIK Proceeds Loan
and the use of proceeds therefrom and from existing cash as set forth in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if they had
occurred on April 1, 2013, using the interest rate for the Notes.

The non-IFRS measures and related ratios contained in this offering memorandum should not be
considered in isolation and are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and
should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, profit or loss for the period or any other
performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating,
investing or financing activities or any other measure of our liquidity derived in accordance with IFRS.
Non-IFRS measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash
requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations. In addition, certain non-IFRS
measures, as we define them, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other
companies. We believe that EBITDA and the other non-IFRS measures presented in this offering
memorandum are commonly used, useful indicators of our financial performance when read in addition
to IFRS measures indicating our financial performance. You should exercise caution in comparing the
non-IFRS measures as reported by us to such measures, similar measures or adjusted variations thereof
reported by other companies.

**Other Data**

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial information and
certain operating data, have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances,
the sum of the numbers in a column or a row in tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given
for that column or row or the sum of certain numbers presented as a percentage may not conform
exactly to the total percentage given.

_the remainder of this offering memorandum. Prospective investors should carefully read this offering_
_memorandum in its entirety, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim Consolidated_

_Notes’’ and the other considerations that are important to their decision to invest in the Notes outlined_
_under ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’_

**Overview**

We are the leading independent operator of vending machines in Europe by revenue, with operations in
21 countries across Europe and leading market shares in our key markets of Switzerland, Sweden and
France. We operate a network of approximately 135,000 active snack and beverage vending machines
on behalf of a broad and diverse client base. We offer a wide range of products in our vending machines,
including hot and cold beverages and various snacks and confectionary items. Our clients include a
large number of both private and public organizations. Our private vending services, which also include
our office coffee services (‘‘OCS’’), are directed primarily at office environments but also include clients
such as hospitals and universities. Our public vending machines are located in high-traffic public
locations, such as airports, train and subway stations and gas stations, where our longer-term client
contracts provide us with a steady stream of revenue. In addition to our public and private vending
operations, we also generate revenue from trade sales of machines and products.

For the year ended September 30, 2013, revenue from our privately placed points of sale, which includes
OCS, accounted for 63.0% of our total revenue. Revenue from OCS alone corresponded to 9.6% of our
total revenue for the same period. For the same period, revenue from our public vending clients, or our
publicly accessible points of sale, accounted for 24.7% of our total revenue. Other revenue and revenue
from trade sales of machines and products accounted for 12.3% of our total revenue for the year ended
September 30, 2013. By product mix, vends of hot drinks accounted for 51.7% of our total revenue for
the year ended September 30, 2013, while vends of snacks and cold drinks accounted for 35.4% of our
total revenue.

Our business model covers the full value chain of the vending services market. Our sales teams originate
new contracts for the placement of vending machines on clients’ premises, and we also bid for
concessions pursuant to public tenders to place vending machines with public entities, such as airports
and train and subway stations. We purchase vending machines for our clients, install them at their
premises and manage the sourcing and stocking of the food and beverage vending products on behalf
of our clients. We also provide cleaning, maintenance and technical support services, which can be
customized based on individual client preferences. In addition to our vending and vending services
operations, we also sell vending machines, vending machine parts and products separately and
independent of vending service arrangements. We therefore generate revenue at each step of the
vending services value chain, through a combination of fees from clients for providing, stocking and
maintaining vending machines, through the products sold from our vending machines and from the sale
of machines, ingredients and spare parts.

We operate our vending machine network primarily under the ‘‘Selecta’’ brand, which we believe stands
for quality and innovation in the industry and enjoys strong brand recognition in many of the markets in
which we operate. We are active across much of Western Europe. For the twelve months ended
March 31, 2014, our vending machine operations in our Central and North regions accounted for 40.8%
and 21.4% of our total revenue, respectively, with France and the United Kingdom contributing 27.8%
and 10.0% of our total revenue, respectively. In terms of market share by revenue, we believe that we
have market shares of approximately 49%, 40% and 11% in Switzerland, Sweden and France,
respectively, based on market size data from the European Vending Association for 2012 and our own
estimates. We are also the overall market leader by revenue in the total European vending market, with
an estimated market share of approximately 7% based on the same market data and estimates.

The European vending machine market is fragmented and characterized by a large number of small
scale vending machine operators. We believe that our business model and our scale provide us with
competitive advantages compared to smaller vending machine operators and present us with
opportunities to benefit from market consolidation in the future. Moreover, as one of the only vending
machine operators with a pan-European platform, we are better positioned than many of our

1

competitors to provide vending services to large multinational clients present in multiple European
countries.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated revenue of e715.0 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of e135.6 million. For the same period, our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.0%.

**Our Strengths**

We believe our competitive strengths include:

**_Diversified and loyal client base with high level of revenue visibility._**

We consider our diverse mix of loyal clients to be one of our key competitive strengths. Our client base
includes a wide range of private and public clients, including companies and office environments,
hospitals and universities as well as airports, train and subway stations and gas stations. We operate a
network of approximately 135,000 active vending machines in 21 countries which further contributes to
our diversified revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2013, our top ten clients accounted for
approximately 18% of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 3.8% of our total
revenue. Our client loyalty is reflected in our high level of client retention. From 2011 to 2013, we estimate
our overall average client retention rate was approximately 93% based on total revenue. In addition to
our loyal client base, our high revenue visibility is also due to the length of our client contracts and the
economic terms agreed in advance. In our private vending and OCS service segments, for example,
typical contract terms range from three to five years, while our contracts for public vending services
typically range from five to ten years.

**_Resilient EBITDA and stable cash flow generation._**

Our Adjusted EBITDA has remained resilient through the economic cycle and increased from
e120.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e132.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2013, despite a challenging economic environment in many of our markets. Furthermore,
through reductions in overhead costs, our Adjusted EBITDA margin has increased from 15.0% for the
year ended September 30, 2011 to 17.9% for the year ended September 30, 2013. The vending machine
operator business is characterized by favorable working capital dynamics, driven in part by immediate
cash collection at points of sale and high inventory rotation. We also benefit from a steady stream of cash
flows from our vending clients, particularly in public vending, with whom we typically enter into
longer-term service agreements. Our weighted average contract life of our top ten clients is
approximately five years. We generated e72.0 million, e80.9 million and e75.5 million of free cash flow in
the years ended September 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Our capital expenditure primarily
relates to investments in new vending machines and refurbishment of our existing vending machine
base. We reduced our total net capital expenditure from e67.8 million for the year ended September 30,
2011 to e37.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. This was due, in part, to the combination of
our relocation of unprofitable vending machines and the introduction of stricter investment thresholds. It
was also attributable to an increase in the volume of refurbishment, which allows us to extend the life
cycle of our vending machines by re-introducing them in locations where we face less competition or
where our clients or consumers do not require the latest technological features.

**_Leading positions in key markets._**

We are the leading European vending machine operator by revenue, with an estimated 7% market share
of the European vending market based on market size data from the European Vending Association for
2012 and our own estimates. We are also the leading vending machine operator by revenue in
Switzerland, Sweden and France, with estimated market shares of approximately 49%, 40% and 11%,
respectively, based on the same market data and estimates. We believe our vending machine density in
these markets and certain other regions allow us to realize economies of scale and, together with our
strong brand awareness, high client loyalty and product quality, further enhance our strong market
positions. In particular, we consider vending machine density to be a competitive advantage, because it
offers us the ability to scale costs, including sales force efficiencies and transportation expenses, across
a large number of machines. In addition, we believe that our scale in this fragmented European vending
market positions us to increase our vending machine density in countries where we currently operate
while also positioning us to benefit from market consolidation should it occur.

-----

**_Consistently high margins in our key markets and regions and opportunity for enhancement._**

For the year ended September 30, 2013, our operations in our Central and North regions generated
Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 26.1% and 22.9%, respectively. We have been the leader by
market share in Switzerland for many years and have continuously grown our market share in Sweden
over the past ten years. Our strong market positions in these markets, together with our ongoing efforts
to optimize vending machine density, help to drive our consistently high margins in these regions. We
are continuing to apply the same concept in our other regions and markets by leveraging management’s
knowhow and experience to drive profitability in other countries. For example, our Adjusted EBITDA
margin in France increased from approximately 8.9% for the year ended September 30, 2011 to 14.4%
for the year ended September 30, 2013. As we enhance our vending machine density in the countries in
which we operate, we believe we will be able to further increase our overall margins.

**_Strategic opportunities and operational initiatives._**

We have capitalized on strategic opportunities in recent years and continue to implement certain
operational initiatives to further drive organic growth. For example, in March 2013, we entered into an
agreement with Starbucks for the exclusive right to operate Starbucks Corner Caf´es in eleven European
countries. Our Starbucks Corner Caf´es are primarily targeted at office environments, and we aim to
further expand the concept in order to establish a leading position in Europe for vends of premium coffee
in the workplace. We have also undertaken certain reorganization measures to reduce our overhead
costs, particularly related to our workforce and costs related to headquarter functions. From
September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2013, we reduced our overhead costs by e27.6 million. When
adjusted for the one-off items included in Adjusted EBITDA from September 30, 2011 to September 30,
2013 of e14.4 million and excluding e6.2 million of overhead costs related to Selecta Italia S.p.A., which
was disposed of in 2012, we reduced our overhead costs from September 30, 2011 to September 30,
2013 by e35.8 million. Furthermore, we have recently implemented certain procurement initiatives, such
as bundling volumes of supplies, focusing on selected suppliers and streamlining our supply chain. We
have also identified and are continuing to develop new solutions for lead generation processes, target
setting and reporting as well as new incentives and tools to promote our sales force effectiveness.

**_Qualified and experienced management team._**

The members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the vending and retail
markets at leading national and multinational companies. Our senior management team has been
strengthened by the recent addition of our Chief Executive Officer in 2013, who has a proven track record
in operational and financial transformations, and our Chief Financial Officer, who previously served as
our Head of Controlling and has extensive experience in business planning and financial reporting. They
joined our two regional directors responsible for the North and Central regions, who have 13 and
28 years of experience, respectively, at Selecta. We believe that the collective industry knowledge and
leadership of our senior management team will enable them to continue to grow our business and
execute our strategies.

**Our Strategy**

Our primary strategy is the profitable organic growth of our business, which we intend to achieve by
focusing on the following strategic objectives:

**_Achieve a leading position in each of the markets in which we operate._**

We aim to be one of the top three players in each of the markets in which we operate while also
maintaining the leading positions we have established in our key markets of Switzerland, Sweden and
France. We intend to leverage these leading positions, together with our pan-European footprint, to
further penetrate the other markets in which we operate and increase our brand awareness. Due to our
established presence and current leading market positions, we believe we are well-positioned to expand
our client base and increase our market share beyond our key markets.

**_Continue to provide a comprehensive concept offering._**

We believe we have a strong reputation and loyal client base due to our innovative and comprehensive
vending solution offerings. We seek to provide a one-stop shop for our clients by also providing them
with as many of their vending service needs as possible. We aim to further penetrate our existing private

3


-----

and public vending client base while increasing our focus on clients such as gas stations, universities
and hospitals and strengthening our ties with caterers and facility management companies. We also
intend to drive growth by exploiting opportunities to cross-sell our product offerings and further roll out
our Starbucks Corner Caf´es concept to drive premium coffee services. In addition, to increase our
vends, we strive to improve our consumer focus through tailored offerings to consumers’ preferences at
our clients’ locations.

**_Maintain focus on operational excellence._**

We continue to focus on operational excellence to deliver products which offer the best combination of
quality, innovation and technology while optimizing internal processes to increase profitability. For
example, we recently implemented certain measures to improve our procurement organization through
the establishment of a professional, more centralized corporate procurement organization. We aim to
further increase bundling of volumes with selected preferred suppliers to achieve better pricing. We also
intend to further increase standardization of our vending machines to reduce overall inventory levels and
streamline our supply chain as well as reduce its complexity. To further drive productivity and improve
technical support for clients through faster reaction times, we intend to equip our merchandisers and
technicians with the latest handheld devices and introduce dynamic route planning. Handheld devices
will allow our technicians and merchandizers to access information remotely while dynamic route
planning will permit us to plan and optimize routes on a real-time basis.

**_Continue to be a leader in innovation and development._**

We aim to provide our clients with high-quality vending machines with advanced technology and
functionality. We continue to develop new machines together with our suppliers to supplement and
replace our current machine portfolio over time. We believe that our focus on technology development in
the areas of cashless payment systems, telemetry and user interfaces will further increase the appeal
and convenience of our vending machines to our clients as well as our vending products to consumers.
Telemetry will allow us to better track vends of our products, adjust our product offerings to drive vends
and monitor more efficiently when vending machines require re-stocking and maintenance. We further
intend to focus on continued development of new offerings for our products and services, such as our
recent Starbucks Corner Caf´es initiative.

Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture governing the
Notes will be secured as of the Issue Date by first-ranking liens
over the Collateral, which includes:

                     - all of the issued share capital of the Guarantors;

                   - certain receivables and intercompany receivables of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, including the assignment of the
Proceeds Loan;

                     - certain intellectual property and insurance policies of certain
Guarantors; and

                     - security interests over certain bank accounts of the Issuer.

-----

The security securing the Notes also secures on a ‘‘super
senior’’ basis the obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility and may also secure additional indebtedness in the
future. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
proceeds of any enforcement of the security interest in the
security will be applied to pay the Revolving Credit Facility and
certain hedge counterparties, if any, in priority to the Notes.
See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.’’ For more information on the security,_
see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Collateral.’’

Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be:

                     - general obligations of the Issuer;

                   - guaranteed by the Guarantors;

                    - secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will
receive proceeds from enforcement of the Liens over the
Collateral only after any obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain priority hedging obligations have
been paid in full, as described under ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Collateral’’;_

                    - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future
obligations of the Issuer that are not subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes, including its obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility;

                  - senior in right of payment to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes;

                  - effectively subordinated to any existing and future
obligations of the Issuer that are secured by property or
assets that do not secure the Notes or that secure the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations on
a priority basis, to the extent of the value of the property and
assets securing such obligations; and

                  - structurally subordinated to any existing and future
obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors.

Each Notes Guarantee will be:

                    - a general obligation of the relevant Guarantor;

                    - secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will
receive proceeds from enforcement of the Liens over the
Collateral only after any obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain priority hedging obligations have
been paid in full, as described under ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Collateral’’;_

                   - pari passu in right of payment to any existing and future
obligations of that Guarantor that are not subordinated in
right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, including its
obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility;

8


-----

                  - effectively subordinated to any existing and future
obligations of such Guarantor that are secured by property
or assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantee or that
secure any obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility
and certain priority hedging obligations to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such obligations;

                  - senior in right of payment to all existing and future
Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right
of payment to such Notes Guarantee; and

                    - subject to certain restrictions on enforcement of Collateral
and release of the Notes Guarantee of any Guarantor to the
extent such Subsidiary is sold by the Security Agent
pursuant to an enforcement action. See ‘‘Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . . . Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with
respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or
deduction for taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless
required by law. If any of the Issuer or Guarantors is required by
law to withhold or deduct for such taxes with respect to a
payment to the holders of Notes, the Issuer or Guarantor will
pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount
received by the holders after the withholding is not less than
the amount they would have received in the absence of the
withholding, subject to certain exceptions. See ‘‘Description of
_the Notes—Additional Amounts.’’_

Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . We will use the gross proceeds of the Notes as set forth in ‘‘Use
_of Proceeds.’’_

Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . . . The Issuer may redeem:

                    - all or part of the Notes at any time prior to December 15,
2016 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
and the applicable ‘‘make-whole’’ premium, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the
date of redemption;

                     - all or part of the Notes at any time on or after December 15,
2016 at the redemption prices described in this offering
memorandum under the caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption,’’ plus accrued and unpaid interest_
and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption;
and

                    - at any time and from time to time prior to December 15, 2016
in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued,
with the proceeds of one or more qualifying equity offerings,
at the redemption price described in this offering
memorandum under the caption ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Optional Redemption,’’ plus accrued and unpaid interest_
and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

9


-----

Redemption for Taxation Reasons . . If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction
impose certain withholding taxes or other deductions on the
payments on the Notes or with respect to a Notes Guarantee,
the Issuer may redeem all but not some of the Notes, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to
the date of redemption. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Redemption for Changes in Taxes.’’_

Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of
control, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase the
Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount of
such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. A change of control
will not be deemed to have occurred on one occasion if a
certain consolidated leverage ratio is not exceeded
immediately prior to and after giving pro forma effect to such
event. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the
_Option of Holders—Change of Control.’’_

Certain Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture governing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees
will contain covenants that, among other things, restrict the
ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain
preferred stock;

                   - make restricted payments, including dividends or other
distributions;

                   - make certain investments;

                     - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                     - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                      - sell, lease or transfer certain assets;

                   - guarantee additional indebtedness without also
guaranteeing the Notes;

                   - create certain restrictions on the ability of restricted
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the
Issuer or a restricted subsidiary;

                    - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or
substantially all of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s assets; and

                     - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes.

Each of these covenants is subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as described under ‘‘Description of
_the Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ In addition, the Issuer will_
provide to the Trustee and to holders of the Notes annual and
quarterly reports of the Issuer.

Denominations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Euro Notes will be issued in global form in denominations

transfer and may only be offered or sold in transactions that are
exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act. See ‘‘Offering and Transfer
_Restrictions.’’_

No Established Public Market for the
Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no
established trading market. Accordingly, there can be no
assurances as to the development or liquidity of any market for

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

The following tables present summary historical consolidated information of Selecta Group B.V. as of
and for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and as of and for the six months ended
March 31, 2013 and 2014. Additionally, the tables below present other financial information for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2014. For a detailed discussion of the presentation of financial information and
other data, see ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data.’’

In our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have restated the financial information relating to the year
2011 to reflect the provision for long service awards in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits.

In our Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, we have adopted IAS 19R for our fiscal year beginning
October 1, 2013, which changed how we account for post-retirement employee benefits. The impact has
been applied retrospectively to our interim financial statements for the six months ended March 31,
2013. The impact has not been applied retrospectively to our Consolidated Financial Statements as at
and for the years ended September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Please refer to notes 2.3 and 2.6 in our
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description and the quantitative impact of the
adoption of IAS 19R.

The following tables also set forth certain unaudited pro forma financial information, after giving effect to
the issuance of the Notes, the entering into the Revolving Credit Facility and the application of the
proceeds as set forth under ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

The following tables also set forth certain historical operating data of the Group as of and for the years
ended September 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and as of and for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The
other financial information and non-financial information is unaudited and is not derived from Selecta
Group B.V.’s financial statements or accounting systems.

The unaudited consolidated financial information presented for the twelve months ended March 31,
2014 has been derived by subtracting from the financial information from the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Selecta Group B.V. for the year ended September 30, 2013, the comparative financial
information from the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the six months ended March 31,
2013, and adding the financial information from the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the six
months ended March 31, 2014. The unaudited consolidated financial information presented for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2014 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not
necessarily representative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at
any future date.

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections ‘‘Presentation of
_Financial and Other Data’’, ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’, ‘‘Capitalization’’, ‘‘Selected Historical Consolidated_
_Financial Information’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in_
_this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the_
_Notes. The risks and uncertainties that we describe below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks_
_and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial could also have a_
_material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If any of the possible_
_events described below occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be_
_materially and adversely affected. If that happens, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the_
_Notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a_
_result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum._
_See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’_

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Changes in general economic conditions, consumer confidence and consumer spending could_**
**_have an adverse effect on our business._**

Our results of operations and financial performance are subject to changes in the general economic
conditions of the markets in which we sell our products, including, in particular, our Central and North
regions, which together accounted for approximately 62.1%, of our total consolidated revenue for the
year ended September 30, 2013, and France and the United Kingdom, which accounted for
approximately 27.5% and 10.4%, respectively, of our total revenue for the same period. Changes in
general economic conditions directly impact consumer confidence and consumer spending as well as
the general business climate and levels of business investment, all of which affect the demand for our
products. Moreover, consumer confidence, consumer spending and/or general economic conditions
may deteriorate significantly and remain depressed for extended periods of time. A negative
development in general economic conditions or consumer confidence and consumer spending could
have a negative effect on our results of operations, revenue and cash flows.

Downturns in general economic conditions and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects
which affect consumers’ disposable income pose a risk to our business, because consumers and
businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit markets, unemployment, negative
financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material adverse effect on
demand for our products. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including general
business conditions, inflation, interest rates, consumer debt levels, unemployment rates and availability
of consumer credit. These and other such macroeconomic factors are outside our control.

Recessionary conditions and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment may also adversely impact
our clients’ decision to contract for a vending machine on their premises as well as consumers’
discretionary consumption patterns. A majority of our vending machines are located in office
environments or other private vending locations. Consequently, the majority of our sales from such
vending machines occur during the working week. There is therefore a correlation between the total
number of items sold through vending machines and work force levels which tend to suffer during
recessionary periods as does consumer purchasing power. Employee retrenchment and uncertain
economic prospects may lead consumers to make fewer beverage, snack and impulse purchases from
our vending machines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Credit and liquidity disruptions in the global financial system could have an adverse effect on_**
**_financing costs and our financial condition._**

As the global financial system has experienced significant credit and liquidity disruptions in recent years,
leading to a reduction in liquidity, greater volatility, general widening of credit spreads and, in some
cases, lack of transparency in money and capital markets, many lenders have reduced or ceased to
provide funding to borrowers. If these conditions continued or worsened, it could negatively affect our
ability to raise funding in the debt capital markets and access bank lending markets on financial terms
acceptable to us or at all. As a result, our financial condition may be adversely impacted and costs of
financing may significantly increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,

21


-----

financial condition and results of operations and consequently on the ability to meet our financial
obligations, including under the Notes.

**_The success of our vending business depends on consumer preferences, technological_**
**_innovations and the consumer’s experience of the vending machines we operate._**

We are a vending services provider operating in the highly competitive segments of the food and
beverage market serving in-between meals, snacks, confectionary products and hot and cold
beverages. Changes in consumer preferences affect both the demand for new vending machines and
the volume of products we sell from our vending machines. Any significant changes in consumer
preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced
demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on
the ability to respond to consumer trends, including concerns of consumers regarding health and
wellness, obesity, product attributes and ingredients. In addition, changes in product category
consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer
preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including the aging of the general population, changes
in social trends, changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns, weather, or negative publicity
resulting from regulatory action or litigation against companies in the snack food and beverage
industries. Any of these or other changes may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the products
we sell and may require us to incur unplanned costs to respond to these changes, which would
negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, existing technologies may be further developed in fields in which we operate which could
impact our business and require significant investments. For example, wireless technology has
developed as a practical medium through which cashless vending payments can be made.
Furthermore, the ability to transmit sales and stock data remotely (telemetry) has led to significant
developments in the vending industry. Other technological advances are also likely to become more
widespread, including payments via mobile phone, vending machines equipped with internet browsers,
vending machines that speak to the visually impaired as well as environmentally-friendly vending
machines which use less energy. If we are unable to adopt such advances in technology, this may
adversely affect our growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our
continued success is also dependent on product innovation, both in terms of offering ever more
advanced vending machines as well as our ability to source new food and beverage products from our
suppliers. Responding to technological changes almost always entails capital expenditures, which
could be above our management’s expectations or strain our cash flow position and may not be fully
recoverable from revenue streams created by such expenditures. There can furthermore be no
assurance that we can acquire or successfully implement new models or variants of existing vending
machine models and/or that we will be successful in stocking such vending machines with the products
that will be most appealing to consumers.

Furthermore, our success is dependent on the consumer’s experience of the vending machines we
operate. To generate revenue and profits, we must stock food and beverage products that appeal to
consumer preferences in vending machines that consistently and reliably dispense the products we
offer. If consumers encounter vending machines that contain undesirable products or that have been
impacted by vandalism or malfunctions, our reputation may suffer and consumers may be deterred from
patronizing our vending machines, leading to lower revenue, which in turn could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We could be adversely affected by changes in governmental regulation and legislation._**

The food and beverage industry is regulated by various European and national legislation and
regulations related to food safety and hygiene, packaging, nutritional information, public tenders for
placement of vending machines on public premises and broader public health and diet concerns. For
example, EU Regulation 852/2004 sets out general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of
foodstuffs and EU Regulation 853/2004 regulates, among other things, the temperature settings of
vending machines that stock products made from or containing animal products, such as meats and
cheeses. In addition, we could be affected in the future by stricter requirements regarding energy
consumption of our vending machines and the use of recyclable or biodegradable containers in
connection with our coffee vending machines. Compliance with such laws and regulations could require
us to make additional investments in new vending machines and equipment, and failure to comply could
result in the imposition of fines and other remedial measures. Any such changes in regulations or costs

22


-----

incurred to comply with stricter regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_An increase in vending rent rates could negatively affect our business._**

We are generally required to pay vending fees, or vending rent, to place vending machines in public
locations, such as airports and train and subway stations and, in certain cases, corporate locations. We
may face pressure from our clients to increase the vending rent we pay to place our vending machines
on their premises in the future. If such vending rent increases or we are unable to respond effectively to
such pricing-related pressures, our profitability could suffer and we may fail to retain or win new clients.
Our vending rent arrangements include fixed and variable rent agreements, or combinations thereof,
and are based on certain factors, including, among others, public tender specifications, expected
revenue, contract length, competitors’ offers and the demographics of the relevant location or locations.
Together with other factors, an increase in vending rent payable to our clients could significantly increase
our operating expenses in future periods and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We operate in a highly competitive market segment, and if we do not compete effectively, we may_**
**_lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our services._**

The market segment of the food and beverage sector in which we operate is highly competitive.
Depending on location, our vending machines compete with a combination of caf´es, kiosks, fast-food
restaurants, delicatessens, sandwich shops, gas stations, convenience stores and supermarkets,
among others. In office environments, in particular, we also compete with coffee machine manufacturers
who offer office coffee services and may seek to expand in that market segment. As a result of this
competitive environment, our suppliers may have significant bargaining advantages because of the
multiple channels through which they can sell and/or distribute their products. Furthermore, an increase
in the number of other locations in close proximity to our vending machines which sell the same or
similar products we sell through our vending machines, or the extension of the opening hours of such
locations, would increase the competitive environment and could result in consumers purchasing
vending products or similar food and beverage product through other channels.

In general, we believe the vending machine operator sector is characterized by extensive logistics,
distribution and maintenance service requirements. The European vending market is currently
fragmented, and future consolidation in the industry among existing operators could adversely affect us.

Certain competitors may also have greater capital and other resources and superior brand recognition
relative to us and may be able to provide more sophisticated vending machines or adopt more
aggressive pricing policies. These competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing
campaigns, secure the most advantageous locations for their vending machines or otherwise make
more attractive offers to clients and consumers. In addition, new market entrants in a particular market
segment, such as Nespresso in the capsule-based coffee segment, could increase competition in office
coffee services. New market entrants in a particular country or region could also lead to oversaturation in
the market, limiting our growth potential in that area. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
compete successfully in our market segment, and a loss in market share or other factors described
above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to maintain or increase prices in response to competitive pressures may also be limited.
Additionally, increasing operating costs, including vending rents with certain clients, may offset
improvements on margins that rising prices might otherwise produce. As a result, we cannot assure you
that competitive dynamics will not require us to make investments into our vending machine stock, or
that we will be able to increase prices with sufficient flexibility and speed to preserve or increase our
margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

**_We face various political, economic, legal, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated_**
**_with conducting business in multiple countries._**

Our business and results of operations are subject to various risks inherent in international operations
over which we have little or no control. These risks include, among others:

- transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels and suppliers;

23


-----

- longer payment cycles for and greater difficulty collecting client accounts receivable;

- the ability to finance our foreign operations;

- fluctuations in currency exchange and currency controls;

- economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions in which our manufacturers are
located, such as Russia, which among other things, may expose the operations of our manufacturers
to risk and increase our manufacturing costs or result in delivery delays;

- trade restrictions, higher tariffs and changes to existing, or the imposition of additional regulations
relating to import or export of our products;

- unfavorable changes in tax or other laws, including the imposition of new laws or regulations that
restrict our operations or increase our cost of operations;

- work stoppages and sudden or unexpected increases in wages;

- political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of
trade and other business restrictions; and

- difficulties in obtaining the protections of the intellectual property laws of other countries.

The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are
unpredictable; however, the effects of any of these occurrences, or any combination thereof, could have
a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We depend on a limited number of manufacturers for the manufacture of the vending machines we_**
**_require to operate our business._**

We do not manufacture our vending machines, although we do have limited in-house machine
refurbishment and customization capabilities. We currently source our vending machines from a limited
numbers of manufacturers, and we intend to further concentrate our sourcing of vending machines to
four suppliers for the majority of vending machine purchases in the future. We currently, and will
increasingly, rely on such manufacturers to produce high-quality vending machines in adequate
quantities to meet clients’ demands. If one or more of our vending machine manufacturers were to
experience severe financial difficulties or cease operations, our ability to source new vending machines
or component parts could be disrupted and a prolonged interruption could have a significant adverse
effect on our business. Any decline in quality, disruption in production or inability of the manufacturers to
produce the machines we require in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner, whether as a result of a
natural disaster, labor strikes, financial difficulties or other causes, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Disruptions in our supply and logistics chain could adversely affect us._**

A disruption in our supply and logistics chain caused by transportation disruptions, delays or increased
expenses, labor strikes, product recalls or other unforeseen events could adversely affect our ability to
restock our vending machines or repair, maintain and retrofit our vending machines. If we cannot secure
alternative sources of supply or effectively manage a disruption if it occurs, daily vends and thereby
revenue could be reduced until we are able to address the situation and we are unlikely to recoup the
loss of such vends. See ‘‘—A failure of our key information technology and inventory management
_systems or processes could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.’’ These_
events could cause our revenue to decline, require additional resources to restore our supply and
logistics chain or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is exposed to fluctuations in costs related to fuel, coffee and other commodity prices._**

Our business operations rely on frequent restocking and maintenance of vending machines at a
multitude of locations. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in costs related to fuel and other
transportation inputs. In addition, we source significant amounts of coffee for the operation of our coffee
vending machines, including our own miofino brand of coffee blends. Supply and price of coffee beans
can be affected by multiple factors, such as weather, pest damage, politics, competitive pressures and
economics in the producing countries. The price of green bean coffee has fluctuated significantly in
recent years. For example, the price of Arabica coffee increased by more than 100% from March 2010 to
May 2011 and prices ranged from US$3.10 per pound in April 2011 to US$1.10 per pound in November

24


-----

2013 (based on the ICE ‘C’ New York index). We also procure food and beverage products from
suppliers, the costs of which are indirectly linked to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities such
as cocoa and sugar. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in passing on cost increases
to clients or consumers without losses in vends, revenue or gross margin. As a consequence, sudden
and significant changes in the prices of coffee and other commodities could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

**_Our business requires capital expenditures which may divert significant cash flow from other_**
**_investments or uses, including debt servicing._**

As of March 31, 2014, we owned and operated a network of approximately 135,000 active vending
machines. As part of our business model, we acquire new vending machines for new client sites,
refurbish our existing vending machines and replace those that reach obsolescence from our existing
installed vending machine base. In the year ended September 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013, our total capital
expenditures amounted to e72.3 million, e53.8 million and e44.9 million, respectively, of which our total
capital expenditures for vending machines and related equipment were e57.4 million, e44.3 million and
e38.0 million, respectively. Despite the overall reduction in total capital expenditure, we expect that our
capital expenditures related to the purchase of new vending machines will increase in the future to
support the investment required to deliver new business growth and maintain the existing vending
machine park. Based on a vending machine park asset value (at cost) of approximately e543.2 million as
of September 30, 2013 and an estimated average asset life of ten years for our active vending machines,
we estimate that we will require capital expenditures of approximately e54 million per year on vending
machines to support our current level of revenue in addition to capital expenditure for vehicles, IT and
other equipment. We further estimate we will require approximately e3 million of capital expenditure per
year to support each additional per cent of revenue growth. Our estimates with respect to such future
capital expenditure requirements may vary based on changes in our product, concept and segment mix.
However, as our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on different capital
intensity in different business segments, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to new business,
levels of capital expenditure funded through new machines versus refurbished machines and specific
initiatives to develop telemetry and cashless payment technologies, among other factors, we can
provide no assurance that our capital expenditure will not increase more than we anticipate. Such
increases may divert significant cash flows from other investments or uses, including debt servicing,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Certain products we sell are susceptible to seasonal variation and sustained periods of abnormal_**
**_weather can have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our vends of certain products have historically been affected by seasonal variation during the year.
Many of our vending machines include cold drinks, which have historically generated increased vends
during the summer months. Coffee vends generally exhibit less variation, but can also be affected by
seasonal factors, especially for our vending machines inside offices or in other private locations, where
vends are lower during holiday times. In addition, severe weather can influence consumer traffic patterns
in high-traffic areas such as gas stations, train and subway stations and airports. If, for example,
transportation services are closed due to heavy snow or rain, our vending machines in those locations
may be accessible by significantly fewer consumers and vends lost on a particular business day
typically cannot be recouped in the future. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to
manage effectively the stocking of our products influenced by seasonal variation or that severe weather
events will not reduce our vends at certain locations, the occurrence of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The loss of major clients and/or the inability to establish new client relationships could adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We compete to maintain existing clients and to establish new client relationships in our markets;
however, we can give no assurance of our ability to maintain or renew existing contracts or enter into new
contracts. For example, in 2012, we did not succeed in the re-tender process to provide vending services
to Paresto, a large client in the Netherlands. Similarly, in 2013, we were unsuccessful in our re-tender to
provide vending services to Total in Germany and de-installed those vending machines in the third
quarter of 2013. In addition to our private vending client contracts, we also maintain contracts with public
clients which generally have longer contract terms that are awarded pursuant to public tenders

25


-----

according to EU and national public tenders laws. We can give no assurance that we can successfully
compete in future auction processes for public service contracts or that current public vending clients
will continue to welcome vending machines on their premises. We are also subject to the risk that such
contracts with public clients could face legal challenge because public tender rules were not followed.
We can provide no assurance that the loss of any single client or group of clients would not adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_A failure of our key information technology and inventory management systems or processes_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business._**

We rely extensively on information technology, inventory management systems and processes for our
day-to-day operations. These systems and processes include, but are not limited to, ordering and
managing stock from suppliers, coordinating the logistics of restocking of our vending machines,
distributing products to various locations, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of
operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to
manage the business. If such systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may suffer
interruptions in our ability to manage operations, which could negatively affect our revenue and results
of operations by impeding our ability to distribute products and restock our vending machines. These
interruptions could be caused by any number of events, ranging from catastrophic events to power
outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a
timely basis, or if our employees knowledgeable about such systems are unavailable or cease to work
for us. Moreover, because consumer decisions to purchase snack food and beverages are contextually
specific and can change on a day-to-day basis (or even during the course of a day), a lost vend due to a
vending machine malfunction or a lack of stock cannot typically be recouped once the malfunction has
been addressed and/or the vending machine has been restocked _(i.e. a consumer who cannot_
purchase a product one day because of a malfunction would not likely, as a result, purchase two such
products the following day once the malfunction has been addressed). Failures in our systems could
therefore reduce our revenue, adversely affect our reputation among our clients and consumers
generally, compromise our competitive position or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our success is dependent, in part, upon the integrity of our management and employees, and our_**
**_risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law._**

Our business operations involve risks associated with fraud, bribery and corruption, or allegations
thereof, including with respect to our own employees as well as our clients and the award of public
tenders by public authorities to offer vending services. In particular, our business operations involve the
transfer of large volumes of cash money between locations, which exposes us to the risk of loss or theft.
Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient in order to prevent or detect
inadequate practices, fraud and violations of law by our management, employees or agents. Therefore,
we may be unable to detect or prevent every instance of theft, fraud, bribery and corruption involving our
employees, management, directors, agents or other third parties in the future. To the extent we are not
successful in protecting ourselves from such activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties
and to reputational damage as a result of such occurrences. Allegations, proceedings and convictions
with regard to certain crimes including, inter alia, fraud, bribery and corruption may make it more difficult
for us to obtain or acquire new clients or render us ineligible to participate in public tenders. The
involvement or association of our employees, management, directors or agents with theft, fraud, bribery
or corruption and other crimes committed in relation to our activities, or allegations or rumors relating
thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_We are involved from time to time in various tax audits and investigations and may face tax liabilities_**
**_in the future._**

We are from time to time subject to tax audits and investigations by the tax authorities in the countries
where we operate, which include investigations with respect to the direct tax and indirect tax regime of
any of our transactions and/or value-added tax classification of products sold through our vending
machines. Adverse developments in tax laws or regulations, or any change in position by the relevant
taxing authority regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or on

26


-----

our ability to service or otherwise make payments on the Notes and our other indebtedness. In addition,
the relevant tax authorities may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the
tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. We could also fail, whether inadvertently or
through reasons beyond our control, to comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment
of our transactions or financing arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such
transactions or arrangements, and possibly lead to significant fines or penalties. It may be necessary to
defend our tax filings in court if a reasonable settlement cannot be reached with the relevant tax
authorities and such ensuing litigation could be costly and distract management from the other affairs of
our business. Tax audits and investigations by the competent tax authorities may generate negative
publicity which could harm our reputation with clients, suppliers and counterparties. We can provide no
assurance that the financial impact of any adverse tax adjustment in connection with our business would
not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance is limited and subject to exclusions, and depends on the ongoing viability of our_**
**_insurers; we may also incur liabilities or losses that are not covered by insurance._**

We currently have in place various insurance policies which cover general liability, property damage and
losses due to the interruption of our business in accordance with market practice in the industry and
subject to customary conditions. Our vending machines are generally insured against damage and
vandalism by our clients pursuant to provisions of our client contracts which require such insurance to
be procured by the client or included as part of its general insurance policy coverage. Our other fixed
assets, such as our office buildings, technical equipment used in distribution, restocking and vending
machine refurbishment, information technology and office equipment, are protected by a group
insurance policy (damages from fire, catastrophes, theft, flood and severe weather) that includes a
business interruption insurance when business interruption is caused by an insured property damage.

Our insurance policies are subject to limits and exclusions. Furthermore, we do not have insurance
coverage for all interruptions as a result of operational risks because such risks cannot be insured or can
only be insured on inadequate or onerous terms. There can be no assurance that our insurance program
would be sufficient to cover all potential losses, that we will be able to obtain sufficient levels of property
insurance coverage in the future or that such coverage will be available on terms acceptable to us.

Moreover, certain types of losses, such as those resulting from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes,
environmental hazards or terrorist acts, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. We use our
discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits, deductibility provisions and the appropriateness of
self-insuring with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and on
suitable terms. If we suffer an uninsured or underinsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of the capital
we have invested in a business or property as well as the anticipated future revenue from such business
or property. Such uninsured or underinsured losses could harm our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We are exposed to credit risk related to our clients which may cause us to make larger allowances_**
**_for doubtful trade receivables or incur write-offs related to impaired debts._**

We engage in numerous sales transactions with our clients and suppliers, and we are subject to the risk
that one or more of these counterparties becomes insolvent and therefore becomes unable to discharge
their obligations to us. Such risk may be exacerbated by events or circumstances that are inherently
difficult to anticipate or control. If one of our counterparties were to default on its obligations or otherwise
be unable to discharge its contractual obligations, this could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operation.

**_Our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key employees._**

We depend on certain key executives and personnel for our success. Our performance and our ability to
implement our strategies depend on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key employees.
Our operations could be adversely affected if, for any reason, a number of these officers or key
employees do not remain with us. In the event that such key personnel choose not to remain with us,
there is a risk that they may join a competing business. Furthermore, there may be a limited number of
persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to replace key
employees with qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Our ability to recruit, motivate and retain
personnel is important to our success, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.

27


-----

**_We may face labor disruptions that could interfere with our operations and have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

As of March 31, 2014, we employed 4,427 full-time equivalents under a variety of arrangements
consistent with local laws and employment practices. The countries in which we operate provide various
protections and bargaining or other rights to employees. These employment rights may require us to
expend greater time and costs in altering or amending employees’ terms of employment or
discontinuing employment relationships.

In certain instances, we consult and seek the input of our employee works councils with respect to a
broad range of matters. Consultations with works councils, strikes, similar industrial actions or other
disturbances by our workforce could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of reputation, increased
wages and benefits or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

There can be no assurance that there will not be labor disputes and/or adverse employee relations in the
future. Disruptions of business operations due to strikes or similar measures by our employees or the
employees of any of our significant suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of the brand names of certain of the key products we sell_**
**_may adversely affect our competitive position._**

We stock and sell in our vending machines a broad range of brand name products whose brands are
owned by our suppliers or other third parties. We have limited control over such brands, and any failure
on the part of the owners of such brands to defend their intellectual property rights or preserve and build
their brands’ reputations could compromise such reputations or the public’s perception of such brands,
thereby diminishing the value of such brands and potentially adversely impacting our revenue, our
reputation and our competitive position.

**_We are susceptible to claims of anti-competitive practices._**

Part of our overall strategy is to be a market leader in each of the markets in which we operate. For this
reason, and taking into particular consideration our leading market positions in Switzerland, Sweden
and France, we may be accused of the abuse of our position or the use of anti-competitive practices.
This risk may increase in the event we acquire companies that have market leading positions in the
countries in which we operate. Any such claims could adversely affect our reputation, potentially result in
legal proceedings that could have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations and require us to divest assets in markets where we have a dominant or leading position.
Such claims could also impair our ability to conduct acquisitions accretive to our business. Before
certain future acquisitions can be consummated, we may be required to seek approvals and consents
from regulatory agencies or there may be applicable waiting periods that will need to expire. We may be
unable to obtain such regulatory approvals or consents, or, in order to obtain them, we may be required
to dispose of assets or take other actions that could have the effect of reducing our revenue. Even if
regulatory authorities do not require disposals or other actions, the regulatory approval process
triggered by our market position or claims of anti-competitive practices may have the effect of delaying
acquisitions.

**_We are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings in the normal course of our_**
**_business and otherwise._**

We are subject to the risk of legal claims and proceedings and regulatory enforcement actions in the
ordinary course of our business and otherwise. From time to time, we have been party as defendant or
plaintiff to various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our business, such as those
related to employment matters and VAT payments and refunds. The results of pending or future legal
proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, and we can provide no assurance that we will not incur
losses in connection with current or future legal or regulatory proceedings (including tax audits) or
actions that exceed any provision we may set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or that
exceed any insurance coverage available, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

28


-----

**_Increases in labor and employment costs may have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

Our labor and employment costs may rise in the future, or rise faster than expected, as a result of
minimum wage increases, increased workforce activism, government decrees and changes in social
and pension contribution rules meant to reduce government budget deficits or to increase welfare
benefits to employees. We may not be able to offset increases in labor and employment costs through
productivity gains. If labor and employment costs increase in the future, our operating costs will
increase, which could, if we cannot recover these costs from our clients or consumers through increased
selling prices or offset them through productivity gains or other measures, have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We have a history of net losses, and we may experience net losses in the future._**

Although we had a net profit of e0.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2013, we reported net
losses for the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2012 as well as for the six months ended March 31,
2014. We may continue to report net losses until such time as we are able to achieve sufficient levels of
revenue and earnings before interest and income tax to offset finance costs. There is no guarantee that
we will be able to do so, and we may report net losses in future periods. We cannot predict what impact
future net losses might have on our ability to finance our operations or pay interest or principal on the
Notes when due.

**_We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may not realize the full value thereof._**

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. As of March 31, 2014, the Group’s total goodwill,
which represents the excess of the cost of acquisitions over our interest in the net fair value of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognized, amounted to e483.1 million,
representing 35.8% of the Group’s total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever
there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in
our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, and a variety of
other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to our income
statement. Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material reductions of our income and equity
under IFRS.

**_The interests of our principal shareholder may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of_**
**_Notes._**

The interests of our principal shareholder, ACP, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests
as holders of the Notes (the ‘‘Holders’’). Our principal shareholder has, and will continue to have,
directly or indirectly, the ability, among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our
day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve any
other changes to our operations. For example, our principal shareholder could vote to cause us to incur
additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends distributions, in each case, so
long as the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so
permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the
sale of certain assets could reduce our ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect
the Holders.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and_**
**_prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

After the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2014, after adjusting for the
_pro forma effects of the Transactions, we would have total net debt of approximately_ e551.2 million
(equivalent). See ‘‘Capitalization.’’

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to the Holders in the Offering, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

29


-----

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development
or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such additional borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our
indebtedness and to fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future
operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from
operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors
and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations nor obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures.

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance future operations_**
**_and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility will restrict, among other things, our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- make restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- make certain investments;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create or permit to exist certain liens;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets;

- guarantee additional indebtedness without also guaranteeing the Notes;

- create certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
payments to the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary;

- merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or a
Guarantor’s assets; and

- impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ Despite these exceptions and qualifications, the covenants to which we are_
subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue
business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond
our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of
these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, and the relevant lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid
interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing
that debt. This could also result in an event of default under the Indenture. If the debt under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees or any other material financing
arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the
Notes and our other debt. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or
cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these
circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other
indebtedness then outstanding, including the Notes. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.’’_

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which_**
**_we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the
Revolving Credit Facility and our obligations under the Notes, and to fund our ongoing operations, will
depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to
general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other
factors discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors,’’ many of which are beyond our control.

At the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes or any other debt which we may incur, if we do
not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources to pay our debt
obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs or we are otherwise restricted from doing so due to
corporate, tax or contractual limitations, we may be required to refinance or restructure our
indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain such
refinancing or restructuring on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to reduce or delay our
business activities, planned acquisitions or capital expenditures, sell assets, or raise additional debt or
equity financing in amounts that could be substantial. The type, timing and terms of any future financing
will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to accomplish any of these measures in a timely manner or on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement may limit our ability to pursue any of these measures. Furthermore, any
failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis
would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could impact our ability to incur additional
indebtedness.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness, including at the level of our subsidiaries, which could_**
**_increase our risk exposure from debt and could decrease your share in any proceeds._**

Subject to restrictions in the Indenture, we may incur additional indebtedness (including under revolving
credit facilities that we may enter into after the Issue Date), which could increase the risks associated
with our already substantial indebtedness. We have the ability to borrow up to e50.0 million under our
Revolving Credit Facility, together with the amount of any permitted additional revolving credit facilities,
and any borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be senior secured indebtedness, and will
receive proceeds from an enforcement action on the Collateral in priority to the Notes.

The terms of the Indenture will permit us to incur substantial indebtedness in the future, further
increasing the risks associated with our significant leverage. Any indebtedness that we incur at a
non-Guarantor subsidiary level would be structurally senior to the Notes. Accordingly, we could raise
additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and
under certain circumstances, the amount of the indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with
those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will not prevent us from incurring other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under
those agreements.

**_Our Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing_**
**_our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Our Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR,
LIBOR and STIBOR, as applicable, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could
rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix
a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be
available on commercially reasonable terms. To the extent that interest rates were to increase
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our cash flow.

**_Hedging agreements may expose us to credit default risks and potential losses if our hedging_**
**_counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

We may enter into interest hedging agreements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates,
primarily under the Revolving Credit Facility. We may also enter currency hedging arrangements in
respect of a series of Notes denominated in euros or CHF and the Revolving Credit Facilities. Under any

31


-----

such agreements, we would be exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our
counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging
arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise
terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would
result in a loss.

**Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its_**
**_obligations on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own, and has not engaged
in, and will not be permitted to engage in, any activities other than those relating to its finance activities.
The Issuer has no significant assets other than the shares it holds in its subsidiaries and the Proceeds
Loans pursuant to which it on-lends proceeds of the Offering to Selecta AG. Payment of interest and
repayment of our indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be wholly dependent on the ability of our
subsidiaries to make such cash available to us, by either dividend distributions or intercompany loans,
or both. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future
indebtedness or by law, in their ability to make such dividend distributions or advance upstream loans to
enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of our
subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions
may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

While the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement limit the ability of our subsidiaries to
incur contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to
us, these limitations are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. We cannot assure
you that arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing
existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow
generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes.

In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be
unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes. We do not expect to have any
other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to the Holders.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares, if any, of our_**
**_non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. As payments on the Notes are only
required to be made by the Issuer and the Guarantors, no payments are required to be made from
assets of subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes unless those assets are transferred by dividend or
otherwise to the Issuer or any of the Guarantors. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-Guarantor
subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its
parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes under the Notes Guarantees. In the event of any
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their
trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries
before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each
Notes Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and
preference shareholders (if any) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**_Creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging arrangements and certain debt that_**
**_we may incur in the future will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in_**
**_any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes._**

The Notes will, to the extent permitted under law, be secured by the same Collateral that will secure our
obligations on a first-ranking basis under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if
any. The Indenture will also permit the same Collateral to be pledged on a pari passu basis with the
Notes, to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement may limit the amount of hedging that can be
‘‘super-priority’’ hedging.

32


-----

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations, as well as
certain future indebtedness permitted to be incurred in accordance with the Indenture will have priority
over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with
respect to such Collateral. Additionally, certain liabilities or obligations may have priority over or rank pari
_passu in respect of any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral due to the rules of the applicable_
laws (including, without limitation, costs of enforcement actions, tax liabilities, liabilities to employees of
a bankrupt entity). In the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not be able to recover on such
Collateral if the then outstanding claims under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and such
amounts in respect of such hedging obligations and any other ‘‘super-priority’’ indebtedness are greater
than the proceeds realized. In addition, any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any
creditor will, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and such amounts in
respect of such hedging obligations and other ‘‘super-priority’’ indebtedness have been discharged
from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of any other obligations secured by such
Collateral. Such additional indebtedness secured by the Collateral may be significant. As a result, the
Holders may receive less, ratably, than holders of other secured indebtedness.

**_The Holders may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

Pursuant to the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging agreements, if any (the
‘‘Super Senior Creditors’’) will have effective control with respect to the Collateral upon enforcement.
The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent will serve as Security Agent for the
secured parties under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes with respect to the shared Collateral. In
the event that the shared Collateral has become enforceable, the Security Agent shall subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement enforce or refrain from enforcing such Collateral on the instructions
of (a) the majority (more than 66[2]⁄3% by value) of the Super Senior Creditors and (b) the majority (more
than 50% by value) of the holder of the Notes and other pari passu creditors (if any).

However, disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to
the shared Collateral. If the Security Agent receives conflicting instructions from the majority Super
Senior Creditors and from the majority of the holders of the Notes and the pari passu creditors, then, to
the extent instructions from the holders of the Notes and the pari passu creditors are given in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will comply with such instructions, provided that, if
the liabilities owed to the Super Senior Creditors have not been fully and finally discharged in cash within
six months of the relevant proposed enforcement instruction date or if no enforcement has occurred
within three months of the relevant proposed enforcement instruction date, the instructions of the
majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

The creditors under our Revolving Credit Facility may have interests that are different from the interests
of holders of the Notes, and they may elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the shared Collateral at
a time and in a manner which would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Issuer or the shares of any
of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement,
claims under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets securing the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees may be released. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Collateral—Release of the Collateral.’’_

**_The Holders may be limited in their ability to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders
of the Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent has the
right to enforce the Security Documents relating to the Collateral on behalf of the Trustee and the holders
of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests in the Collateral and be barred from taking enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee who will (subject to the provisions of such
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent.

33


-----

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets,
but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some
uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the
Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security Agent (‘‘Parallel Debt’’)
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards holders of the Notes under or in
connection with the Indenture (‘‘Principal Obligations’’). The pledges in such jurisdictions will be
granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the
Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same
time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel
Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore,
the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition,
the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the
extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly
granted or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any
proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and
other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by
other creditors that have the benefit of first-ranking liens in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or
after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as
well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the firstranking liens can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of
perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under English law.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain
the consent of a third party (including, without limitation, relevant governmental agencies, e.g., relevant
competition authorities) to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will
be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties
will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent
may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly
decrease.

In relation to Dutch bank account pledges, most Dutch financial institutions apply general banking
conditions to relationships with their clients, on the basis of which a financial institution, among other
things, may have a first ranking pledge and a right of set-off with respect to the bank accounts
maintained with it. In addition, pursuant to such general banking conditions a pledge on claims arising
from the bank accounts maintained with that financial institution may be prohibited without its
permission. It is also possible that the claims arising from the bank accounts are contractually, on the
basis of the general banking conditions, made incapable of transfer. In principle, this will render the
claims incapable of being pledged under Dutch law, unless such restriction is waived by the financial
institution. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any such permission and/or waiver.

Furthermore, under Swedish law, a pledgee of a security interest in any asset is, when exercising its
rights as a secured party or liquidating a secured asset, under a fiduciary duty to protect the interest of
the pledgor. This duty includes an obligation to notify the pledgor of any liquidation or sale of the
Collateral, to account for the proceeds of such liquidation or sale, and to pay to the pledgor that portion
of the proceeds of such liquidation or sale which exceeds the debt secured by such asset. There are
provisions in the Swedish Contracts Act which prohibit an enforcing party from foreclosing a secured

34


-----

asset by assuming ownership of the secured asset without accounting for the value thereof. In case of
realization of any Swedish law security interest created over trademarks, all known parties concerned
must, pursuant to the Swedish Trademarks Act, be notified prior to such realization.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation of_**
**_the business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, certain of the Collateral.
So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors, may, among other things, subject to the terms of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, without any release or consent by the applicable Trustee or the Security Agent,
conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral such as selling, modifying, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments,
including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral,
which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the
case of an enforcement of the liens on the Collateral. To the extent these activities are allowed with
regard to certain security interests, under Swedish law such security interests could be considered to be
not validly perfected. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Sweden.’’_

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the Holders. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted_**
**_by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure our obligations under the Notes and the
obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted directly to the Holders but
will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor
Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a
consequence, Holders will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, which will (subject to
the applicable provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes or the_**
**_incurrence of permitted debt in the future may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may create hardening
periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to
secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such
hardening periods in particular, as the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted
in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future
indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the
moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security
interest granted, perfected or re-created were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening
period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible
to enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding
up proceeding after the Issue Date, any security interest in Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would
face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being avoided by the grantor or by
its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a
preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the
Holders would lose the benefit of the security interest. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’ The same rights_
and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the accession
of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant
assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Collateral.’’_

35


-----

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_applicable Collateral or Notes Guarantees will be released without your consent or the consent of_**
**_the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral will be released, including, but not limited to:

- in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or
assets (including capital stock of Subsidiaries) to a Person (as defined in ‘‘Description of the Notes’’)
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the
Indenture;

- in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of capital stock of that Guarantor or any
holding company of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not
violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

- in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets of such Guarantor;

- if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as defined in
‘‘Description of the Notes’’) in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the release of the
property and assets, and capital stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’;

- in accordance with the covenant described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—No
_Impairment of Security Interest’’;_

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and
‘‘Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge’’;

- as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in
‘‘Description of the Notes’’); and

- upon a release of the Lien that resulted in the creation of the Lien under the covenant described under
‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’

In addition, under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees will be released, including, but not
limited to:

- upon a sale or other disposition of all the capital stock of the relevant Guarantor or of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

- if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

- pursuant to a transaction permitted by the covenant as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;_

- as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’; and

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and
_‘‘Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge.’’_

See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the
_Notes.’’_

**_We may not be able to comply with the terms and covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility._**

On or prior to the Issue Date, we will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility. If our operations deteriorate,
we may not have sufficient cash flow to service borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In
addition, if our results of operations deteriorate, we may not be able to comply with the financial
covenant included in the Revolving Credit Facility, which would result in a default under the credit facility.
If we are not able to make interest or principal payments on our debt, we might have to refinance our

36


-----

indebtedness or issue additional equity or other securities and may not be successful in those efforts or
may not obtain new financing on favorable terms.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control (as defined in the Indenture), the
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that the Issuer would
have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other
then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of
control may result in an event of default and/or mandatory prepayment obligation under, or acceleration
of, our Revolving Credit Facility, the Notes and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other
indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from
its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of
control may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs
at a time when our subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Notes, our subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness
to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from
repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to
obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default
under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Indenture and certain other indebtedness. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase
_at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.’’_

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in
the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar
transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve
a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘change of
control’’ as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase
_at the Option of Holders—Change of Control’’, the Indenture will not contain provisions that would_
require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization,
restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of ‘‘change of control’’ in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is
a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may
be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Each Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Notes Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Notes
Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable
law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses.
See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses
available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these
laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance,
preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are
applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Notes Guarantee depending
on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments
obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Notes Guarantee
against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and
other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes
Guarantee, (ii) direct that the Holders of Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the
relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is
detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

- the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over
another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions,
when the granting of the Notes Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the
recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee;

- the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for
the relevant Notes Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of
the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the
relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness
beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

- the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in
the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee
granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
‘‘insolvent’’ at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not
determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of
whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments to
holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in
such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a
court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a
possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and
voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any
claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable,
of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event
that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed

38


-----

limitation of the Notes Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all
liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any
Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside,
we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

The payment of dividends or principal and interest on the intercompany loan to the Issuer will reduce the
distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and
Security Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and
reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments or
payments of principal and interest on the intercompany loan that reduce our distributable profits and
reserves to zero. We intend to make dividends and enter into intercompany loans to service
indebtedness and for tax planning purposes. There can be no assurances that we will have distributable
profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes Guarantees and Security
Documents, whether or not we distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. The payment of
dividends or principal or interest on the intercompany loan to service our debt obligations (including
under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the
Notes Guarantees. In addition, the payment under the Notes Guarantees and the enforcement of
security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities
to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and
board resolutions.

See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the delay in or failure to grant or perfect_**
**_security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party, the grantor
of the security or both parties. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with
respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of
these liens or if it has been agreed that such perfection steps shall not be taken on the basis that such
steps have undesirable effects. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights
acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a
certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property
and rights are acquired and identified. Under Swedish law, a security interest over an asset can only be
validly perfected if the grantor is deprived of its right to control and deal with the asset. For example,
under the security over trade receivables, the security grantor will be allowed to receive and retain
payments until the occurrence of an acceleration event, and therefore security over such trade
receivables will not be perfected until an acceleration event has occurred. To the extent security granted
by a Swedish company is granted or perfected later than on the date of the issuance of the Notes, the
holders of the Notes will face a greater risk that such security would be subject to clawback in the event
of the bankruptcy of Swedish security providers. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—Sweden.’’_

**_You may be required to pay a ‘‘soulte’’ in the event you decide to enforce a pledge over securities_**
**_granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of_**
**_securities rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be enforced
following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount that is due and remaining
unpaid. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities
account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be
enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale
of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured
creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged securities or (ii) by
way of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors,
following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured
creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual
foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed
securities. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure (attribution

39


-----

_judiciaire) or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte_
_commissoire). In a proceeding regarding a judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or a contractual_
foreclosure (pacte commissoire), an expert is appointed to value the Collateral (in this case, the
securities) and if the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor
may be required to pay the pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the securities
and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately
received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to
the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an
enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a
going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect
the value of our business as a going concern. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—France—Limitations on_
_enforcement of security interests and ‘‘soulte’’.’’_

**_Due to restrictions on the deduction of interest expenses under foreign tax laws, we may be unable_**
**_to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

Interest payments on the Notes, the PIK Proceeds Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility may not be fully
deductible for tax purposes, which could adversely affect our financial results. Subject to certain
prerequisites, the laws of foreign countries, such as Switzerland, France, Finland and Sweden, among
others, impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest for tax purposes. Any restriction on the
deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes would have negative consequences for our financial
condition and results of operations.

**_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of_**
**_the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to_**
**_service our indebtedness._**

Under Article 212 § II of the French _Code g´en´eral des impˆots (‘‘French Tax Code’’), deductions of_
interest paid on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax
Code or on loans granted by a third party but guaranteed by a related party (such third party being
assimilated to a related party) may be subject to certain limitations. Deduction for interest paid on such
loans may be partially disallowed in the fiscal year during which they are incurred if such interest exceed
each of the following thresholds: (i) the amount of interest multiplied by the ratio of (a) 1.5 times the
company’s net equity and (b) the average amount of indebtedness owed to related parties (or to third
parties assimilated to related parties) over the relevant fiscal year; (ii) 25% of the company’s earnings
before tax (as increased by certain items for the purpose of these limitations); and (iii) the amount of
interest received by the company from related parties (or from third parties assimilated to related
parties). Deduction may be disallowed for the portion of interest that exceeds, in a relevant fiscal year,
the highest of the above three limitations if such portion of interest exceeds e150,000, unless the
company is able to demonstrate for the relevant fiscal year that the indebtedness ratio of the group to
which it belongs is higher or equal to its own indebtedness ratio. Moreover, specific rules apply to
companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups (int´egration fiscale).

In addition, Article 209 § IX of the French Tax Code imposes restrictions on the deductibility of interest
expenses incurred by a French company if such company has acquired shares of another company
qualifying as ‘‘titres de participation’’ within the meaning of Article 219 § I a quinquies of the French Tax
Code and if such acquiring company cannot demonstrate, with respect to the fiscal years running over
the twelve-month period from the acquisition of the shares (or with respect to the first fiscal year opened
after January 1, 2012 for shares acquired during a fiscal year opened prior to such date), that (i) the
decisions relating to such acquired shares are actually taken by the company having acquired them (or,
as the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a company directly
controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L 233-3 § I of the French Code de
_commerce (‘‘French Commercial Code’’), that is located in France) and (ii) where control or an_
influence is exercised over the acquired company, such control or influence is exercised by the acquiring

40


-----

company (or, as the case may be, by a company controlling the acquiring company or by a company
directly controlled by such controlling company, within the meaning of Article L 233-3 § I of the French
Commercial Code, that is located in France).

Moreover, Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code provides for a general limitation of deductibility of net
financial charges, subject to certain exceptions. 25% of the adjusted net financial charges incurred by
French companies that are subject to French corporate income tax and are not members of a French tax
consolidated group (int´egration fiscale) are added-back to their taxable result in respect of fiscal years
opened as from January 1, 2014, to the extent that such companies’ net financial charges (i.e. financial
charges decreased by certain financial income) are at least equal to e3.0 million in a given fiscal year.
Under Article 223 B bis of the French Tax Code, special rules apply to companies that belong to French
tax consolidated groups (int´egration fiscale). The 25% add-back is factored on the basis of the group’s
consolidated taxable result and applies to the adjusted aggregated net financial charges incurred by
companies that are members of the French tax consolidated group (int´egration fiscale) with respect to
amounts made available by lenders outside such group, to the extent that the tax group companies’
aggregated net financial charges are at least equal to e3.0 million in a given fiscal year.

Finally, for fiscal years ending on or after September 25, 2013, the deductibility of interest paid to a
related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is subject to a new limitation
pursuant to Article 22 of the French Finance Law for 2014. Interest deduction is subject to an additional
requirement: if the lender is a related party to the borrower within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the
French Tax Code, the borrower must now demonstrate, at the French tax authorities’ request, that the
lender is, for the current fiscal year and with respect to the interest concerned, subject to an income tax in
an amount at least equal to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax
rules. Where the related party lender is domiciled or established outside France, the corporate income
tax determined under standard French tax rules shall mean that to which it would have been liable in
France on the interest received if it had been domiciled or established in France. Specific rules apply
where the lender is a pass-through entity for French tax purposes, a collective investment scheme
referred to in Articles L. 214-1 to L. 214-191 of the French Monetary and financial code (which includes
UCITSs and AIFs as well as other collective investment schemes such as SICAVs and SPPICAVs with a
single shareholder) or, subject to certain conditions, a similar entity organized under a foreign law.

The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness
incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service
our indebtedness.

**_The Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be declared_**
**_unenforceable against third parties under fraudulent conveyance laws in France._**

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside
insolvency proceedings, the ‘‘action paulienne’’ provisions. The _action paulienne offers creditors_
protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including,
without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person’s or a third
party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other
legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant
person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or
recovery plan (commissaire `a l’ex´ecution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by
any of the creditors of the relevant person outside insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings,
and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without
an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings,
any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the
act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known
that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (`a titre gratuit), in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent
conveyance. See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral
_and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations—France—Fraudulent Conveyance.’’_

**_The insolvency laws of the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany, and the United_**
**_Kingdom and other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and_**
**_may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Sweden, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
event, proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany and
the United Kingdom or other relevant jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex
and more costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be
subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance
that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each
other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental
and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The
application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and
the Notes Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

Under English insolvency law, among other powers, a liquidator or administrator of an English company
could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such
liquidator or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a
transaction at an undervalue or constituted a preference, each as defined in the relevant insolvency laws
and in each case, where the action took place within a specified time period before the insolvency of the
relevant entity.

In France, among other limitations, the granting of new security interests in the Collateral in connection
with the issuance of the Notes create hardening periods for such security interests, where certain
arrangements or dispositions that are made during a specified period, the ‘‘hardening period’’ (p´eriode
_suspecte), preceding the decision commencing judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings may_
be challenged by the receiver in bankruptcy and certain creditors under the applicable rules of
avoidance. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests in the Collateral will run
from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. The Indentures will permit
the security interests in the Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release
and retaking will restart the applicable hardening periods. At each time, if the security interest granted or
recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it.

In addition, in France, insolvency legislation tends to favor the continuation of a business and protection
of employment over the payment of creditors. In the context of insolvency proceedings affecting
creditors, including court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings or
conciliation proceedings (proc´edure de conciliation)), and court-controlled insolvency proceedings
(safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde financi`ere ac´el´er´ee) and reorganization or liquidation proceedings
(redressement ou liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under
the Notes could be limited or suspended.

Finally, under French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by a Guarantor
may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under French law, as the
case may be, in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest.

See ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations’’ with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and its subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and our business is conducted
entirely outside the United States. Substantially all of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer are
non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuer will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York
courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of
process within the United States on these directors and executive officers. In addition, as all the assets of

42


-----

the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of its directors and executive officers are located outside of the
United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.
Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject
to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with the
Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany or the United Kingdom. There is, therefore, doubt
as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws in an action to enforce a
U.S. judgment in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany or the United Kingdom. In
addition, the enforcement in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany or the United
Kingdom of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a
court in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany or the United Kingdom would have the
requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany or the United Kingdom on the basis of U.S. federal securities
laws violations. See ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.’’

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for
any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the Group’s ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a
rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and a rating of BBB or better by S&P and no default or event of
default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time, if any, at
which such Notes cease to have such ratings, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such
Notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants When Notes Rated
_Investment Grade.’’ If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, the Group would be able to incur_
additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the
interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or Holders of Notes. The nominee of the common
depository for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes.
Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes
representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, which will
make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to
participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and
credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal
or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book entry interest in
the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if you are not a participant
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

43


-----

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights
to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book entry
interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that
the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the
timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and value._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be
offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject
to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state
or any other jurisdiction. The Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to ‘‘qualified
institutional buyers’’ in accordance with Rule 144A. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ We have not agreed to or
otherwise undertaken to register the Notes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(including by way of an exchange offer). It is the obligation of Holders of Notes to ensure that their offers
and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws.

**_Provisions of the EU Savings Directive and other legislation may adversely affect your investment_**
**_in the Notes._**

Under Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States are required to
provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of certain payments of interest or similar
income paid or secured by a person established in a Member State to or for the benefit of an individual
resident in another Member State or certain limited types of entities established in another Member
State.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and
broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these
new requirements from January 1, 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the
Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also
expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member
State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities
or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases
apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the
European Union.

For a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are required (unless during that period they elect
otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above
will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate a
withholding system when they are implemented. In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced
its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from January 1, 2015, in favor of automatic
information exchange under the Directive.

The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating
to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories
including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding
system and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment, no Additional
Amounts would be payable as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. The Issuer is required to
maintain a Paying Agent in a Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the
Directive.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_**
**_may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market in the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes or the
prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Trading prices for the Notes will depend on many
factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for
similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The
liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market
for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market
for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It
is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a
negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.
As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active
trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.
Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF thereof, we cannot assure you that the
Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a
result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting
(whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes, as
applicable, from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a
holder’s ability to resell the Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euros and Swiss francs. If you measure your investment
returns by reference to a currency other than euros or Swiss francs, an investment in the Notes will entail
foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of
the Swiss franc relative to the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your
investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control.
Depreciation of the Swiss franc or the euro against the currency by reference to which you measure the
return on your investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated
coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the
currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. There may be tax
consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from an investment in the
Notes. You should consult your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to you of acquiring,
holding and disposing of the Notes. See ‘‘Tax Considerations.’’

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange._**

Pursuant to the Indenture, the Issuer will agree to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange within a reasonable period after the Issue Date and to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding. However, the Issuer cannot assure you that
the Notes will become, or remain, listed. If the Issuer can no longer maintain the listing on the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the admission to trading on the Euro MTF of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may
cease to make or maintain such listing, provided that it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and
maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that it
will be able to do so. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing
on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for
comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of
the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or another listing exchange in
accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in
the secondary market.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND**
**RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

_The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for_
_the years ended September 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and as of and for the six months ended March 31,_
_2013 and 2014, as derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim Consolidated_
_Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, and our internal accounting_
_system._

_You should read this discussion in conjunction with the sections entitled ‘‘Presentation of Financial_
_Information and Other Data’’, ‘‘Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information’’ and_
_‘‘Capitalization’’, which are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. This discussion includes_
_forward-looking statements, which although based on assumptions that we consider reasonable, are_
_subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or conditions to differ materially from_
_those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’_
_and, for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties which we face, ‘‘Risk Factors.’’_

**Overview**

We are the leading independent operator of vending machines in Europe by revenue, with operations in
21 countries across Europe and leading market shares in our key markets of Switzerland, Sweden and
France. We operate a network of approximately 135,000 active snack and beverage vending machines
on behalf of a broad and diverse client base. We offer a wide range of products in our vending machines,
including hot and cold beverages and various snacks and confectionary items. Our clients include a
large number of both private and public organizations. Our private vending services, which also include
our office coffee services (‘‘OCS’’), are directed primarily at office environments but also include clients
such as hospitals and universities. Our public vending machines are located in high-traffic public
locations, such as airports, train and subway stations and gas stations, where our longer-term client
contracts provide us with a steady stream of revenue. In addition to our public and private vending
operations, we also generate revenue from trade sales of machines and products.

For the year ended September 30, 2013, revenue from our privately placed points of sale, which includes
OCS, accounted for 63.0% of our total revenue. Revenue from OCS alone corresponded to 9.6% of our
total revenue for the same period. For the same period, revenue from our public vending clients, or our
publicly accessible points of sale, accounted for 24.7% of our total revenue. Other revenue and revenue
from trade sales of machines and products accounted for 12.3% of our total revenue for the year ended
September 30, 2013. By product mix, vends of hot drinks accounted for 51.7% of our total revenue for
the year ended September 30, 2013, while vends of snacks and cold drinks accounted for 35.4% of our
total revenue.

Our business model covers the full value chain of the vending services market. Our sales teams originate
new contracts for the placement of vending machines on clients’ premises, and we also bid for
concessions pursuant to public tenders to place vending machines with public entities, such as airports
and train and subway stations. We purchase vending machines for our clients, install them at their
premises and manage the sourcing and stocking of the food and beverage vending products on behalf
of our clients. We also provide cleaning, maintenance and technical support services, which can be
customized based on individual client preferences. In addition to our vending and vending services
operations, we also sell vending machines, vending machine parts and products separately and
independent of vending service arrangements. We therefore generate revenue at each step of the
vending services value chain, through a combination of fees from clients for providing, stocking and
maintaining vending machines, through the products sold from our vending machines and from the sale
of machines, ingredients and spare parts.

We operate our vending machine network primarily under the ‘‘Selecta’’ brand, which we believe stands
for quality and innovation in the industry and enjoys strong brand recognition in many of the markets in
which we operate. We are active across much of Western Europe. For the twelve months ended
March 31, 2014, our vending machine operations in our Central and North regions accounted for 40.8%
and 21.4% of our total revenue, respectively, with France and the United Kingdom contributing 27.8%
and 10.0% of our total revenue, respectively. In terms of market share by revenue, we believe that we
have market shares of approximately 49%, 40% and 11% in Switzerland, Sweden and France,
respectively, based on market size data from the European Vending Association for 2012 and our own

50


-----

estimates. We are also the overall market leader by revenue in the total European vending market, with
an estimated market share of approximately 7% based on the same market data and estimates.

The European vending machine market is fragmented and characterized by a large number of small
scale vending machine operators. We believe that our business model and our scale provide us with
competitive advantages compared to smaller vending machine operators and present us with
opportunities to benefit from market consolidation in the future. Moreover, as one of the only vending
machine operators with a pan-European platform, we are better positioned than many of our
competitors to provide vending services to large multinational clients present in multiple European
countries.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated revenue of e715.0 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of e135.6 million. For the same period, our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.0%.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operation are affected by a combination of factors, including factors which are beyond our
control. We believe that our results of operations, and particularly the results of operation during the
periods under review, have been primarily affected by the following factors.

**_General economic conditions and consumer spending_**

Demand for our vending machines and vending products is affected by general economic conditions
and consumer spending. Changes in general economic conditions directly impact consumer spending
as well as the investment levels of our clients in non-essential services, such as vending machines and
services. For the year ended September 30, 2013, we derived 63.0% of our revenue from privately
placed points of sale. As vending machines in such privately placed points of sale are generally located
in companies and office environments, as well as in hospitals, universities and similar locations,
macroeconomic factors such as GDP and employment levels, among others, affect the number of items
sold through these machines. For example, reductions in workforce levels or hours worked during
recessionary periods (including the effects of reduced overtime, layoffs and increased reliance on
part-time versus full-time workers) means that our vending machines in companies and office
environments are available to fewer consumers and/or consumers with less purchasing power.
Moreover, recessionary conditions may adversely impact our ability to generate new business if
companies invest less in non-essential services, such as the decision to contract for the placement of a
vending machine on their premises. In our public vending operations, declines in consumer spending or
consumer purchasing power can also negatively affect our revenue generated from our vending
machines in public locations. In general, however, our public vending operations are less impacted by
macroeconomic conditions than our private vending operations.

Certain of the countries in which we operate, such as France and Spain, have experienced recessionary
economic environments and significantly elevated levels of unemployment in recent years, which have
contributed to a decline in our revenue generated in those countries. However, our pan-European
footprint, including strong market positions in countries such as Switzerland, Sweden and Germany,
which have been less affected by the European sovereign debt crisis, has helped to limit the impact on
our revenue and margins. Furthermore, we have implemented certain reorganization measures to
reduce our direct and indirect overhead costs, particularly related to our workforce and costs related to
our headquarters’ functions. In addition, we have also implemented certain procurement initiatives such
as bundling volumes of supplies, focusing on selected suppliers and streamlining our supply chain. Our
total revenue decreased from e800.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e740.2 million for
the year ended September 30, 2013, in part as a result of the challenging economic environments in
many of our markets. Over the same period, however, we have managed to increase our Adjusted
EBITDA margin from 15.0% for the year ended September 30, 2011 to 17.9% for the year ended
September 30, 2013.

**_Capital expenditure and related cost control initiatives_**

We operate the network of vending machines we place on our clients’ premises, which means that we
need to purchase new machines and refurbish existing vending machines in the ordinary course of
business. A significant portion of our capital expenditures relates to the purchase of new vending
machines and refurbishment of our existing vending machines. From 2011 to 2013, we reduced our
capital expenditure in line with lower revenue levels and our total capital expenditure decreased from

51


-----

e72.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e44.9 million for the year ended September 30,
2013. Over the same period, our total net capital expenditure decreased from e67.8 million for the year
ended September 30, 2011 to e37.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. In order to reduce
capital expenditures from 2011 to 2013, we (i) de-installed approximately 2,800 unprofitable vending
machines in the United Kingdom as part of a restructuring of our UK business and used those machines
which were in a reusable condition both in the United Kingdom and in other markets, (ii) extended the life
cycle of our vending machines by relocating machines which had reached the end of their life cycle in
certain Western and Northern European countries to markets where older machines can be effectively
utilized, in particular in the Baltic countries and Eastern Europe, (iii) implemented a vending machine
stock optimization program across our Group to provide greater visibility of machine availability across
the Group and allow machines to be sourced and refurbished within the Group, thereby reducing the
need to purchase new vending machines, and (iv) introduced stricter investment thresholds related to
the purchase of new vending machines and equipment in order to reduce the risk of unprofitable
contracts. Although we significantly reduced our capital expenditures from 2011 to 2013, we expect that
our capital expenditures related to the purchase of new vending machines increase in the future to
support the investment required to deliver new business growth and maintain the existing vending
machine park. Based on a vending machine park gross asset value (at cost) of e543.2 million as of
September 30, 2013 and an estimated average asset life of 10 years for our active vending machines
after refurbishment, we estimate that we will require capital expenditures of approximately e54 million
per year on vending machines to support our current level of revenue in addition to capital expenditure
for vehicles, IT and other equipment. We further estimate we will require approximately e3 million of
capital expenditure per year to support each additional per cent of revenue growth. Our estimates with
respect to such future capital expenditure requirements may vary based on changes in our product,
concept and segment mix.

As our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on different capital intensity in
different business segments, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to new business, levels of
capital expenditure funded through new machines versus refurbished machines and specific initiatives
to develop telemetry and cashless payment technologies, among other factors, we cannot assure you
that our level of capital expenditure will not increase significantly in the future. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to our Business—Our business requires capital expenditures which may divert significant cash_
_flow from other investments or uses, including debt servicing.’’_

**_Clients_**

We believe that we have stable relationships with our clients, some of which are longstanding clients. In
addition, our client base is highly fragmented, which limits our dependence on any single client. For the
year ended September 30, 2013, our top ten clients accounted for approximately 18% of our total
revenue and our largest client by revenue accounted for 3.8% of our total revenue. Nevertheless, the
gain or loss of significant clients affects our results of operations, and net client growth and retention
were both adversely impacted in recent years. For example, we were not successful in our re-tender for
Total in Germany in the year ended September 30, 2013 and Paresto in the Netherlands in the year
ended September 30, 2012, which together accounted for approximately 2,400 vending machines.
Together with our de-installation of approximately 2,800 vending machines from the United Kingdom in
2013 and other factors, these client losses contributed to the decrease in revenue from e792.3 million for
the year ended September 30, 2012 to e740.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2013, which
could only be partly offset by the approximately 850 vending machines added to our vending machine
park through our top ten new clients gained in 2013. More recently, in March 2014, we extended a large
contract to provide Soci´et´e Nationale des Chemins de fer Fran¸cais (‘‘SNCF’’) with public vending
services in many of its large railways stations. Beginning in September 2014, we will replace our current
machines and expand our service with the installation of 2,150 new and refurbished vending machines in
over 800 stations of SNCF’s network.

**_Vending machine density and concept and product mix_**

Our results of operations and profit before interest and income tax are affected by a combination of
factors, including the number of vending machines in a given area, the type of vending machine, the
product mix in our vending machines and the level of vending services we provide. In both private and
public vending, vending machine density is one of the primary drivers of profitability. Vending machines
which are closer together can be more quickly and efficiently managed by the same personnel, which

52


-----

reduces transport time and the relative costs associated with personnel, restocking, fuel and
maintenance. In contrast, single machines in isolated locations may not generate sufficient gross profit
to cover the costs of visits to restock or perform scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.

Our revenue and margins are also driven by our mix of private and public vending, products and prices.
Private vending is our largest vending concept by revenue and is primarily driven by sales of coffee and
other hot beverages. Private vending margins vary based on the type of vending machines located in a
particular area as well as the extent to which a client agrees to subsidize the cost of vending products for
its employees. Consumers generally consume more products and beverages when the cost is
subsidized by their employers, leading to larger volumes of vends and higher margins. Public vending
margins vary primarily based on the combination of the volume of vends and the price points for the
products sold, which depend on the locations of the vending machines and the number of other
locations in close proximity to our vending machines which sell the same or similar products, as well as
the level of vending rent paid to the client. Therefore, the combination of location, machine density,
product mix, prices and contributions paid to the client are among the key factors which determine
profitability of our vending machines.

**_Prices of vending stock and procurement initiatives_**

Prices of certain commodities, such as green bean coffee, cocoa and sugar, affect our cost of materials.
Among other things, for our private label coffee brands, we estimate we require approximately 2,400
tons of Arabica green bean coffee and approximately 1,000 tons of Robusta green bean coffee to
regularly stock our hot drinks vending machines or supply our clients with coffee beans. Prices for green
bean coffee have fluctuated significantly in recent years. For example, the price of Arabica coffee, which
we use for the supply of our own miofino coffee blends, increased by more than 100% from March 2010
to May 2011, before decreasing by approximately 60% in 2012 and 30% in 2013, with prices ranging
from US$3.10 per pound in April 2011 to US$1.10 per pound in November 2013 (based on the ICE ‘C’
New York index). In order to manage risks from fluctuations in commodities prices, we secure the green
bean requirements for our private label coffee for periods of up to six months by instructing the relevant
supplier to source the required green beans to cover certain production lots at a specific price. With
certain strategic suppliers, we enter into longer-term agreements with agreed price adjustment
mechanisms that reflect developments in commodity prices.

We recently implemented certain procurement initiatives, such as the bundling of volumes to take
advantage of economies of scale and an increased focus on selected suppliers to streamline our supply
chain. We are in the process of strengthening our corporate procurement department to make it
responsible for more of the products and vending stock we source, and we recently renegotiated a
number of our more significant supply agreements to lower the cost of some of our supplies. While
certain vending products, such as confectionary items, and other vending stock items which cater to
local or regional tastes continue to be sourced on a country level, we now source our private label green
bean coffee as well as cups, sugar and stirrers, among other supplies, through our corporate
procurement department, which allows us to secure more competitive pricing based on larger volume
orders.

**_Disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A._**

On February 29, 2012, we disposed of 100% of the shares of Selecta Italia S.p.A. for total cash
consideration of e7.5 million. At the date of disposal, Selecta Italia S.p.A.’s total assets amounted to
e15.0 million and total liabilities, including estimated provisions for certain expected post-completion
contingent liabilities, amounted to e8.2 million, resulting in a net disposal gain of e0.7 million as reported
in the year ended September 30, 2012. The actual amounts for which these liabilities were subsequently
settled were lower than expected. Therefore, an additional disposal gain of e0.2 million was recognized
in the year ended September 30, 2013. See note 35 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details. Since our disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A., we are no longer active in the Italian vending machine
market.

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased by e25.2 million, or 6.7%, from e374.2 million for the six months ended March 31,
2013 to e349.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily
due to the following factors. In Germany we were unsuccessful in our re-tender to provide vending
services to Total in Germany and de-installed those machines between July and September 2013. In
addition, we executed the managed de-installation of approximately 2,800 unprofitable vending
machines in the United Kingdom throughout the first half of the year ended September 30, 2013. Same
machine sales were lower in the six months ended March 31, 2014 than the equivalent six month period
in the prior year due to a weaker macroeconomic environment and lower investments in new machines,
particularly in our Central region, although same machine sales show signs of stabilizing in some of our
markets in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014, in particular in our Central and North regions.

The table below shows our total sales by region for the six months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014,
respectively:

**For the six months ended March 31,**

Revenue in our Central region decreased by e9.8 million, or 6.4%, from e152.6 million for the six months
ended March 31, 2013 to e142.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease was
primarily due to the unsuccessful re-tender to provide vending services to Total in Germany, with the
machines being de-installed between July and September 2013.

Revenue in our North region decreased by e5.6 million, or 6.7%, from e84.2 million for the six months
ended March 31, 2013 to e78.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease was
primarily due to weaker same machine sales as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment. While
unemployment has been generally stable in our North region countries, the lower consumption was
evident in larger industrial sites where we are present, and was also impacted by reduced shifts, less
overtime hours and fewer consultants at our client sites.

Revenue in France decreased by e4.8 million, or 4.9%, from e97.4 million for the six months ended
March 31, 2013 to e92.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily
due to lower revenue from private vending as a result of weaker same machine sales due to a weaker
macroeconomic environment as well as lower public vending sales, driven in part by our decision to
postpone investments in our railway business pending the outcome of the SNCF tender which we
successfully won in March 2014. In addition, reduced trade sales of product ingredients in France
contributed to the decrease in the six months ended 31 March 2014.

Revenue in our United Kingdom region decreased by e5.1 million, or 12.7%, from e40.1 million for the six
months ended March 31, 2013 to e35.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease
was due to our de-installation of approximately 2,800 unprofitable machines from client sites and
reorganization measures in our United Kingdom operations to return the region to profitability.

_Materials and consumables used_

Materials and consumables used decreased by e6.3 million, or 5.4%, from e116.0 million for the six
months ended March 31, 2013 to e109.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease
in materials and consumables used was primarily driven by the overall decline in revenue. As a
percentage of revenue, materials and consumables used increased from 31.0% for the six months
ended March 31, 2013 to 31.4% for the six months ended March 31, 2014, due to changes in the
business mix and, in particular, the unsuccessful re-tender for the Total contract in Germany as well as
increasing green bean coffee prices.

_Employee benefits expense_

Employee benefits expense decreased by e9.2 million, or 7.7%, from e119.6 million for the six months
ended March 31, 2013 to e110.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease in
employee benefits expense was primarily due to a decrease of e8.1 million in wages and salaries from
e89.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to e81.5 million for the six months ended
March 31, 2014, driven by a reduction in the number of full time employees resulting from various
reorganization programs implemented across the Group, in particular the corresponding headcount
reduction in the United Kingdom in connection with the de-installation of approximately 2,800
unprofitable machines from client sites and the unsuccessful re-tender for the Total contract in Germany.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense_

Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense decreased by e4.1 million, or 8.8%, from
e46.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to e42.6 million for the six months ended
March 31, 2014. The decrease in depreciation, amortization and impairment was primarily due to
depreciation of property, plant and equipment which decreased by e3.2 million from e33.0 million for the
six months ended March 31, 2013 to e29.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014 as a result of
a decrease in property, plant and equipment additions.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses decreased by e12.9 million, or 14.7%, from e87.6 million for the six months
ended March 31, 2013 to e74.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. The decrease in other
operating expenses was primarily due to lower vending rent, which decreased by e7.3 million from
e42.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to e35.6 million for the six months ended
March 31, 2014 as a result of the unsuccessful re-tender for the Total contract in Germany which carried
a high level of vending rent.

_Finance income and costs_

Finance income and costs amounted to a net cost of e15.6 million for the six months ended March 31,
2014, an increase of e2.6 million, from a net cost of e13.0 million for the six months ended March 31,
2013. The increase in finance costs was primarily driven by our net foreign exchange gain/(loss), which
decreased from a gain of e3.2 million during the six months ended March 31, 2013 to a loss of
e0.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014.

_Income taxes_

Income tax expense amounted to e0.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014, an increase of
e0.3 million, or 75.0%, from e0.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013. The increase was due
to an increase in both current income taxes and deferred income taxes. Current income taxes increased
by e0.1 million from e1.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to e1.6 million for the six
months ended March 31, 2014 while the gain from deferred income taxes decreased by e0.1 million from
a gain of e1.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to a gain of e1.0 million for the six months
ended March 31, 2014.

_Net profit (loss) for the period_

Net loss amounted to e4.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014, a decrease of e4.4 million, or
48.4%, from e9.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease was principally due to
the factors discussed above.

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased by e52.1 million, or 6.6%, from e792.3 million for the year ended September 30,
2012 to e740.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in revenue was driven by
several factors. Same machine sales were lower in 2013 than the prior year due to a weaker
macroeconomic environment and lower investments in new machines, particularly in our Central region.
In addition, we executed the managed de-installation of approximately 2,800 unprofitable vending
machines in the United Kingdom. Trade sales of machines and products were also lower in 2013 than
2012, decreasing from e69.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e58.7 million for the year
ended September 30, 2013, due to clients postponing investments in non-essential services. Unlike our
full and partial vending service concepts, trade sales of machines and products are not linked to
contractual commitments with clients and amounts of such sales can therefore fluctuate significantly
from period to period.

The table below shows our total sales by region for the year ended September 30, 2012 and 2013,
respectively:

**For the year ended September 30,**

**2012** **2013** **% change**
**(g in thousands, except**

Revenue in our Central region decreased by e12.3 million, or 3.9%, from e313.9 million for the year
ended September 30, 2012 to e301.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease was
primarily due to lower revenue from private vending, a result of weaker same machine sales driven by a
weaker macroeconomic environment and reduced investment in capital expenditures. In addition,
reduced trade machine sales in our Central region, due to clients postponing investments in
non-essential services, contributed to the decrease.

Revenue in our North region decreased by e12.2 million, or 7.2%, from e170.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2012 to e158.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease was evident
across all business concepts and included the unsuccessful re-tender to provide vending services to
Paresto, a large client in the Netherlands, towards the end of 2012, which contributed to lower sales in
the year, and weaker same machine sales. The decrease was also due to weaker trade machine sales
due to clients postponing investments in non-essential services.

Revenue in France decreased by e10.1 million, or 4.7%, from e213.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 2012 to e203.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease was
primarily due to lower revenue from private vending as a result of weaker same machine sales due to a
weaker macroeconomic environment. In addition, reduced trade sales of product ingredients in France
contributed to the decrease in 2013.

Revenue in our United Kingdom region decreased by e17.5 million, or 18.6%, from e94.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 2012 to e76.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease
was due to our de-installation of approximately 2,800 unprofitable machines from client sites and
restructuring measures in our United Kingdom operations to return the region to profitability.

_Materials and consumables used_

Expenses for materials and consumables used decreased by e25.9 million, or 10.3%, from
e251.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e225.3 million for the year ended
September 30, 2013. The decrease in materials and consumables used was primarily driven by the
overall decline in revenue. As a percentage of revenue, materials and consumables used decreased
from 31.7% for the year ended September 30, 2012 to 30.4% for the year ended September 30, 2013 due
to changes in the business mix as well as lower green bean coffee prices compared to the prior year.

_Employee benefits expense_

Employee benefits expense decreased by e11.4 million, or 4.8%, from e236.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2012 to e225.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in
employee benefits expense was due to a decrease of e4.2 million in wages and salaries from
e188.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e184.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 2013, driven by a reduction in the number of full time employees resulting from various
restructuring programs implemented across the Group, in particular the corresponding headcount
reduction in the United Kingdom in connection with the de-installation of approximately
2,800 unprofitable machines from client sites. In addition, employee benefits expense was positively
impacted by a decrease of e3.6 million in post-employment benefits, from e5.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2012 to e1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2013, as a result of a one-time
e4.8 million curtailment of retirement benefits in our Swiss pension scheme. See note 22 of our
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on retirement benefit obligations.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense_

Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense decreased by e2.6 million, or 2.7%, from
e97.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e95.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2013. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment decreased by e5.6 million from e71.0 million for the
year ended September 30, 2012 to e65.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2013 due to a
decrease in property, plant and equipment additions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in
impairment of intangible assets, which rose from e0.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to
e3.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2013, related primarily to the impairment of a procurement
system which had been developed in previous years but was deemed not to be suitable for the Group’s
requirements.

_Gain on disposal of subsidiary_

Gain on disposals of subsidiaries decreased by e0.5 million, or 71.4%, from e0.7 million for the year
ended September 30, 2012 to e0.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The gain of
e0.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 related to the disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A. in
February 2012 and reflected the estimated net gain on the disposal. The gain of e0.2 million for the year
ended September 30, 2013 represented the additional gain following finalization of the provisional
estimated in the prior year.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses remained largely unchanged from the prior year, decreasing by e1.1 million,
or 0.6%, from e176.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e175.1 million for the year ended
September 30, 2013.

_Finance income and costs_

Finance income and costs amounted to a net cost of e27.9 million for the year ended September 30,
2013, a decrease of e10.8 million from a net cost of e38.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2012.
Finance costs decreased by e10.7 million from e38.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to
e28.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. The decrease was due to a net foreign exchange
gain of e4.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2013 compared to a net foreign exchange loss of
e5.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2012. In addition, interest on bank loans decreased by
e17.5 million from e49.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e32.4 million for the year
ended September 30, 2013 after our interest rate swaps expired on June 30, 2012, resulting in a
significant decrease in the interest rate payable on the Group’s borrowings. This decrease was, however,
offset by a change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps until their expiry in the amount of
e16.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, thereby limiting the net impact on finance costs to
e0.8 million.

_Income taxes_

Income tax income amounted to e8.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2013, an increase of
e8.0 million from e0.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in deferred tax income from e4.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2012 to e13.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2013 due to an increase in the amount of tax
losses recognized as deferred tax assets.

_Net profit (loss) for the period_

Net profit amounted to e0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2013, an increase from a net loss of
e6.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was principally due to the factors
discussed above.

_Revenue_

Revenue decreased by e8.1 million, or 1.0%, from e800.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2011
to e792.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. While revenue remained relatively flat between
2011 and 2012, there were a number of offsetting factors in the underlying revenue development. In
February 2012, we disposed of Selecta Italia S.p.A., which resulted in a decrease in revenue in our
Central region and was only partially offset by an increase in revenue from public vending in that region.
Revenue increased in our North region due to improved same machine sales in private vending and
increased revenue from trade sales of machines and products. Revenue was lower in our UK region, due

59


-----

to weaker sales of snacks and cold drinks, as well as in France, where we were not awarded the
re-tender for three large clients in the first quarter of 2012.

The table below shows our total sales by region for the year ended September 30, 2011 and 2012,
respectively:

**For the year ended September 30,**

Revenue in our Central region decreased by e2.2 million, or 0.7%, from e316.1 million for the year ended
September 30, 2011 to e313.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The decrease was
primarily attributable to the disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A., which resulted in a decrease in revenue of
e6.6 million from e9.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e3.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2012. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from public vending in other
countries of the region, driven by strong sales in petrol stations as well as improved same machine sales.

Revenue in our North region increased by e10.5 million, or 6.6%, from e160.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2011 to e170.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The increase was
primarily attributable to higher revenue generated by our OCS business, driven by improved same
machine sales. In addition, sales of trade machines and products increased in 2012 driven by machine
sales to a large fast food chain.

Revenue in France decreased by e14.9 million, or 6.5%, from e228.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2011 to e213.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The decrease was driven
by the loss of, or failure to be awarded the re-tender for, three clients in the first quarter of the year ended
September 30, 2012, AGIP and Carrefour petrol station chains in public vending and Decathlon in private
vending, as well as by lower same machine sales in private vending.

Revenue in our UK region decreased by e1.5 million, or 1.6%, from e95.7 million for the year ended
September 30, 2011 to e94.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2012, primarily attributable to
weaker sales of snacks and cold drinks.

_Materials and consumables used_

Expenses for materials and consumables used decreased by e3.5 million, or 1.4%, from e254.7 million
for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e251.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The
decrease in expense for materials and consumables used was primarily due to a decline in cost of
materials from e276.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e268.7 million for the year ended
September 30, 2012 in line with the lower revenue compared to the prior year.

As a percentage of revenue, materials and consumables was largely unchanged at 31.7% for the year
ended September 30, 2012 compared to 31.8% for the year ended September 30, 2011.

_Employee benefits expense_

Employee benefits expense decreased by e3.0 million, or 1.3%, from e239.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2011 to e236.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The decrease in
employee benefits expense was primarily due to the disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A. Employee benefits
expense in Selecta Italia S.p.A was e3.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2011, while for the
period up to the disposal in 2012 employee benefits expense in Select Italia S.p.A. amounted to
e0.8 million, a decrease of e2.5 million.

_Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense_

Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense decreased by e4.7 million, or 4.6%, from
e102.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e97.8 million for the year ended September 30,
2012. The decrease in depreciation, amortization and impairment was primarily due to a decrease in
property, plant and equipment additions, which resulted in a decrease in depreciation of property, plant
and equipment of e4.6 million from e75.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e71.0 million
for the year ended September 30, 2012.

_Gain on disposal of subsidiary_

Gain on disposal of subsidiary amounted to e0.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2012, and
represents the estimated profit on the disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A in February 2012. We did not record
any gain on disposals of subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2011. See note 35 of our
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the assets and liabilities disposed of in
connection with the disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A.

_Other operating expenses_

Other operating expenses decreased by e13.1 million, or 6.9%, from e189.3 million for the year ended
September 30, 2011 to e176.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The decrease in other
operating expenses was due to several factors. Vending rents decreased by e3.4 million from
e82.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e79.3 million for the year ended September 30,
2012 primarily due to the impact of the loss of the AGIP and Carrefour petrol station business in France.
In addition, the decrease was the result of a significant change in other operating income and expenses,
from an expense of e6.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to a gain of e2.3 million for the
year ended September 30, 2012. This was primarily due to a decrease in provisions for litigation in
France of e3.8 million from the year ended September 30, 2011 to the year ended September 30, 2012
relating predominantly to a provision for under declared VAT relating to previous years, as well as a
decrease in the amount of non-profit related tax from e2.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2011
to e1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. In addition, for the year ended September 30,
2012, we recorded non-recurring income of e0.7 million from a machine supplier as compensation for
the costs of switching production to the supplier.

_Finance income and costs_

Finance income and costs amounted to a net cost of e38.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2012, an increase of e6.3 million, from a net cost of e32.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2011.
The increase in total finance costs from e32.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to
e38.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 was primarily driven by net foreign exchange
losses of e5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 compared to a net foreign exchange gain
of e2.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. This was partially offset by a decrease of
e2.5 million in interest on bank loans, from e52.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to
e49.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012, as a result of the lower interest charges in the
fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2012, subsequent to the expiry of our interest rate swaps
on June 30, 2012.

_Income taxes_

Income tax income amounted to e0.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of
e2.5 million, or 78.1%, from e3.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was
primarily attributable to lower profit before tax and was only partially offset by the impact of a reduction in
the amount of expenses not allowable for tax purposes.

_Net profit (loss) for the period_

Net loss amounted to e6.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2012, an improvement of
e8.2 million, or 55.4%, from a net loss of e14.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. This
decrease in net loss for the period was principally due to the factors discussed above.

**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

We define EBITDA as profit before interest and income tax and depreciation, amortization and
impairment expense. Our management uses EBITDA for internal management purposes. In addition,
under our Existing Credit Facilities, we have had to comply with covenants related to performance
indicators based on EBITDA. The Revolving Credit Facility will also contain a performance covenant
based on EBITDA.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as profit before interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization and
impairment and one-off items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance
under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.
Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this offering memorandum, may differ from, and may not be
comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. We present Adjusted EBITDA
because we believe it is helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to
service our debt. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA
as presented herein differs from Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes. See
‘‘Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data.’’

(b) These items represent restructuring and redundancy costs relating to headcount reductions and senior management
changes. For the year ended September 30, 2013, this item includes restructuring and redundancy costs relating to
headcount reductions in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Switzerland and our headquarters.

(c) This item relates to a profit on the sale of non-trading assets in France (e1.4 million) and a profit related to the sale of a
subsidiary booked at our headquarters (e0.7 million).

(d) For the year ended September 30, 2012, this item includes adjustments related to one-off project expenses (e3.7 million) and
other non-recurring items (e0.4 million). For the year ended September 30, 2013, this item includes adjustments related
primarily to one-off project expenses (e2.3 million) and other non-recurring items (e0.7 million). For the six months ended
March 31, 2013, this item includes one-off project expenses (e1.3 million). For the six months ended March 31, 2014, this
item includes one-off project expenses (e2.2 million), most of which were recorded at our headquarters in Switzerland, and
other project expenses (e1.0 million) which were mostly recorded in our North region.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our principal sources of funds have been cash generated from our operating activities and borrowings
under the Existing Credit Facilities. Our principal uses of cash are to fund debt service obligations,
working capital and capital expenditures. As of March 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of
e91.0 million.

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows. Our
ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn, depends to some

62


-----

extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
See ‘‘Risk Factors.’’

In addition, we will have access to the Revolving Credit Facility to service our working capital and general
corporate needs. The continued availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon certain
conditions, including ongoing compliance with a maintenance covenant tested quarterly as described
further under ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility.’’

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service
needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating
activities or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay
our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

**Working Capital**

The table below sets forth a summary of movements in our working capital for the periods indicated,

(1) Unaudited.

Cash outflows from movements in working capital amounted to e9.0 million in the six months ended
March 31, 2014. Cash outflow from decreases in other liabilities amounted to e6.4 million and was
primarily due to an increase in prepayments to suppliers. Cash outflow of e4.9 million from increases in
trade receivables was primarily due to payments of vending rents.

Cash inflows from movements in working capital amounted to e2.3 million in the year ended
September 30, 2013. Cash inflow from decreases in trade receivables amounted to e2.2 million and was
in line with the decrease in revenue in 2013. Cash inflow from decreases in other current assets
amounted to e1.8 million and was primarily attributable to a decrease in uncollected cash in the vending
machines from e13.3 million at September 30, 2012 to e10.1 million at September 30, 2013, due to the
decline in revenue as well as timing of cash collections around the year end. Cash outflow of e8.6 million
from decreases in trade payables and cash inflows of e7.7 million from increases in other liabilities
largely offset one another, resulting in a net cash outflow of e0.9 million from increases in payables and
other liabilities.

Cash outflows from movements in working capital amounted to e4.7 million in the year ended
September 30, 2012. Cash outflow from decreases in other liabilities amounted to e18.6 million and was
primarily due to the reduction of e3.8 million in provisions for litigation in France, related to a release of a
provision for under declared VAT booked in 2011, and a decrease in our warranty provision in France of
e2.4 million during 2012 subsequent to signing a new client contract. Cash inflow of e6.4 million from
decreases in inventories was primarily due to a reduction of e4.3 million in the amount of vending
machine inventory in the year resulting from capital efficiency measures and the more effective utilization
of our machine park.

Cash inflows from movements in working capital amounted to e28.9 million in the year ended
September 30, 2011. Cash inflow from increases in trade payables amounted to e10.4 million, primarily
the result of our efforts to lengthen payment terms with suppliers and maximize flexibility in payments to
suppliers. Cash inflow from increases in other liabilities amounted to e12.7 million, primarily due to

63


-----

an increase of e4.8 million in provisions for litigation in France in the year ended September 30, 2011
relating predominantly to a provision for under declared VAT from previous years as well as an increase
of e2.2 million in accruals related to increased bonus accruals compared to 2010. Cash inflow of
e8.1 million from decreases in trade receivables and cash outflow of e5.0 million from increases in other
current assets were largely attributable to a reclassification of cash held with counting companies in
France from accounts receivable to accrued income. Cash inflow of e2.8 million from decreases in
inventories was driven by a decrease of e0.7 million in food and beverages inventory and a decrease of
e0.7 million in machine inventories during the year ended September 30, 2011.

**_Cash flows from operating activities_**

_Comparison of the six months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014_

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by e4.8 million from e34.3 million for the six months
ended March 31, 2013 to e39.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. This increase was
primarily attributable to a decrease in the net cash outflow from movements in working capital of
e5.4 million from e14.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to e9.0 million for the six months
ended March 31, 2014.

_Comparison of the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2013_

Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by e7.1 million, or 6.0%, from e118.0 million for the
year ended September 30, 2012 to e110.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease
was primarily attributable to a decrease in profit before interest and income tax of e11.7 million from
e31.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e19.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2013. The decrease was also due to an increase of e2.1 million in income taxes paid from e2.1 million for
the year ended September 30, 2012 to e4.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2013, offset by
changes in working capital. Cash outflow from movements in working capital was e4.7 million in the year
ended September 30, 2012 compared to cash inflows of e2.3 million in the year ended September 30,
2013, as described above.

_Comparison of the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2012_

Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by e22.3 million, or 15.9%, from e140.3 million for the
year ended September 30, 2011 to e118.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. This decrease
was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash from changes in working capital in the amount of
e33.6 million. Cash inflow from movements in working capital was e28.9 million in the year ended
September 30, 2011 compared to cash outflow of e4.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2012, as
described above. The decrease due to the cash impact of changes in working capital was offset by an
increase of e17.0 million in profit before interest and income tax from e14.4 million for the year ended
September 30, 2011 to e31.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2012.

**_Cash flows used in investing activities_**

_Comparison of the six months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by e4.3 million, or 24.7%, from e17.4 million for the six
months ended March 31, 2013 to e21.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. This increase
was primarily attributable to an increase of e6.0 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment
from e19.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to e25.3 million for the six months ended
March 31, 2014 and was partly offset by an increase of e1.6 million in cash proceeds from sale of
property, plant and equipment from e3.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2013 to e4.6 million
for the six months ended March 31, 2014.

_Comparison of the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2013_

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by e1.7 million, or 4.6%, from e37.1 million for the year
ended September 30, 2012 to e35.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease was
primarily attributable to lower cash outflows for purchases of property, plant and equipment, which
declined from e48.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e40.4 million for the year ended
September 30, 2013 as a result of reduced investment in vending machines and vending equipment.
The decrease was partially offset by e7.2 million in proceeds from the disposal of Selecta Italia S.p.A. in
2012, compared to no such proceeds received from sales of subsidiaries in 2013, as a decrease in
proceeds from assets disposals from e9.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 to e7.0 million
for the year ended September 30, 2013.

_Comparison of the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2012_

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by e31.2 million, or 45.7%, from e68.3 million for the year
ended September 30, 2011 to e37.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. This decrease was
primarily attributable to a significant decline in cash outflows for purchases of property, plant and
equipment, which decreased from e67.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e48.3 million
for the year ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to lower capital expenditures related to vending
machines and vending equipment. The decrease was also due to proceeds from the sale of Selecta
Italia S.p.A. in February 2012 in the amount of e7.2 million as well as cash proceeds from the disposal of
property, plant and equipment, which increased from e4.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2011 to e9.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2012.

**_Cash flows from financing activities_**

_Comparison of the six months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014_

Net cash used in financing activities increased by e1.4 million, or 6.8%, from e20.5 million for the six
months ended March 31, 2013 to e21.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2014. This increase
was primarily attributable to one more month of interest on our borrowings being paid in cash. In the six
months ended March 31, 2013 we paid cash interest to cover the six months from September 29, 2012 to
February 28, 2013, while in the year ended March 31, 2014 we paid cash interest to cover the seven
month-period from August 29, 2013 to March 28, 2014.

_Comparison of the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2013_

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by e29.8 million, or 42.4%, from e70.3 million for the year
ended September 30, 2012 to e40.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. This decrease was
primarily attributable to a decline in interest paid from e51.1 million for the year ended September 30,
2012 to e22.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2013 due to the expiration of our interest rate
swaps on June 30, 2012, resulting in a significant decrease in the interest rate payable on the Group’s
borrowings.

_Comparison of the years ended September 30, 2011 and 2012_

Net cash used in financing activities increased by e20.4 million, or 40.9%, from e49.9 million for the year
ended September 30, 2011 to e70.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was
primarily attributable to e19.2 million in repayments under our acquisition facility under the Existing
Credit Facilities in the year ended September 30, 2012 compared to a drawing of e13.1 million in 2011. In
addition, interest paid increased from e46.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to

65


-----

e51.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. This increase was partially offset by no payments
on the revolver in the year ended September 30, 2012 compared to e16.3 million in net repayments in
the year ended September 30, 2011.

**Capital expenditures**

Our capital expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013 relate primarily to the
acquisition of vending machines to be installed on our clients’ premises. Our capital expenditures also
related to the purchase of vehicles and other equipment, such as vending furniture, machine
installations (particularly in public vending locations) and IT investments.

The table below sets forth our capital expenditures for the periods presented:

**Six months ended**
**Year ended September 30,** **March 31,**

**2011** **2012** **2013** **2013** **2014**
**(g in thousands)**
**Capital expenditures[(1)]** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **72,262** **53,809** **44,900** **20,477** **29,875**

(1) Unaudited.

Capital expenditures for the year ended September 30, 2012 were e53.8 million, a decrease of
e18.5 million, or 25.6%, from e72.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a 22.8% reduction in investments related to vending equipment and lower capital
expenditure related to vehicles.

Capital expenditures for the year ended September 30, 2013 were e44.9 million, a decrease of
e8.9 million, or 16.5%, from e53.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. The decrease was
primarily attributable to lower investments related to vending equipment, which decreased from
e44.3 million to e38.0 million and, to a lesser extent, to a reduction in capital expenditure related to IT.

In order to reduce capital expenditures from 2011 to 2013, we (i) de-installed approximately 2,800
unprofitable vending machines in the United Kingdom as part of a restructuring of our UK business and
used those machines which were in a reusable condition to support investments both in the United
Kingdom and in other markets, (ii) extended the life cycle of our vending machines by relocating
machines which had reached the end of their life cycle in certain Western and Northern European
countries to markets where older machines can be effectively utilized, in particular in the Baltic countries
and Eastern Europe, (iii) implemented a vending machine stock optimization program across our Group
to provide greater visibility of machine availability across the Group and allow machines to be sourced
and refurbished within the Group, thereby reducing the need to purchase new vending machines, and
(iv) introduced stricter investment thresholds related to the purchase of new vending machines and
equipment in order to reduce the risk of unprofitable contracts.

Although we significantly reduced our capital expenditures from 2011 to 2013, we expect that our capital
expenditures related to the purchase of new vending machines will return to historic levels in the future to
support the investment required to deliver new business growth. Based on a vending machine park
asset value (at cost) of approximately e543.2 million as of September 30, 2013 and an estimated average
asset life of ten years for our active vending machines, we estimate that we will require capital
expenditures of approximately e54 million per year on vending machines to support our current level of
revenue in addition to capital expenditure for vehicles, IT and other equipment. We further estimate we
will require approximately e3 million of capital expenditure per year to support each additional per cent
of revenue growth. Our estimates with respect to such future capital expenditure requirements may vary
based on changes in our product, concept and segment mix.

As our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on different capital intensity in
different business segments, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to new business, levels of
capital expenditure funded through new machines versus refurbished machines and specific initiatives
to develop telemetry and cashless payment technologies, among other factors, we cannot assure you
that our level of capital expenditure will not increase significantly in the future. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to our Business—Our business requires capital expenditures which may divert significant cash_
_flow from other investments or uses, including debt servicing.’’_

-----

Our capital expenditures for the six months ended March 31, 2014 were e29.9 million, and our net capital
expenditures for the same period were e25.3 million. We estimate that our net capital expenditures for
the year ending September 30, 2014 will be approximately e54 million.

**Contractual Obligations**

accrued or that will capitalize over the life of the PIK Loan. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—PIK Loan.’’

(2) The finance lease liabilities relate primarily to motor vehicles and vending equipment.

(3) The operating lease commitments relate primarily to building lease contracts.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

Our off-balance sheet liabilities relate primarily to land, buildings and vehicles under various operating
lease agreements. As of September 30, 2013, we recorded expense of e12.9 million for payments
related to land and buildings and e7.4 million for payments related to vehicles and other assets under
operating lease agreements not recorded on our balance sheet.

Except as described above, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are
reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to a variety of market risks including credit risk,
interest rate risk and liquidity risk. We monitor and manage these risks as a part of our overall risk
management. The following section discusses the significant financial risks to which we are exposed.
This discussion does not address other risks to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of
business, such as operational risks. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and note 7 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Interest rate risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates. Prior to the Transactions, our exposure to the risk of
changes in market interest rates related primarily to our long-term debt obligations with floating rate
interests.

In order to minimize interest rate risk, we had previously entered into swap and cap agreements. All of
these interest rate swaps and caps expired on June 30, 2012, and no further swaps or caps have been
entered into.

The Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at variable rates. While we may enter into hedging
agreements in the future, we may also elect not to do so or the terms on which we hedge may not be
satisfactory or may fail to adequately protect us from changes in market interest rates.

67


-----

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from counterparty failure to repay or service debt owed to
us according to the contractual terms or obligations. We are exposed to credit risk on our trade
receivables, non-current other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents.

Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and ongoing credit evaluations in all of our subsidiaries.
Due to our large geographic presence and large base of clients, we are not exposed to material
concentrations of credit risk on our trade receivables and have no significant exposure to credit risk with
any single counterparty. In addition, due the nature of our operations, a significant portion of our revenue
is received in cash.

We do not believe we are exposed to significant credit risk on our cash and cash equivalents as these are
spread over several financial institutions in different countries.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to fulfill present or future obligations if we do not have sufficient
funds available to meet such obligations at the time they become due. Liquidity risk arises mostly in
relation to cash flows generated and used in working capital and from financing activities, particularly by
servicing our debt, in terms of both interest and capital, and our payment obligations relating to our
ordinary business activities. We manage liquidity risk by continuously monitoring our expected cash
flows and working capital levels and ensuring that adequate borrowing facilities are maintained.

We have several thresholds and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as for using
derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local
currency without the approval of our Chief Financial Officer. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their
foreign currency exposures without the approval of our Chief Financial Officer. Wherever possible, we
require that subsidiaries repatriate all their excess cash and bank balances to Group finance companies
to allow the Group to ensure that adequate funds are made available across the Group as necessary.

**_Foreign currency risk_**

Since each of our subsidiaries invoices its clients in the functional currency in which that subsidiary
operates, and since the significant part of its cost base is also denominated in its functional currency, our
exposure to currency risk is not significant.

Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of operations whose functional currency is not the
euro in our financial statements which are presented in euro. Previously, in order to minimize our
exposure to translation risk, we had established the borrowings and related interest payments in the four
main currencies in which we operate, namely EUR, CHF, GBP and SEK, in order to effect a natural hedge
between our income and interest expenses. The Euro Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility will be
denominated in euro, and changes in foreign exchange rates will therefore give rise to foreign exchange
exposure. While we may enter into hedging agreements in the future, we may also elect not to do so or
the terms on which we hedge may not be satisfactory or may fail to adequately protect us from changes
in foreign exchange rates.

As of September 30, 2013, if the euro had weakened by 10% against the Swiss franc, British pound or
Swedish krona, our net profit would have decreased by e0.7 million, e2.8 million and e0.4 million,
respectively.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes contain information that is
pertinent to the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition set forth
above. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the reporting date. These estimates and assumptions are based on
historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets

68


-----

and liabilities in future periods are summarized below. For a more detailed description of our significant
accounting policies, see note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives_

The cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are
determined based on their values in use. These calculations require the use of estimates and
assumptions consistent with the most up-to-date business plans that have been formally approved by
management.

_Client Contracts_

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of client contracts in a business combination have a finite
useful life and are amortized over the determined life of 15 years. We actively monitor retention rates on
client contracts and consider other relevant factors which may provide an indication of impairment.

_Employee Benefits_

The present value of the pension obligations depends on a variety of factors that are estimated annually
by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions, including the discount rate to be applied to
determine the present value of defined benefit obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate,
we consider the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in
which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related
pension liability.

_Deferred income tax assets_

Deferred income tax assets on unused tax losses carried forward are recognized to the extent it is
probable that there will be future taxable profits against which the losses can be offset. The assessment
of recoverability of the recognized deferred income tax assets is based on assumptions regarding future
profits and is derived from the latest budgets and business plans of the Group.

_Provisions_

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is
based on management’s best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the end of
the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Provisions for warranties are ordinarily determined by product line and are based on statistics including
the likelihood of a breakdown occurring and the average cost of repair or replacement.

_Sales estimations_

Where sales are based on consumption in the machines, there may be a timing difference between the
date on which the cash was last collected from the machines and the date on which the sales readings
were taken. In this case, an estimate of the sales between the date of the last cash collection or the last
machine reading and the end of the period is made. The estimate is based on historical sales trends in
respect of the specific client sites and machines. The estimated amount of sales which have been neither
collected in cash nor invoiced to clients are recorded as accrued income and uncollected cash in
points-of-sale.

_Inventories_

Food and beverage inventories which have passed their sell by date are fully provided against. Similarly,
where the level of food and beverage inventories held exceeds the sales expected to be achieved before
the sell by date, a provision is made for the excess inventory held. Provisions for vending equipment in
inventory are recorded against vending machines in inventory according to the age of the machine.
Provisions for spare parts held in inventory are calculated according to the inventory turnover ratio.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

**The European Vending Machine Operator Market**

**_Overview_**

Information in relation to the European vending industry is primarily available from the European
Vending Association (‘‘EVA’’)[1] which covers 21 countries in Europe in its statistics (most of the European
Union as well as some non-EU countries such as Switzerland, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine). The EVA
estimates that during 2012 there were approximately 3.8 million vending machines in Europe (2.2 million
hot drinks machines (60% of total), 0.7 million cold drinks machines (19% of total) and 0.8 million glass
front machines selling mostly drink and food items (21% of total)). These machines generated 30 billion
vends and total revenues of e11.4 billion in 2012, with our five core markets (Switzerland, Sweden,
France, Germany and the United Kingdom) representing approximately 63% of the European vending
market. The European vending market is mature with few players of international scale and a long tail of
small players, indicating the relatively low barriers to entry, but high barriers to scale.

Based on the EVA, the European vending market in terms of industry revenues grew annually by 1.4%
from 2003 to 2008. In 2009, the market declined by (8.9)% as a result of the economic recession and
financial crisis; this decline was primarily the result of cyclical rather than structural factors, namely a
fundamental linkage to macroeconomic conditions. The EVA estimates that market revenues stabilized
but still declined marginally by (0.2)% annually from 2009 through 2012. According to our estimates,
industry revenues declined by (1.3)% during 2013 due to the continuation of weak business sentiment
and reduced capital expenditures on new machines by vending operators.

**_Overview of Vending Value Chain_**

The value chain for the vending machine industry includes several key participants: (i) machine
manufacturers and payment system suppliers; (ii) coffee roasters, ingredients and consumables
manufacturers; and (iii) specialist vending operators. Specialist vending operators distribute food and
drink products to end-consumers through their vending machines. While end-consumers consume the
products provided by vending machines, Selecta and its key competitors contract primarily with the
facility management functions of private entities (e.g. offices, factories) and infrastructure functions of
public entities (e.g. rail stations, airports). Through contractual agreements, clients compensate vending
operators like Selecta for providing a complete or partial vending concept, including procuring
machines and products and restocking, maintaining and repairing machines at client sites; typically
vending operators benefit from long term contractual arrangements which provide visibility into future
revenues.

Some of the participants in the vending industry value chain are outlined in the diagram below:

industry report titled ‘‘The 2012 Vending Industry Market in Europe’’ and relevant EVA country reports.

**_Vending Operator Business Models_**

The majority of vending machines are operated by specialist operators who own or lease machines.
These operators, such as Selecta, are typically responsible for the procurement and placement of
machines, stocking and restocking of items in the machines, and ongoing maintenance of machines.
There are some variations in business models, for example, in the case of the Office Coffee Service
(OCS) model, operators may also rent/sell machines to clients and sign a technical service or ingredient
supply contract, leaving clients responsible for the regular filling, cleaning and restocking of the
machines.

For illustrative purposes, we have provided an overview of various operator service models below:


**Partial Service Vending / OCS**

- Clients lease or buy the machines
and buy stock from operators under
supply contracts

- Clients fill and clean machines
themselves


**Supply / Technical**

- Operators sell machines and
ingredients to clients without any
service element (both replacements
and to new customers)

- Operators offer technical service
contracts for machines

13JUN201400005295


**Operator**
**Service Model**


**Full Service**

- Machines are owned, stocked, and
maintained by operators. Clients
either pay for their use (by invoice)
and provide this free to employees,
or consumers pay for products
themselves (with cash/cards)

- Machines are generally large and
built for high throughput


Selecta’s business model reflects a combination of the various models discussed above, but with a
focus on full service vending.

Vending services are typically provided to ‘‘private’’ and ‘‘public’’ clients. ‘‘Private’’ clients generally
operate within private or relatively restricted locations such as offices and factories. ‘‘Public’’ clients have
properties which are generally located in more widely accessible locations such as railway stations,
airports, petrol stations and retail malls. Machines are also provided to clients in semi-public locations
such as universities, schools, health clubs and hospitals.

Selecta’s relevant segments of the vending industry focus on three types of machines: (i) hot beverages
(coffee, hot chocolate, tea); (ii) closed front cold beverages (cans and bottles); and (iii) glass front
(snacks, cold drinks, some fresh foods and non-food products). While all of these products are available
through several other distribution channels (e.g. supermarkets, coffee shops), vending machines offer a
value proposition focused around convenience for both consumers and clients. Specifically, vending
machines provide consumers with ‘‘[24]⁄7’’ access to products at particularly convenient points of sale in
private and public locations. Furthermore, full service vending offers clients in private locations with a
convenient (and in some cases fully outsourced) means to promote employee satisfaction via readily
accessible consumables.

Vending operators such as Selecta typically earn revenues from their clients via long term contracts
which provide a high degree of revenue visibility. Contractual agreements vary, but private contracts are
typically for three to five years, while public contracts are typically for five to ten years. Vending operators
generate revenues based on their specific business models and the range of services offered.
Illustratively, a vending machine provider operating within a private setting with a full service vending
business model would earn revenues from the sale of products with prices agreed at the outset of the
contract and adjusted based on a mechanism such as a price index. Operators generally also generate
fixed service/maintenance fees from their public and private clients. Volume-based rebates are typically
agreed with larger multi-site clients. Vending machines in private settings operate either on a ‘‘free vend’’
or ‘‘pay vend’’ basis. On a free vend basis, the client subsidizes the cost for consumers and users do not
need to make payments at the vending machines. Alternatively, on a pay vend basis, consumers
purchase items using coins or a form of cashless payment system without any subsidization from the
client. Products are sold in public settings on a pay vend basis and providers are typically free to set and
adapt product selling prices, but a provider would typically have to pay a rental fee to the client for
occupying the client’s premises.

Vending operators that trade machines are generally more susceptible to economic conditions and
client companies’ budgets for capital expenditures as well as the availability of third party lease finance.
Selecta derives a low proportion of its revenues (12% of 2013 revenues) from the direct sale of machines,
spare parts and ingredients.

Profitability in the industry varies considerably by market and business model and is driven by several
key factors including: number of machines in operation; local machine density and market shares in
specific regions; revenue mix (public versus private, OCS); pricing trends and competitive dynamics in

71

specific markets; ability to pass through cost increases; and companies’ specific cost structures
(including composition of sales and maintenance staff).

**_Overview of Machine Park_**

According to the EVA, the total machine park for vending machines in Western Europe was 3.8 million
machines in 2012. Italy has the largest installed base of machines with 19.4% of the total, followed by
France with 16.9%, Germany with 13.4%, and the United Kingdom with 12.0%. Switzerland and Sweden
represent 2.5% each of the total machine base. Whilst these two markets reflect a relatively small portion
of the European machine park, they have a high machine penetration rate, with an average of 86 and
94 people per machine in Switzerland and Sweden, respectively, versus the European average of
193 people per machine.

According to the EVA, from 2003 to 2008, the European machine park grew at a rate of 3.5% annually. In
2009, the machine park declined slightly by (1.7)% as the recession reduced the demand for vending
machines, particularly in private settings/workplace environments. From 2009 to 2012, the machine park
remained mostly flat and declined slightly at an annual rate of (0.2)%, due to the continued economic
uncertainty in Europe. According to the Company’s estimates, the European machine park also
remained mostly unchanged in 2013.

According to the EVA, of the total European machine park in 2012, 60% of machines were hot drinks
machines, 19% were cold drinks machines and 21% were glass front machines. Hot drinks revenues
grew strongly from 2003 to 2008. However, hot drink machines were particularly hit by the recession in
2009 as most of these machines are located in the workplace. According to the EVA, the hot drinks
market was largely stable from 2009 to 2012. However, it is worth noting that there has been a switch
from instant and freshbrew machines to bean and espresso machines over the past years in this
market—a trend that has been the result of increased focus on premiumization and a larger white collar
workforce.

According to the EVA, traditional closed front machines have shown a strong and constant decline since
2008, largely to the benefit of glass front machines, which have been growing over the same period.
Glass front machines are more flexible in their use and can offer a wider range of products. Innovation
has made these more popular among both operators and clients.

**_Overview of Competitive Landscape_**

The European vending operator market is largely mature and is characterized by a diverse range of
industry participants including both specialists and generalists. The industry is fragmented with few
players of international scale and a long tail of small players, indicating the relatively low barriers to entry
and high barriers to scale. Selecta and Autobar are the only two independent European vending
operators of scale. Operators may, however, achieve a relatively high level of scale and density on a
national or local level (e.g. Switzerland and Sweden), leading to a large number of small industry
participants, which may be profitable due to the density of their national or local network. Based on the
EVA and the Company’s estimates, Selecta and Autobar have European market shares of 7% and 6%,
respectively[2], while the next three largest operators, Coca Cola, Dallmayr and IVS, have market shares of
3%, 3% and 2%, respectively. In the three largest European markets, France, Italy and Germany, the top
five operators comprise a combined market share of 31%, 32% and 20%, respectively. However, some of
the smaller markets exhibit a high level of concentration. In the Swiss market, the top five operators
represent approximately 65% market share and in the Swedish market approximately 77% market share.

2 The country top five combined and Selecta market shares are based on 2012 data except for Autobar, Coca Cola, Dallmayr
and IVS which are based on 2011 data and except for top five operators in Italy and Sweden which are also based on 2011
data.

An important competitive dynamic is the presence of pod/capsule providers in the workplace vending
segment, including Nespresso and Lavazza. Pod/capsule machines designed for the retail channel have
been present in workplaces for a number of years, often purchased directly by employees. However,
both Nespresso and Lavazza are focusing in a more structured way on the B2B channel with a specific
proposition and have gained limited share in recent years, in particular in France and Switzerland. This is
typically limited to the white collar workplace segment. Whilst in line with the ongoing trend of
premiumization, the ability of such providers to take significant share across the vending market with a
B2B offer is currently limited. This is a result of using machines which are typically low throughput
(hotels, restaurants and caf´e (‘‘HoReCa’’) style), the need for a full service model which they have limited
ability/willingness to provide, and the high price point relative to other vending propositions. The use of
retail channel machines and the B2B proposition of pod and capsule players have not been significantly
disruptive to traditional operators. Whilst the growth of pod and capsule players in the workplace is not a
key driver of the recent performance of specialist operators such as Selecta and Autobar, it is a relatively
recent competitive dynamic which will continue to evolve.

**_Industry Drivers and Trends_**

Most Western European countries, including Selecta’s primary footprint countries, reflect relatively
mature markets.

Based on the EVA, the European vending market in terms of industry revenues grew annually by 1.4%
from 2003 to 2008. In 2009, the market declined by (8.9)% as a result of the economic recession and
financial crisis; this decline was primarily a result of cyclical rather than structural factors, namely a
fundamental linkage to macroeconomic conditions. The EVA estimates that market revenues stabilized
but still declined marginally by (0.2)% annually from 2009 through 2012. According to the Company’s
estimates, industry revenues declined by (1.3)% during 2013 due to the continuation of weak business
sentiment and reduced capital expenditure on new machines by vending operators.

Sales in the vending industry vary by country based on various elements including market structures,
consumer preferences and trends and payment methods available. Broadly, vending sales are driven by
the following key factors:

- Consumer behavior, preferences and local trends: Industry sales are to a large extent driven by
consumers’ preferences and behavioral considerations. For example, with changes in work-place
needs and demands, sales of vending products are bolstered by an increase in working hours and
compressed time for meals ‘‘on the go.’’ Industry sales are also impacted by dynamics in specific
markets. For example, on a relative basis historic demand for coffee/OCS is higher in Southern
European and Nordic countries when compared with the rest of Europe; this drives growth in

73


-----

sub-markets based on local characteristics. These trends are evolving, and increasing customer
expectations for coffee quality are driving the growth of premium coffee services throughout Europe.

- Macroeconomic factors: Within the industry, revenues, particularly those related to private sales, are
impacted by the state of underlying economies and employment levels as these factors drive
consumption at client sites through the level of hours worked, purchasing power and clients’
investments in non-essential services. According to the EVA, European vending market revenues
declined by (8.9)% in 2009 during the economic crisis. However, vending providers represent a
relatively low proportion of client companies’ total procurement spending and are thus less
susceptible to longer-term reductions/rationalizations at client sites. Furthermore, companies face
varying exposure to macroeconomic conditions based on their respective segment and product
mixes; for example, public markets are less susceptible to economic downturns driven by ongoing
foot traffic at public locations even during recessionary environments. Even within the private sector,
hot beverage/OCS sales have proved to be more resilient and notably the OCS market has continued
to exhibit growth in many regions even through the economic recession in Europe.

- Contracts: Long term stability within the industry is to a large extent driven by the contracted nature of
revenues. While the proportion of contracted revenues varies by market and segment, companies
such as Selecta benefit from a fully contracted base of revenues which provide a high level of revenue
visibility.

- Condition of machine park and capital investment: We believe that sales of products are also
correlated with the condition of the underlying machine park. We have observed volume and revenue
pick-up following the deployment of new machines and believe that a certain amount of capital
expenditure is required to maintain machine parks with additional capital expenditure required to
achieve growth. The reduced investment in machines in the recent past driven by liquidity challenges
faced by various key industry participants partially explains recent market declines from a volume and
revenue perspective.

- Regulation: The industry is also impacted by developments in regional, national and EU-wide
regulation, for example with regards to the display of ingredients, technical specifications of
machines, ability to operate in certain locations, recycling and waste disposal to name a few. It is our
belief that larger operators such as Selecta are better positioned to understand, influence and react to
such changes than smaller regional operators.

Selecta’s brand, leadership in developing premium products (e.g. Starbucks partnership), high
proportion of public sales, low exposure to direct machine sales and visible contracted revenues
streams provide it with a resilient business model that we believe is less susceptible to the overall
economic environment than the overall industry. This can be demonstrated by its success in gaining
market share relative to smaller competitors in many of its core geographies. Furthermore, we believe
that industry trends will on balance drive recovery and underlying market growth going forward.

We believe the vending market will be impacted positively by the following trends:

- Change in drinking habits

  - Growing trend towards premiumization of coffee drinking provides unique opportunity for
offerings such as Selecta’s Starbucks offering

  - Emphasis on use of fresh milk

  - Request for larger choices of hot drinks

- Mobility

  - With further limitations on time, consumers looking to snack and drink on the go

- Technologies

  - Telemetry and connectivity

  - Ease of use via touch screen user interface

  - Introduction of cashless payment systems (e.g. contactless, sms)

- Workplace trends

  - Outsourcing of coffee services

74


-----

  - Employee push for improved coffee quality

- Increase in partnering with facility maintenance providers/caterers could provide increased access to
markets

Conversely, we believe the following factors could impact our markets adversely:

- Development of new points of sale

  - Increase in coffee shops

  - Longer opening hours of retail stores

  - Decreasing cost of cold drinks and snacks in discount stores (e.g. multi-packs)

- Transition from blue to white collar

  - Vending machines typically generate higher throughput in factories than offices

- Development of alternate technologies

  - Capsule-based coffee solutions

- Increasing intermediation by FM providers / caterers could lead to more aggressive pricing

- Increasing regulation

  - Health concerns by regulators

  - Restrictions on sale of products in public and semi-public locations

Furthermore, some factors could impact our markets both positively and negatively:

- Increasing intermediation by FM providers / caterers

  - Serve as a substitute to our product and service offering

  - However, also provide us with a new channel for offering our services

On balance, and despite the adverse developments referenced, we believe the positive industry
developments will enable the Company to achieve stability going forward, as it is well-positioned to
benefit from some of the trends outlined above through its offerings, the already ongoing
implementation of new technologies and the size of its network. Furthermore, Selecta’s reliance on
contracted revenues in relation to private entities and its high proportion of public revenues provides it
with significant revenue resilience and visibility going forward.

**The Swiss Vending Machine Operator Market**

According to the EVA, the Swiss vending machine market generated revenues in excess of e422 million
in 2012 from 93,510 vending machines with 712 million vends during the year. Hot drinks represent 63%
of the market by value of revenues, with the remainder split amongst snacks at 24% and cold drinks at
13%. The workplace is by far the most common location for vending machines in Switzerland, with 85%
of machines in operation located there. This is above the European average of 80%.[3]

The Swiss market is characterized by a relatively high price point, given relatively low price sensitivity in
the market and is predominantly a pay vend market. Clients and consumers have high hygiene
requirements and high expectations on product quality. Fresh food is a key part of the offering of vending
operators driven by the absence of canteens in many corporate offices. Cashless payment systems are
installed at in excess of 70% of vending machines in private / workplace settings.

Recently, there has been an increasing trend towards premiumization with a shift towards the quality
standards exhibited by coffee houses. These trends include an increased used of bean coffee, instead of
soluble coffee, an increased variety of coffee options and the availability of milk products as well as
high-quality and different sizes of cups. The machine park has evolved to reflect these developments.
New players have entered into the market with Nespresso Professional and with partnerships with
providers offering full service vending in all categories including snacks and cold drinks.

3 EVA data is based only on traditional vending and excludes parts of the OCS market, such as small fully automated
machines, capsule/pod systems and high-end hotels, restaurants and caf´e (‘‘HoReCa’’) OCS machines. According to
experts, this market is growing partially at the expense of traditional vending systems.

75


-----

In comparison to other European markets, according to the EVA, the vending market in Switzerland was
less severely affected by the economic recession and financial crisis with industry revenues declining by
(0.9)% during 2009. From 2009 to 2012, revenues declined by (1.3)% annually, but with diverging trends
in individual years during this period. Total industry revenues increased by 1.6% and 3.1%, in 2010 and
2011, respectively, reflecting significant resilience of the overall Swiss economy due to high immigration
of skilled workers, low interest rates and a real estate boom. However, revenues contracted from 2011 to
2012 by (8.3)%. This was largely a result of foreign exchange rate pressure which reduced exports and
economic activity. In 2013, the market is believed to have remained subdued as employment growth
decelerated. Real GDP growth is expected to continue through 2015 and will likely support vending
growth. Anti-immigration policies after 2015 could negatively impact the economy.

In comparison to other European markets, the Swiss market is concentrated. According to the EVA and
the Company’s estimates, we estimate that we have a market share of approximately 49% and that the
top five operators in the Swiss market (Selecta, Dallmayr, Vending Service, Cecchetto and Leomat) have
a combined market share of approximately 65%. Selecta achieved its high market share in this market
through a process of consolidation over the past three decades. There has been limited M&A activity in
recent years. Selecta particularly benefits from its very strong brand awareness as a result of its high
position in public vending.

We believe that Selecta has a very strong position in the Swiss vending market due to the scale of its
network, its local brand recognition and its historical roots. Years of experience in this market have led to
significant operational knowledge and consequently efficiencies. In combination, economies of scale
and experience in this market have led to industry-leading profitability.

**The Swedish Vending Machine Operator Market**

According to the EVA, the Swedish vending machine market generated revenues of approximately
e257 million in 2012 from 95,806 vending machines with 951 million vends during the year. Hot drinks
represent 70% of the market by value of revenues, with the remainder split amongst snacks at 22% and
cold drinks at 8%.

The Swedish market is characterized by being predominantly focused on OCS, while there is only a
limited market for snacks and soft drinks. The consumption of coffee in Sweden is high, partially due to
the cultural popularity of coffee breaks (‘‘fika’’). The consumption of soft drinks is low due to small
coinage denominations and high prices relative to prices in the retail channel. In office environments,
there is a high proportion of free vends. Over the past years, there has been a shift towards whole bean
premium products, fair trade and organic products as well as fresh food. The Swedish vending industry
tends to have coffee prices indexed to price measures such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or
commodity indices.

The vending market in Sweden was marginally impacted by the economic recession and financial crisis.
According to the EVA, the market increased by 0.8% in 2009. This was the result of both Sweden having
a shorter and sharper recession than many other European countries and coffee being a tax free benefit
in Sweden, making it more resistant to recessionary pressure. From 2009 to 2012, the market declined at
an annual rate of (0.6)%. The sharpest decline occurred in 2012 at (2.3)% due to low business
confidence and weak exports. The current consensus view is that the market began to recover in Q4
2013. Vending market growth is expected to pick-up, due to a pick-up in the economy, employment
levels and population growth.

The Swedish market is relatively consolidated with the top five operators (Selecta, Autobar, Jede,
Jobmeal and Amica Vending) representing approximately 77% of the market. According to the EVA data,
we estimate that our market share is approximately 40%. There has been a degree of M&A activity within
the Swedish market although the relative positioning of operators has remained stable.

Selecta has a long presence in the market going back to the 1950s. The Company is one of the few
operators with national reach in Sweden, which, in addition to providing scale and density, positions
Selecta strongly when tendering for large national or regional corporate contracts, as well as enabling it
to provide a competitive public offering.

**The French Vending Machine Operator Market**

According to the EVA, the French vending machine market generated revenues of e2,027 million in 2012
from 637,475 vending machines with 5,368 million vends during the year. The French market is strongly

76


-----

skewed towards hot drinks with these representing 67% of total revenues, with snacks (20%) and cold
drinks (13%) accounting for the remainder. In the French market, over 80% of all machines are located in
workplaces. The most common payment model is cash, and vending in many workplaces is controlled
by the ‘‘worker’s council.’’

As is the case in other markets, France has also seen a trend towards premiumization. Operators are
increasingly focused on premium and specialty coffee as well as a preference for 50cl PET bottles over
33cl cans for cold drinks. Specifically, glass-front machines selling both food and 50cl PET bottles is the
only category of machines that has been increasing every year since 2003, when the EVA started
tracking data. This switch has also enabled the increase of prices of cold drink products. With regards to
coffee, according to the EVA, the number of instant coffee machines and roast & ground coffee
machines declined at an annual rate of (0.5)% and (9.4)% from 2007 to 2012 respectively; while the
number of bean coffee machines increased at a rate of 4.0% annually.

According to the EVA, the French market in terms of revenue declined sharply in 2009 at (6.6)%. This
was mainly driven by weak macro-economic fundamentals. From 2009 to 2012, revenues declined at an
annual rate of (0.6)%. This was due to continued weak macroeconomic fundamentals, partially
counterbalanced by the increased trend towards premiumization mentioned above. In 2013, the national
trade association shows a (3.0)% decline in the market, driven by a weak economy and a VAT increase.
Market growth is not expected to improve significantly over the next years due to a slow recovery in
employment.

Like the European market in general, the French market is fragmented with the top five operators
(Selecta, Autobar, Darea, Dalliance, and Prodia+) having a combined market share of approximately
31%. According to the EVA data, we estimate that our market share is approximately 11%. Darea is an
alliance of independent regional operators, illustrating the continuing fragmented nature of the French
market. In total there are approximately 1,050 companies operating in this industries of which 94% have
revenues of less than e3 million. Daltys has grown recently by acquiring Dalliance, Coca Cola Vending
France and Codaralp. Historically, consolidation in this market was driven by Autobar. Selecta is heavily
skewed toward public vending in this market.

Recently, we have seen an increased level of competition in the French market as several operators try to
gain market share through lowering prices. This has led to an overall aggressive pricing environment.
Therefore, clients are also in a strong position to push for increasing rents or larger rebates when
contracts are tendered.

In France, Selecta generates a large proportion of its revenues from the public sector in comparison to
its competitors. Selecta’s strong position in the French market is driven by its very large contract with
SNCF. This represents not only a high sales volume and important infrastructure to the regional private
network, it also places the Selecta brand at prominent and high-traffic public locations in railway
stations.

**OUR BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the leading independent operator of vending machines in Europe by revenue, with operations in
21 countries across Europe and leading market shares in our key markets of Switzerland, Sweden and
France. We operate a network of approximately 135,000 active snack and beverage vending machines
on behalf of a broad and diverse client base. We offer a wide range of products in our vending machines,
including hot and cold beverages and various snacks and confectionary items. Our clients include a
large number of both private and public organizations. Our private vending services, which also include
our office coffee services (‘‘OCS’’), are directed primarily at office environments but also include clients
such as hospitals and universities. Our public vending machines are located in high-traffic public
locations, such as airports, train and subway stations and gas stations, where our longer-term client
contracts provide us with a steady stream of revenue. In addition to our public and private vending
operations, we also generate revenue from trade sales of machines and products.

For the year ended September 30, 2013, revenue from our privately placed points of sale, which includes
OCS, accounted for 63.0% of our total revenue. Revenue from OCS alone corresponded to 9.6% of our
total revenue for the same period. For the same period, revenue from our public vending clients, or our
publicly accessible points of sale, accounted for 24.7% of our total revenue. Other revenue and revenue
from trade sales of machines and products accounted for 12.3% of our total revenue for the year ended
September 30, 2013. By product mix, vends of hot drinks accounted for 51.7% of our total revenue for
the year ended September 30, 2013, while vends of snacks and cold drinks accounted for 35.4% of our
total revenue.

Our business model covers the full value chain of the vending services market. Our sales teams originate
new contracts for the placement of vending machines on clients’ premises, and we also bid for
concessions pursuant to public tenders to place vending machines with public entities, such as airports
and train and subway stations. We purchase vending machines for our clients, install them at their
premises and manage the sourcing and stocking of the food and beverage vending products on behalf
of our clients. We also provide cleaning, maintenance and technical support services, which can be
customized based on individual client preferences. In addition to our vending and vending services
operations, we also sell vending machines, vending machine parts and products separately and
independent of vending service arrangements. We therefore generate revenue at each step of the
vending services value chain, through a combination of fees from clients for providing, stocking and
maintaining vending machines, through the products sold from our vending machines and from the sale
of machines, ingredients and spare parts.

We operate our vending machine network primarily under the ‘‘Selecta’’ brand, which we believe stands
for quality and innovation in the industry and enjoys strong brand recognition in many of the markets in
which we operate. We are active across much of Western Europe. For the twelve months ended
March 31, 2014, our vending machine operations in our Central and North regions accounted for 40.8%
and 21.4% of our total revenue, respectively, with France and the United Kingdom contributing 27.8%
and 10.0% of our total revenue, respectively. In terms of market share by revenue, we believe that we
have market shares of approximately 49%, 40% and 11% in Switzerland, Sweden and France,
respectively, based on market size data from the European Vending Association for 2012 and our own
estimates. We are also the overall market leader by revenue in the total European vending market, with
an estimated market share of approximately 7% based on the same market data and estimates.

The European vending machine market is fragmented and characterized by a large number of small
scale vending machine operators. We believe that our business model and our scale provide us with
competitive advantages compared to smaller vending machine operators and present us with
opportunities to benefit from market consolidation in the future. Moreover, as one of the only vending
machine operators with a pan-European platform, we are better positioned than many of our
competitors to provide vending services to large multinational clients present in multiple European
countries.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2014, we generated revenue of e715.0 million and Adjusted
EBITDA of e135.6 million. For the same period, our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.0%.

**Our Strengths**

We believe our competitive strengths include:

**_Diversified and loyal client base with high level of revenue visibility._**

We consider our diverse mix of loyal clients to be one of our key competitive strengths. Our client base
includes a wide range of private and public clients, including companies and office environments,
hospitals and universities as well as airports, train and subway stations and gas stations. We operate a
network of approximately 135,000 active vending machines in 21 countries which further contributes to
our diversified revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2013, our top ten clients accounted for
approximately 18% of our total revenue and no single client accounted for more than 3.8% of our total
revenue. Our client loyalty is reflected in our high level of client retention. From 2011 to 2013, we estimate
our overall average client retention rate was approximately 93% based on total revenue. In addition to
our loyal client base, our high revenue visibility is also due to the length of our client contracts and the
economic terms agreed in advance. In our private vending and OCS service segments, for example,
typical contract terms range from three to five years, while our contracts for public vending services
typically range from five to ten years.

**_Resilient EBITDA and stable cash flow generation._**

Our Adjusted EBITDA has remained resilient through the economic cycle and increased from
e120.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to e132.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 2013, despite a challenging economic environment in many of our markets. Furthermore,
through reductions in overhead costs, our Adjusted EBITDA margin has increased from 15.0% for the
year ended September 30, 2011 to 17.9% for the year ended September 30, 2013. The vending machine
operator business is characterized by favorable working capital dynamics, driven in part by immediate
cash collection at points of sale and high inventory rotation. We also benefit from a steady stream of cash
flows from our vending clients, particularly in public vending, with whom we typically enter into
longer-term service agreements. Our weighted average contract life of our top ten clients is
approximately five years. We generated e72.0 million, e80.9 million and e75.5 million of free cash flow in
the years ended September 30, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Our capital expenditure primarily
relates to investments in new vending machines and refurbishment of our existing vending machine
base. We reduced our total net capital expenditure from e67.8 million for the year ended September 30,
2011 to e37.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2013. This was due, in part, to the combination of
our relocation of unprofitable vending machines and the introduction of stricter investment thresholds. It
was also attributable to an increase in the volume of refurbishment, which allows us to extend the life
cycle of our vending machines by re-introducing them in locations where we face less competition or
where our clients or consumers do not require the latest technological features.

**_Leading positions in key markets._**

We are the leading European vending machine operator by revenue, with an estimated 7% market share
of the European vending market based on market size data from the European Vending Association for
2012 and our own estimates. We are also the leading vending machine operator by revenue in
Switzerland, Sweden and France, with estimated market shares of approximately 49%, 40% and 11%,
respectively, based on the same market data and estimates. We believe our vending machine density in
these markets and certain other regions allow us to realize economies of scale and, together with our
strong brand awareness, high client loyalty and product quality, further enhance our strong market
positions. In particular, we consider vending machine density to be a competitive advantage, because it
offers us the ability to scale costs, including sales force efficiencies and transportation expenses, across
a large number of machines. In addition, we believe that our scale in this fragmented European vending
market positions us to increase our vending machine density in countries where we currently operate
while also positioning us to benefit from market consolidation should it occur.

**_Consistently high margins in our key markets and regions and opportunity for enhancement._**

For the year ended September 30, 2013, our operations in our Central and North regions generated
Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 26.1% and 22.9%, respectively. We have been the leader by
market share in Switzerland for many years and have continuously grown our market share in Sweden
over the past ten years. Our strong market positions in these markets, together with our ongoing efforts

79


-----

to optimize vending machine density, help to drive our consistently high margins in these regions. We
are continuing to apply the same concept in our other regions and markets by leveraging management’s
knowhow and experience to drive profitability in other countries. For example, our Adjusted EBITDA
margin in France increased from approximately 8.9% for the year ended September 30, 2011 to 14.4%
for the year ended September 30, 2013. As we enhance our vending machine density in the countries in
which we operate, we believe we will be able to further increase our overall margins.

**_Strategic opportunities and operational initiatives._**

We have capitalized on strategic opportunities in recent years and continue to implement certain
operational initiatives to further drive organic growth. For example, in March 2013, we entered into an
agreement with Starbucks for the exclusive right to operate Starbucks Corner Caf´es in eleven European
countries. Our Starbucks Corner Caf´es are primarily targeted at office environments, and we aim to
further expand the concept in order to establish a leading position in Europe for vends of premium coffee
in the workplace. We have also undertaken certain reorganization measures to reduce our overhead
costs, particularly related to our workforce and costs related to headquarter functions. From
September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2013, we reduced our overhead costs by e27.6 million. When
adjusted for the one-off items included in Adjusted EBITDA from September 30, 2011 to September 30,
2013 of e14.4 million and excluding e6.2 million of overhead costs related to Selecta Italia S.p.A., which
was disposed of in 2012, we reduced our overhead costs from September 30, 2011 to September 30,
2013 by e35.8 million. Furthermore, we have recently implemented certain procurement initiatives, such
as bundling volumes of supplies, focusing on selected suppliers and streamlining our supply chain. We
have also identified and are continuing to develop new solutions for lead generation processes, target
setting and reporting as well as new incentives and tools to promote our sales force effectiveness.

**_Qualified and experienced management team._**

The members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the vending and retail
markets at leading national and multinational companies. Our senior management team has been
strengthened by the recent addition of our Chief Executive Officer in 2013, who has a proven track record
in operational and financial transformations, and our Chief Financial Officer, who previously served as
our Head of Controlling and has extensive experience in business planning and financial reporting. They
joined our two regional directors responsible for the North and Central regions, who have 13 and
28 years of experience, respectively, at Selecta. We believe that the collective industry knowledge and
leadership of our senior management team will enable them to continue to grow our business and
execute our strategies.

**Our Strategy**

Our primary strategy is the profitable organic growth of our business, which we intend to achieve by
focusing on the following strategic objectives:

**_Achieve a leading position in each of the markets in which we operate._**

We aim to be one of the top three players in each of the markets in which we operate while also
maintaining the leading positions we have established in our key markets of Switzerland, Sweden and
France. We intend to leverage these leading positions, together with our pan-European footprint, to
further penetrate the other markets in which we operate and increase our brand awareness. Due to our
established presence and current leading market positions, we believe we are well-positioned to expand
our client base and increase our market share beyond our key markets.

**_Continue to provide a comprehensive concept offering._**

We believe we have a strong reputation and loyal client base due to our innovative and comprehensive
vending solution offerings. We seek to provide a one-stop shop for our clients by also providing them
with as many of their vending service needs as possible. We aim to further penetrate our existing private
and public vending client base while increasing our focus on clients such as gas stations, universities
and hospitals and strengthening our ties with caterers and facility management companies. We also
intend to drive growth by exploiting opportunities to cross-sell our product offerings and further roll out
our Starbucks Corner Caf´es concept to drive premium coffee services. In addition, to increase our

80


-----

vends, we strive to improve our consumer focus through tailored offerings to consumers’ preferences at
our clients’ locations.

**_Maintain focus on operational excellence._**

We continue to focus on operational excellence to deliver products which offer the best combination of
quality, innovation and technology while optimizing internal processes to increase profitability. For
example, we recently implemented certain measures to improve our procurement organization through
the establishment of a professional, more centralized corporate procurement organization. We aim to
further increase bundling of volumes with selected preferred suppliers to achieve better pricing. We also
intend to further increase standardization of our vending machines to reduce overall inventory levels and
streamline our supply chain as well as reduce its complexity. To further drive productivity and improve
technical support for clients through faster reaction times, we intend to equip our merchandisers and
technicians with the latest handheld devices and introduce dynamic route planning. Handheld devices
will allow our technicians and merchandizers to access information remotely while dynamic route
planning will permit us to plan and optimize routes on a real-time basis.

**_Continue to be a leader in innovation and development._**

We aim to provide our clients with high-quality vending machines with advanced technology and
functionality. We continue to develop new machines together with our suppliers to supplement and
replace our current machine portfolio over time. We believe that our focus on technology development in
the areas of cashless payment systems, telemetry and user interfaces will further increase the appeal
and convenience of our vending machines to our clients as well as our vending products to consumers.
Telemetry will allow us to better track vends of our products, adjust our product offerings to drive vends
and monitor more efficiently when vending machines require re-stocking and maintenance. We further
intend to focus on continued development of new offerings for our products and services, such as our
recent Starbucks Corner Caf´es initiative.

**Our History**

Since our founding in Switzerland in 1957, we have grown both organically as well as through
acquisitions. Following our first acquisition in Switzerland in 1959, we expanded into Germany in 1986,
Sweden and France in 1990, Austria, Slovakia and the Baltic states in 1995, Belgium in 1997, Spain in
1998, the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2001 and the Netherlands in 2004.

In 1985, we were acquired by the Valora Group, and, in 1997, we listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange
before de-listing in 2001. In 2001, we were acquired by the Compass Group before becoming part of
Allianz Capital Partners through its acquisition of our business in 2007. Since our acquisition by Allianz
Capital Partners, we have focused on organic growth and have not made any material acquisitions.

**Our Business**

As of March 31, 2014, we owned and operated a network of approximately 135,000 active vending
machines to a broad and diverse base of clients. Our business operations cover the full value chain of
the vending services market. We purchase vending machines for our clients, install them at their
premises and manage the sourcing and stocking of the food and beverage products on behalf of our
clients. We also offer cleaning, maintenance and technical support services, which can be customized to
individual clients’ preferences. In addition to our vending and vending services operations, we also sell
vending machines, vending machine parts and products to clients separately and independent of
vending service arrangements. We operate our vending machine network under the ‘‘Selecta’’ brand,
which we believe enjoys strong brand recognition in many of the markets in which we operate and
stands for quality and innovation.

**Vending Machines and Services**

**_Vending Machines_**

_Hot Drinks Vending Machines_

We offer a variety of table top and free-standing hot drinks vending machines which serve both coffee
and coffee specialty drinks as well as fresh brew tea, hot chocolate and soups. Table top machines are
primarily targeted at the private vending segment, such as office environments, but are also frequently

81


-----

located in public locations such as gas stations. Free-standing machines, in contrast, are primarily
suited for public locations in high-traffic locations such as airports and train and subway stations. We
offer both table top and free-standing models on a free vend basis, where the client subsidizes the cost
for consumers and users do not need to pay at the vending machine, or pay vend basis, where
consumers purchase items using coins or a form of cashless payment systems. See ‘‘—Vending
_Services—Payment options.’’_

We also provide a range of premium hot drinks vending machines. Premium hot drink vending machines
are distinguished by the ability to vend bean-to-cup coffee with fresh milk instead of milk powder or
lactose powder. For example, our Starbucks Corner Caf´e concept, which we introduced in 2013,
features premium coffee vending machines manufactured by Franke which include space for two types
of whole-bean coffee beans, offer a wide variety of coffee specialty drinks and allow users to choose
from three drink sizes depending on the beverage selection. As of March 31, 2014, we had 75 installed
Starbucks Corner Caf´es on clients’ premises.

Our wide selection of hot drinks vending machines also allows clients to select the right machine for their
needs based on additional factors such as cup capacity, the number of available drink selections and
other features. For example, our Ferrara coffee vending machine has capacity for 500 cups, can vend a
variety of coffee specialties, in addition to fresh brew tea and hot chocolate and includes an integrated
tea leaf brewer which uses filtered water to extract full taste. It also features an integrated color touch
screen that allows users to select and customize their drinks by adding sugar or increasing or
decreasing the strength of drinks to taste. In addition, nutritional and allergy information is available via
the touch screen to help consumers make informed choices.

In 2009, we introduced our own private label coffee blends under the miofino brand to complement our
range of hot drinks vending machines. Our _miofino coffee offering includes mild, mellow and bold_
blends as well as decaffeinated and organic and fair trade-certified blends, including instant, whole bean
and roast and ground options. Specific miofino coffee blend availability varies according to country.

_Snack Vending and Cold Drinks Vending Machines_

We offer a range of free-standing snack vending machines as well as cold drinks vending machines and
combination vending machines. Combination vending machines provide a variety of snacks, fresh food
products and cold beverages. Each machine can be configured as a free vend or pay vend machine,
with pay vend machines accompanied by a choice of various cashless payment systems.

Our snack, cold drinks and combination vending machines are primarily differentiated by their product
capacity. For example, each of our Santa Fe, Santa Fe XL and Boston vending machine models are
equipped to vend snacks, confectionary items, cans, bottles and tetra packs, and their flexible layouts
allow for easy reconfiguration to accommodate changes in product choice or layout. We generally offer
clients a standard assortment of brand name snacks and beverages, but the product mix can also be
tailored to the client’s needs to reflect, for example, particular regional tastes in particular snack foods or
drinks as well as locally-sourced items.

Our newest glass-fronted cold drinks vending machines, such as the St. Tropez, include a modern
cooling system which concentrates the air flow at the front of the shelves in order to provide the next
drinks to be vended at the optimum temperature. They also feature an integrated robotic lift, which
delivers the selected drink to the carousel within ten seconds, and use energy-saving LED lights. These
vending machines can be programmed to automatically switch off the illumination outside of working
hours and/or reduce the chiller during non-working hours.

In addition, our vending machines typically feature separators, which can be easily removed for cleaning
and separate access to payment systems.

_Water Coolers_

Our water coolers are primarily suited for office environments and other private settings. Our water
coolers use tap water with integrated filtration systems to control water quality, allow the water
temperature to be adjusted and, depending on the type of cooler, offer multiple water dispensing
options—unchilled, medium chilled or chilled still water and medium or highly carbonated soda water.
Flavor concentrates can be installed inside the water cooler unit to provide flavored water.

**_Vending Services_**

In addition to our range of vending machines, we offer a selection of various vending services to meet
our clients’ vending solution needs. These include full vending service, hygiene vending service,
technical vending services and vending machine rentals.

Our full vending service is our most comprehensive vending services package. It includes the installation
of vending machines, regular filling and cleaning of the vending machines as well as cash collection and
technical maintenance. In addition, daily or weekly visits ensure that our clients’ vending machines are
well-maintained, functioning properly and frequently stocked with fresh products, including new product
introductions. Our full vending service package also includes technical support for our machines. Our
regional and local teams of Selecta technicians provide maintenance support services, including spare
parts, and are dispatched to clients when a client reports a problem through our call centers. All of our
service technicians receive high-quality training before joining our service network.

Our hygiene vending service typically includes a monthly visit, and, in some cases, more frequent visits,
to the clients’ site to do a technical assessment of the coffee machines and provide a thorough cleaning
of the coffee machines. Hygiene service is an important part of the regular coffee vending machine
maintenance to ensure the quality and taste of hot beverages.

We also offer clients technical vending services, which include regular technical and maintenance
assessments as well as the provision of spare parts. Similar to our hygiene vending service, our
technical support services are offered as a separate package or can be combined with our other vending
services to meet our clients’ specific needs.

_Office coffee service_

OCS is a partial vending service concept primarily targeted to smaller office environments. Under our
dedicated OCS package, we provide our clients with a table top coffee machine and the coffee and other
related products and supplies and visit their coffee machine sites on a monthly basis (or more frequently,
if requested) to do a deep cleaning and technical maintenance check of the coffee vending machines.
The OCS package is ideally suited for clients who prefer to handle the day-to-day machine filling and
basic cleaning and care on their own, supported by regular visits of our service staff for deep hygienic
cleaning and maintenance.

_Payment options_

Our pay vend vending machines allow for a range of payment options from traditional cash payments
with coins to cashless and mobile payment technologies. These include employee cash cards and keys,
banks cards and credit cards, corporate cashless payment systems and mobile phone payments. Cash
card and key options are relatively common among our vending machines located in offices
environments or other private points of sale due to the ability to set different pricing levels for different
consumers, such as company personnel and visitors. Credit card and mobile phone payment options
are more frequently included in vending machines located at publicly accessible points of sale.

Certain of our private vending clients make our vending machines available to their employees on a free
vend or partially subsidized basis. This is particularly true for office coffee vending machines and is more
common among our clients in Northern European and Scandinavian countries.

**Sales of Machines and Products**

In addition to our core vending machine and vending services operations, we also sell vending
machines, vending machine parts and products to clients separately and independent of vending
service arrangements. Certain clients contract with us for the supply of vending products to stock
existing machines on their premises. Revenue generated from such sales is accounted for as trade sales
of machines and products. For the six months ended March 31, 2014, revenue from trade sales of
machines and products amounted to e32.3 million, or 9.3% of our total revenue.

**Clients and Consumers**

**_Clients_**

We serve a diverse client base ranging from small office locations to large corporate clients and public
entities. We broadly segregate our clients into private and public. Typical private clients include offices

83


-----

environments and companies. Typical public clients include airports, train and subway stations and gas
stations. We aim to further penetrate our client base while increasing our focus on clients such as gas
stations, universities and hospitals and strengthening our ties with caterers and facility management
companies to further expand our client base. For the year ended September 30, 2013, our top ten clients
accounted for approximately 18% of our total revenue, and no single client accounted for more than
approximately 4% of our total revenue in the same period.

For public clients and, to a very limited extent, large private clients, we generally pay vending fees, or
vending rent, to place our vending machines on their premises. Vending rent arrangements include both
fixed and variable fee arrangements (based on a percentage of revenue from vends) as well as
arrangements based on a combination of fixed and variable fees. They are based on a number of factors,
including tender specifications for public bids, competitive pressure, contract length, offers by
competitors, expected revenue, locations and the demographics of the relevant locations. Our long
experience in the vending machine operator industry provides us with insight to help determine
competitive yet prudent vending rents. For private vending clients, there is typically no charge to us to
place our vending machines on their premises, although we may agree volume-based rebates with
larger multi-site clients.

In addition to originating new client business, our sales teams coordinate and monitor the renewal of
client contracts and the public tenders in which we participate. In our private vending operations
(including our OCS services), typical client contract terms range from three to five years. Our contracts
with public clients are frequently longer, typically ranging from five to ten years. Our client contracts
typically provide us with the exclusive right to install and operate vending machines on our client’s
premises, although certain contracts with public clients do not include such exclusivity rights. Our client
contracts generally automatically renew for a period of one or two years at the end of the initial term in the
absence of notice of termination. The notice period for termination of client contracts is typically three or
six months for each contracting party. In the event of a breach of contract that has not been remedied
within one month from the provision of notice of the breach, our client contracts commonly allow for
termination by the non-breaching party at any time.

We believe our reputation for quality products, innovation and client service has enabled us to form
strong and lasting client relationships across a broad range of our client base. We believe this is also
evident in our overall average client retention rate, which we estimate was approximately 93% from 2011
to 2013 based on total revenue.

**_Consumers_**

Food and beverage products available from our vending machines are purchased by individuals who
consume such items during breaks, as in-between meals, at recreational or educational facilities, in
hospitals, schools or government buildings or while on the go on public transportation systems, at
airports or at highway service or gas stations. As a result, we devote significant resources to the user
experience and specifically to maintaining our vending machines and keeping them well-stocked with
international brand-name and local products that appeal to a variety of demographics and palettes. We
generally stock our snack and cold drinks vending machines with a selection of brand name snacks and
beverages, taking regional tastes and preferences into account as well as our clients’ choice of certain
products. We also track the most popular snack and cold drink vending products on a country level in
order to seek to optimize the product selection for our clients and consumers.

**_Sales, marketing and client service_**

Our sales and marketing activities are largely organized on a decentralized basis. While Group best
practices, branding and sales and marketing concepts are developed centrally at our office in Cham,
Switzerland, the implementation of such practices and concepts is conducted at the country level.
Similarly, the organization of our sales and marketing teams varies by country. In some countries,
particularly the smaller countries in which we operate, the head functions in sales and marketing are
combined in one role. In larger countries, we typically have distinct sales and marketing directors
responsible for the respective activities, including the setting of budgets and the oversight of small teams
of sales and marketing representatives focused on our clients and services in that country.

We continually aim to provide efficient and effective quality client care. Our business operates with the
support of service call centers in each country, which accept inbound calls for vending machine
malfunctions and maintenance issues, and sales call centers, which place outbound calls to generate

84


-----

sales of our vending machine products and services. Our relevant call centers’ telephone numbers are
displayed on all of our machines, allowing clients or consumers to directly get in touch with us for a quick
resolution of any maintenance or other technical issues. In addition, inbound calls received by clients
can be directed to technicians to help clients troubleshoot or resolve technical issues in order to avoid
the need for, and time and expense, associated with a site visit.

**Procurement**

We have recently taken certain measures to strengthen our corporate purchasing capabilities. As a
result, our Group procurement department is responsible for contracting various products and stock,
including machines, coffee, sugar, cups, stirrers and other ancillary products. Certain other items, such
as confectionary products and vending machine spare parts, and the organization of logistics related to
such items generally remain the responsibility of our local procurement capabilities at the country level.

We purchase our supplies and stock from a number of suppliers, including from private label suppliers
as well as brand name producers such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Kraft Foods, MasterFoods, Nestl´e, WMF,
N&W, Sielaff, Wurlitzer, UnitedCoffee and Tate & Lyle. We choose our suppliers carefully and value
maintaining a broad supplier base. However, in the future, we intend to focus the sourcing of our vending
machines to four selected, preferred suppliers, including: Franke (for our premium hot drinks vending
machines), N&W (for our mainstream hot drinks vending machines), Uvenco (for our combination public
vending machines) and Azure (for our water coolers). For significant portions of our purchasing
volumes, we generally enter into framework agreements with our suppliers pursuant to which products
and materials, quality standards, terms and prices are specified. Such framework agreements typically
have terms of three years.

**Real Estate and Equipment**

We conduct our vending machines operations primarily through vending machines which we own.

We own or lease a combination of warehouses and regional and branch offices in many of the countries
in which we operate. Our properties are typically leased for fixed terms of between five and 20 years. In
general, our lease agreements can be terminated at our option prior to the maturity date, in certain cases
with a penalty. We believe that our properties meet our present needs and that they are sufficiently
maintained and suitable for their intended use.

With respect to other fixed assets, we owned and operated approximately 135,000 active vending
machines as of March 31, 2014 and a fleet of vehicles dedicated to restocking our vending business.
Depending on the country, we lease our vehicles through finance or operating leases. We believe our
equipment is in good condition and suitable for our operations and their intended use.

We depreciate our free-standing hot drinks machines over a period of six years (table top machines over
the period of four years) and snack and cold drink machines over a period of eight years. However, we
are generally able to utilize our vending machines beyond such useful lives. From 2011 to 2013, we
increased the volume of machines we refurbish to extend the useful life of our vending machines.
Machines which are not refurbished and redeployed are either sold or scrapped.

**_Benefits_**

We operate various pension and retirement schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices
in the countries in which we operate. We have defined contribution plans in place for certain employees
in Sweden, France and the United Kingdom and defined benefit plans for certain employees in
Switzerland, France, Germany and Spain. These pension plans provide for the payment of retirement
and certain survivor benefits. Benefits payable under these plans are determined on the basis of any
employee’s length of service, earnings and position. Under the defined benefit plans, employees are
entitled to retirement benefits equal to a percentage of their accumulated savings in the plan on reaching
a locally defined retirement age.

**_Collective Bargaining Agreements_**

The countries in which we operate provide various protections and bargaining or other rights to
employees. These employment rights may require us to expend greater time and costs in altering or
amending employees’ terms of employment or making staff reductions.

We have collective bargaining agreements in place with our employees in Sweden and France. In
Sweden, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, we have works councils in place, representative bodies
for employees with which we agree changes in conditions of employment, such as working hours, salary
levels and benefits. We consider our relations with the works councils to be good.

In all other countries in which we operate, we are subject to applicable national or state legislation which,
in many cases, establish minimum salaries and benefits for certain families of jobs and apply to all
companies employing individuals in these families of jobs. The terms of these agreements vary from
country to country, but they generally address matters such as minimum salaries, salary adjustments,
working hours, breaks and vacation and are typically agreed for terms of up to several years.

**Competition and Market Position**

The European vending machine operator market is characterized by fragmentation and intense
competition. We are one of the few vending machine service providers operating on a pan-European
level. We are the leading vending machine operator in Switzerland, Sweden and France and among the
leading vending machine operators in Germany and the United Kingdom based on revenue. On a
European level, our primary competitor is Autobar, which also competes in multiple geographies in

86


-----

Europe. We also compete with strong regional players such as Jobmeal, Kaffeepartner, Dallmayr, IVS,
Darea and Prodia+, among others, and with Nespresso and other OCS providers, in our private vending
and OCS market segments. In addition, we compete against a large number of small players which
operate a few vending machines on a local or regional basis. See ‘‘Industry Overview’’ and ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We operate in a highly competitive market segment, and if we_
_do not compete effectively, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our_
_services.’’_

**Intellectual Property**

We rely primarily on a combination of trademarks, trade names and license agreements to protect our
intellectual property rights. Our primary trademarks include ‘‘Selecta’’, ‘‘miofino’’, ‘‘fresh+fit’’, ‘‘fresh
point’’ and ‘‘mySoup’’ as well as associated word-picture trademarks. We are also the holder of various
national and European Community trademarks for our ‘‘Selecta’’ brand name in the markets in which we
operate. With the exception of the ‘‘Selecta’’ brand name, we do not believe that any individual item of
our intellectual property portfolio is material to our business or the conduct of our business as a whole.
To date, no third party has brought legal or administrative proceedings challenging the validity of our
trademarks or trade names.

We cooperate with certain of our vending machine suppliers and manufacturers to develop new vending
machine models and technologies. We hold certain intellectual property rights in connection with these
vending machines developed or being developed.

**Information Technology**

Our IT operations have historically been primarily performed on a decentralized basis. In particular, IT
functions related to matters such as procurement, tracking and logistics have largely been managed at
the country level, supported by four teams of IT personnel located in Switzerland, Sweden, France and
the United Kingdom.

We continue to invest in our IT systems in order to maintain and enhance our overall business
processes. We use IT solutions in nearly all phases of our operations, from procuring vending machines,
spare parts and products to monitoring operational processes and tracking logistics and maintenance of
our vending machines.

We recently undertook a detailed assessment of our IT infrastructure, systems and applications and are
currently in the process of implementing an enhanced IT architecture with a more centralized focus, in
particular with respect to our IT infrastructure and core applications. The first phase of this process, the
establishment of a new primary data center in Zurich, has already been completed. Additional phases
include the replacement of certain hardware and developing standard software for certain business
critical processes. While we intend to continue to develop in-house selected business-specific
applications, new software currently being developed to replace our legacy applications will be provided
by third party suppliers.

**Insurance**

We maintain general liability, property, directors’ and officers’ and other insurance policies with coverage
limits we consider consistent with industry practice. The terms of our client contracts typically provide
that the client will ensure that the vending machines placed on its premises are insured against third
party claims and carry certain insurance protection against damage or vandalism, whether as part of its
general insurance policies or insured separately. Our other fixed assets, such as our office buildings,
technical equipment used in distribution, restocking and vending machine refurbishment, information
technology and office equipment, are protected by a bundled industrial insurance policy (damages from
fire, catastrophes, theft, flood and severe weather) that includes a business interruption insurance when
business interruption is caused by an insured property damage. We monitor our insurance policies to
ensure that we remain in compliance with any conditions thereunder. Certain of our insurance coverage
is provided by Allianz Suisse Versicherungsgesellschaft, an affiliate of the Allianz Group and our
principal shareholder ACP.

We consider our insurance coverage to be adequate both as to the nature of the risks covered and
amounts insured for our business operations and review our coverage on a periodic basis. However,
there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a loss or losses which are not covered by our insurance

87


-----

policies or which may be in excess of the amount of insurance coverage. See ‘‘Principal Shareholders
_and Related Party Transactions.’’_

**Regulation**

The food and beverage industry is regulated by various European and national legislation related to food
safety and hygiene, packaging, nutritional information and broader public health and diet concerns as
well as public tenders for the placement of vending machines on public premises. As a vending machine
operator, we are subject to the requirements of a number of EU and national regulations administered by
the European Food Safety Authority and national government entities and agencies in the countries in
which we operate.

The primary EU regulations which relate to our business are EU Regulation 178/2002 and
EU Regulation 852/2004. EU Regulation 178/2002 establishes the European Food Safety Authority as
well as general principles and requirements of food law in the European Union and procedures in
matters of food safety. This regulation is specified, _inter alia, by EU Regulation 882/2004 on official_
controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and
animal welfare rules. EU Regulation 852/2004 sets out general rule for food business operators on the
hygiene of foodstuffs. Additional regulations include EU Regulation 853/2004, which regulates, among
other things, the temperature settings of vending machines that stock products made from or containing
animal products, such as meats and cheeses, and EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food
information to consumers. As we do not manufacture our own vending machines or produce our own
vending products, our daily operations of sourcing and stocking vending products and cleaning and
providing technical maintenance and support on our vending machines are impacted by such
regulations to a limited extent; however, we have to ensure that the vending machines are operated in
compliance with applicable law. Moreover, as we continue to source a wide variety of our vending
products in the countries in which the vending machines are located, our suppliers are primarily
responsible for ensuring that their products meet applicable packaging, nutritional information and other
requirements.

In the EU countries in which we operate, we have implemented Hazard Analysis and Critical Control
Points (‘‘HACCP’’) concepts and systems with regard to food hygiene and in accordance with the
requirements of EU Regulation 852/2004 and applicable national legislation. Our employees in such
countries are trained at least annually to comply with the HACCP procedures.

**Environment and Sustainability**

We are committed to operating our business while respecting the environment and other social
considerations. Our past and present operations, including owned and leased real property, are subject
to environmental laws, regulations and local permitting requirements related to the discharge of
materials into the environment, the handling and disposition of waste or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment. We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable environmental
laws and regulations. We are also committed to reducing our carbon footprint through various
measures, such as supplying vending machines which use modern technology to increase energy
efficiency, disposing of our machines and equipment in accordance with the standards of the European
Commission’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and developing automated route
planning systems to reduce total driving distances. All of our Group’s policies and business activities are
consistent with the United Nations Global Compact. We also take a proactive approach with respect to a
safe and healthy workplace through regular employee training and development, Group-wide employee
satisfaction surveys and a Group-wide health and safety monitoring system.

We believe that promoting ethical business practices and setting sustainable development goals is
integral to the way we do business. To this end, we aim to provide consumers with healthy products from
vending machines such as our Balanced Options program, which includes products that meet specific
nutritional criteria, and our tailored vending solutions with a variety of healthier products for schools,
hospitals and leisure centers. Our miofino brand coffee is already available in eight certified blends, and
we continue to strive to increase the amount of certified products in our vending machines.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, such as
disputes with our clients, suppliers and employees. We are not currently involved in any material
pending legal proceedings nor are we aware of any threatened material claims against us.

**MANAGEMENT**

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)
established under the laws of the Netherlands. The Issuer is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of
ACP.

The Issuer has a two-tier board structure consisting of a management board (raad van bestuur) and a
supervisory board (raad van commissarissen). The management board is the executive body and is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Issuer. The supervisory board supervises and advises

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our_
_indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference_
_to, the underlying documents. Unless otherwise defined in this offering memorandum or unless the_
_context otherwise requires, terms defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor_
_Agreement shall have the same meanings when used in this section._

**Revolving Credit Facility**

On or prior to the Issue Date, we, together with the Guarantors, will enter into the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, which provides for up to e50.0 million of committed financing, all of which can be drawn by
way of loans, letters of credit, bank guarantees or by way of Ancillary Facilities (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), from and including the date on which all conditions precedent to
signing and first utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are satisfied.

In addition, we may elect to request one or more additional revolving credit facilities under the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement (the ‘‘Additional Facility Commitments’’) subject to the conditions set out
therein. We and the lenders in respect of such additional facilities may agree to certain terms in relation
to the Additional Facility Commitments, including the margin and the termination date (each subject to
parameters as set out in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and the availability period.

Amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working capital and other general
corporate purposes of the Group (including capital expenditure and acquisitions of companies and
businesses subject, in the case of acquisitions funded by the proceeds of a loan under the initial facility,
to satisfaction of the Permitted Acquisition Conditions (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) but not for (i) the payment of principal or interest under the Senior Secured Notes
Documents (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or for the payment, prepayment,
purchase, defeasance, redemption, acquisition or retirement of the Notes or any replacement debt
replacing the Notes or (ii) the payment of any dividend, redemption, repurchase, defeasement,
retirement, repayment, premium or any other distribution in respect of our share capital. The initial
borrowers of the Revolving Credit Facility will be certain subsidiaries of the Issuer. Further members of
the Group may also accede to the Revolving Credit Facility as borrowers (each a ‘‘Borrower’’ and,
together with initial borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility, the ‘‘Borrowers’’) provided that the
conditions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are satisfied. The Revolving Credit Facility will
be guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Issuer. The facility agent (the ‘‘Agent’’) under the Revolving
Credit Facility will be BNP Paribas S.A.

**_Ancillary facilities_**

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, a lender may make available an ancillary facility, such as overdrafts,
check clearing facilities, guarantees, short-term facilities, credit card facilities, derivatives or foreign
exchange facilities or current account facilities subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent,
to a Borrower in place of all or part of its unutilized commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Additional facilities_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes the ability for the Issuer and the lender concerned to
add one or more additional revolving credit facilities provided that the maximum aggregate principal
amount of the Total Commitments (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) would not
exceed the lower of (i) e100,000,000 and (ii) 50% of Consolidated EBITDA.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on the date falling 66 months after the Issue Date. Any
amount still outstanding at that time will be immediately due and payable. Subject to certain conditions,
the Borrowers may voluntarily prepay their utilizations or permanently cancel all or part of the available
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by giving three business days’ prior notice to the
Agent. Amounts prepaid or repaid may (subject to the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement)
be re-borrowed.

93


-----

In addition to any voluntary prepayments, the Revolving Credit Facility requires mandatory prepayment
in full or in part in certain circumstances, and if applicable, cancelation, including:

- with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility;

- if required by any lender, following (a) the occurrence of a ‘‘Change of Control’’ (as defined in the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or (b) the sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Group
whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions; and

- subject to the following paragraph, upon a Notes Repurchase (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement).

_Notes Repurchase_

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, any member of the
Restricted Group from prepaying, purchasing, defeasing, redeeming, acquiring or retiring (any such
transaction a ‘‘Notes Purchase’’) any amount under the Notes (including any additional Notes), any
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness or (to the extent not constituting Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness) other Pari Passu Debt (together with the Notes, ‘‘Senior Secured Debt’’).

A member of the Restricted Group may only make a Notes Purchase if:

(1) provided that no event of default is continuing or would result from such Notes Purchase, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Senior Secured Debt immediately following any Notes
Purchase is or would exceed 50% of the original principal amount of all classes of Senior Secured Debt
on the issue or incurrence date of that class;

(2) provided that no event of default is continuing or would result from such Notes Purchase, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Debt immediately following any Notes Purchase is
or would be less than 50% of the aggregate of the original principal amount of all classes of the Senior
Secured Debt on the issue or incurrence date of that class and:

(a) the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are, or will be, at the time the Notes
Purchase completes, canceled in the same proportion as (y) the amount by which the aggregate
principal amount then outstanding of the Senior Secured Debt Notes is less than 50% of the
aggregate original principal amount of all classes of Senior Secured Debt on the issue or incurrence
date of that class bears to (z) 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
Debt on the Debt on the issue or incurrence date thereof; and

(b) following such cancelation, the relevant Borrowers shall promptly (and by no later than three
Business Days after the cancelation or, if later, at the end of the then current interest period for the
relevant Revolving Credit Facility utilization) make such prepayment as is necessary to ensure that
the amount of all utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility does not exceed the then total
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility;

(3) such Notes Purchase constitutes or is otherwise part of a permitted refinancing (including pursuant
to a debt exchange, non-cash rollover or other similar or equivalent transaction);

(4) such Notes Purchase is funded directly or indirectly by Additional Shareholder Funding (as defined
in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement);

(5) such Notes Purchase is funded directly or indirectly by the amount of a Restricted Payment
permitted or not prohibited to be paid to a holding company of the Issuer; or

(6) such Notes Purchase is made following the occurrence of a Change of Control to the extent that the
Issuer has complied with its obligation under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to prepay any
amounts owing to a lender which requires prepayment in accordance with the provisions of the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

At the time of such Notes Purchase, the Issuer is required to procure that any Senior Secured Debt that is
the subject of a Notes Purchase is, subject to the terms of the relevant Senior Secured Debt document,
extinguished, unless it elects not to do so for the purpose of mitigating tax costs in the Restricted Group.

94


-----

The above restrictions do not apply to any Notes Purchase for so long as and to the extent that the Total
Commitments as defined in and under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are no greater than
e17,500,000.

**_Interest and fees_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR or (i) in relation
to any loan in euro, EURIBOR and (ii) in relation to any loan in SEK, STIBOR, in each case plus a margin
of 3.50% per annum, subject to a margin ratchet based on the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio. Each interest period will be one, two, three or six months (as selected by the Issuer) or
such other period as may be agreed between the Agent (acting on the instruction of all of the Lenders)
and the Issuer. We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear on the last day of each successive
three month period during the availability period, on available but unused commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin under the Revolving Credit Facility.

We are also required to pay fees related to the issuance of ancillary facilities, letters of credit, and certain
fees to the Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Security and guarantees_**

The Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed, subject to certain customary limitations and the Agreed
Security Principles, on a joint and several basis, by each Guarantor.

The Revolving Credit Facility also provides that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on the Closing
Date (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) (i) the aggregate consolidated EBITDA of
the guarantors (excluding any guarantor with negative earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization (calculated on the same basis as consolidated EBITDA)) is required to exceed 80% of the
Restricted Group’s consolidated EBITDA and (ii) the aggregate turnover of the guarantors is required to
exceed 80% of the turnover of the Restricted Group, provided that, if either of these requirements are
breached solely by reason of a newly acquired company becoming a member of the Group, there shall
be no breach if (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) the relevant member of the Group accedes as
a guarantor and provides transaction security by no later than 30 Business Days following the relevant
acquisition.

**_Covenants_**

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary and certain deal specific affirmative loan
style covenants and restrictive covenants. Set out below is a brief description of such covenants, all of

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are restricted from utilizing the Revolving Credit Facility unless we
are in compliance with a Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement) financial covenant (as determined in accordance with the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement).

The financial covenant requires us to ensure that the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
as at the end of each relevant period (after taking into account outstanding utilizations since the end of
the most recent relevant period and pro forma for any proposed utilization on the relevant utilization date
(but excluding the cash effect of such utilization)) does not exceed 6.2:1.0. The financial covenant shall
only apply to the extent that the aggregate amount of all outstanding utilizations and ancillary
outstandings under the Revolving Credit Facility on the proposed utilization date (taking into account the
proposed utilization on that date) will be equal to or greater than (i) in the period from (and including) the
Closing Date (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) to (but excluding) the date falling
12 months after the Closing Date, 40% of the total commitments on such date and (ii) in the period on or
after the date falling 12 months after the Closing Date to, 25% of the total commitments on such date.
This financial covenant will be tested quarterly on a rolling 12-month basis.

In the event that the financial covenant is not complied with, such non-compliance may be cured with the
cash proceeds of Additional Shareholder Funding (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility

breach of other obligations; unlawfulness; repudiation; failure to comply with the Intercreditor
Agreement; and events of default that are substantially the same as those applicable to the Notes, the

and/or terminate their commitments and/or declare all or part of their utilizations payable on demand
and/or declare that cash cover in respect of letters of credit and ancillary facilities is immediately due and
payable. Failure to comply with the financial covenant described above shall not be an event of default.

**_Governing law_**

be governed by and enforced in accordance with English law although the additional covenants and
additional events of default, which are included in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and replicate

**Intercreditor Agreement**

In connection with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture, we and
certain of our other subsidiaries will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to govern the relationships
and relative priorities among: (i) the facility agent (the ‘‘RCF Facility Agent’’) on behalf of the lenders

thereof which are not members of the Restricted Group or subsidiaries of the Issuer) (‘‘Shareholder
**Creditors’’) in respect of certain structural debt that the Issuer has or may incur in the future (including**
the shareholder loans provided to the Issuer) and which is permitted by the terms of the Debt Documents
(as defined below).

We and each of our subsidiaries that incurs any liability or provides any guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss in respect of liabilities to those creditors regulated under the Intercreditor
Agreement (other than in respect of any intra-group liabilities, unless the amount of such intra-group
liabilities owed by the relevant member of the Group is EUR 3,000,000 or more in aggregate) are referred
to in this description as ‘‘Debtors’’ (and any documents evidencing such liabilities, the ‘‘Debt
**Documents’’).**

The Intercreditor Agreement will set out, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- the relative ranking of certain security granted by the Debtors;

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

- the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

- turnover provisions; and

- when collateral and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to future indebtedness that may be incurred
by the Debtors provided that it is not prohibited to be incurred by the terms of the Indenture, the Credit
Facility Documents, any existing Pari Passu Documents (as defined below) or with the consent of the
relevant creditor representatives under each such document, which may rank pari passu to the Notes
and be secured by the Collateral (the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt’’, the documents evidencing any Pari Passu
Debt being the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt Documents’’) subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions relating to credit facilities that meet the
requirements of a ‘‘Credit Facility’’ under and as defined in the Indenture and which refinance or replace
the Revolving Credit Facility in full (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the ‘‘Credit Facilities’’ and
the documents evidencing the Credit Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility being the ‘‘Credit
**Facilities Documents’’ and the lenders under the Credit Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility**
being the ‘‘Credit Facility Lenders’’). For the purposes of this description, any references to the Credit
Facilities or Credit Facility Lenders or Credit Facility Liabilities (as defined below) should be read as
including any such refinancing debt and the debt under the Revolving Credit Facility.

The Creditors of the Pari Passu Debt (the ‘‘Pari Passu Creditors’’) will have rights under the Intercreditor
Agreement which are summarized below.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions that will be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions
relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read
the Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines the rights of the
Noteholders.

-----

**_Ranking and priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide, subject to the provisions summarized below regarding
permitted payments, that the right and priority of payment will rank in right and priority in the following
order:

- first, all present and future Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Creditor Representative Liabilities, the
Super Senior Hedging Liabilities, the Arranger Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities and the Pari Passu Debt
Liabilities, pari passu and without any preference between them;

- second, certain intra group liabilities owed to members of the Group where the amount of such
liabilities owed to the relevant member of the Group is EUR 3,000,000 or more in aggregate (‘‘Intra
**Group Liabilities’’), pari passu and without any preference between them; and**

- third, shareholder liabilities (which consists of liabilities owed by a Debtor to any Shareholder Creditor
(the ‘‘Shareholder Liabilities’’)), pari passu and without any preference between them.

The Credit Facility Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties, the Noteholders, and the Pari Passu Creditors will
benefit from a common guarantee and collateral package and no such secured creditor may take the
benefit of any guarantee or collateral unless such guarantee or collateral is also offered for the benefit of
the other secured creditors from the Restricted Group. The Collateral shall rank and secure the liabilities
owed to the Credit Facility Lenders (the ‘‘Credit Facility Lender Liabilities’’), the liabilities owed to the
creditor representatives (the ‘‘Creditor Representative Liabilities’’), the liabilities owed to the arrangers
(the ‘‘Arranger Liabilities’’), the liabilities owed to the Noteholders (the ‘‘Notes Liabilities’’), the
liabilities owed to the Pari Passu Creditors (the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt Liabilities’’) and the liabilities owed to
the hedge counterparties (the ‘‘Hedge Counterparties’’) under or in connection with any hedging
documents (the ‘‘Hedging Documents’’) which document the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities and the
Non Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (the ‘‘Hedging Liabilities’’), _pari passu and without any_
preference between them but, in each case, only to the extent that such Collateral is expressed to secure
those liabilities and irrespective of (i) the order of execution, creation, registration, notice enforcement or
otherwise, (ii) the date on which the liability arose, (iii) any fluctuation in the amount, or intermediate
discharge in whole or part, of any liability.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the guarantees and Collateral will be released in
certain circumstances described further below in ‘‘—Release of collateral and guarantees—
_non-distressed disposals’’ and ‘‘—Release of collateral and guarantees—distressed disposals.’’_

Indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and Super Senior Hedging Liabilities will be secured by first
priority security interests in the Collateral and receive priority to the proceeds from the Collateral in the
event of any enforcement.

Interest rate hedging liabilities in respect of the Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities and
the Pari Passu Debt (up to a maximum amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of financial
indebtedness under any Credit Facility Agreement or Pari Passu Debt with a floating rate of interest and
under any notes constituting Senior Secured Notes or Pari Passu Debt, in each case with a floating rate
of interest) (the ‘‘Interest Rate Hedging Liabilities’’), and currency hedging liabilities in respect of the
Credit Facility Lender Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt (up to a maximum amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of financial indebtedness under any Secured Debt Document
(other than any Hedging Agreement) not denominated in euro) (the ‘‘Exchange Rate Hedging
**Liabilities’’), may be secured and rank pari passu with the Credit Facilities and receive priority to the**
proceeds from the Collateral in the event of any enforcement (the ‘‘Super Senior Hedging Liabilities’’)
provided that the relevant Debtor and the Hedge Counterparty designate such Interest Rate Hedging
Liabilities or Exchange Rate Hedging Liabilities as Super Senior Hedging Liabilities in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement.

All other hedging liabilities in respect of ordinary course and commercial activities not for speculative
purposes and excluding commodity hedging will rank pari passu with the Notes Liabilities in respect of
enforcement proceeds (the ‘‘Non Super Senior Hedging Liabilities’’).

**_Permitted payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will permit payments to be made by the Debtors under the Credit Facility
Documents, the Notes Documents and the Pari Passu Debt Documents, (provided such payments are

98


-----

permitted and not prohibited under such documents). There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge
Counterparties except certain specified permitted payments as described below.

The Debtors may make payments of the Notes Liabilities at any other time in accordance with the terms
of the Notes Documents subject to (a) (prior to the discharge date under the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement), any restrictions on note purchases contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
and (b) (prior to the discharge date under any other Credit Facility Document) any provisions in any
other outstanding Credit Facility Documents dealing with note purchases.

Payments to intra group lenders owed any Intra Group Liabilities (such payments, ‘‘Intra Group
**Liabilities Payments’’) are permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement if at the time of payment no**
acceleration event has occurred. The Intercreditor Agreement permits Intra Group Liabilities Payments if
an acceleration event has occurred if, among other things: (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors consent to the payment, (ii) any managing director of any of the
Debtor incorporated in Germany is required by mandatory law to make or to demand payment of the
relevant Intra Group Liabilities in order to avoid personal civil and/or criminal liability, or (iii) that payment
is made to facilitate payment of the Super Senior Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt
Liabilities and/or the Non Super Senior Hedging Liabilities.

Payments may be made in respect of Shareholder Liabilities if (i) prior to the Super Senior Discharge
Date, permitted or not prohibited by the RCF Facility Agreement, (ii) prior to the Senior Secured
Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the Indenture pursuant to which any Notes remain
outstanding or (iii) prior to the Pari Passu Discharge Date, permitted or not prohibited by the Pari Passu
Debt Documents.

Subject to the certain conditions described below, the Debtors and each member of the Group may
make payments to any Hedge Counterparty in respect of the Hedging Liabilities then due to that Hedge
Counterparty under any Hedging Document in accordance with the terms of that Hedging Document
(whether in relation to a refinancing of Hedging Liabilities or otherwise): (i) if the payment is a scheduled
payment arising under the relevant Hedging Document; (ii) to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s
obligation to make the payment arises as a result of the operation of certain provisions relating to
withholding tax, payments in the contractual currency, judgments, expenses and default interest; (iii) to
the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises from a non-credit related
close-out; (iv) to the extent that the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of
the operation of a credit related close-out under the Hedging Document which arises as a result of an
event relating to a Debtor and where no event of default under any Credit Facilities Document, Notes
Document or Pari Passu Debt Document is continuing at the time of that payment; (v) where the relevant
payment relates to a close-out or termination arising as a result of a bankruptcy event of default or force
majeure termination event with respect to the relevant Hedge Counterparty and where no event of
default under any Credit Facilities Document, Notes Document or Pari Passu Debt Document is
continuing at the time of, or would result from, that payment or (vi) with the consent of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors (excluding the Hedge Counterparties which are owed Super Senior Hedging Liabilities)
and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (excluding Hedge Counterparties which are owed Non-Super
Senior Hedging Liabilities) of each tranche.

An acceleration event includes the relevant creditor representative exercising any or all of its rights under
the acceleration provisions of the Credit Facilities Documents, or any other equivalent acceleration
provisions under any of the Notes Documents or the Pari Passu Debt Documents.

**_Limitations on enforcement by Super Senior Creditors and Senior Secured Creditors_**

For the purposes of enforcement:

- the Credit Facility Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties (to the extent they are owed Super Senior
Hedging Liabilities) and their creditor representatives are referred to as the ‘‘Super Senior Creditors’’
and the liabilities being owed to the Super Senior Creditors are referred to as the ‘‘Super Senior
**Liabilities’’; and**

- the Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors, the Hedge Counterparties (to the extent that they are owed
Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities) and their creditor representatives are referred to as the ‘‘Senior
**Secured Creditors.’’**

99


-----

The security agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral or taking any other enforcement action
unless instructed by the Instructing Group (as defined below). If any of the Super Senior Creditors or the
Senior Secured Creditors wish to enforce the Collateral, either (a) the majority Super Senior Creditors
(being 66[2]⁄3% by value of the Super Senior Creditors) (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’) or (b) the
majority Senior Secured Creditors (being more than 50% in value of the Senior Secured Creditors
entitled to vote as described in the Intercreditor Agreement) (the ‘‘Majority Senior Secured Creditors’’)
(in each case acting through their respective creditor representative) (the ‘‘Instructing Group’’) must
give at least five business days’ (or such shorter period as each creditor representative may agree)
notice of the proposed enforcement instructions to the creditor representatives for the other creditor
classes and the security agent.

If the security agent receives conflicting instructions, then, to the extent instructions from the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have been given, the security agent will comply with such instructions,
provided that, if the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged within six months
of the Time Period Start Date (as defined below) or if no enforcement has occurred within three months
of the Time Period Start Date (as defined below), then the instructions of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors will prevail.

To the extent that the enforcement instructions conflict (and a failure by a creditor representative for the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors to give any instruction shall be
deemed a conflicting enforcement instruction for the purposes of triggering a consultation period and for
determining the Instructing Group), the giving of this notice triggers a 30-day consultation period (or
such shorter period as the relevant creditor representatives shall agree) (the end of such period being
the ‘‘Time Period Start Date’’) during which time the creditor representatives for each of the creditor
classes must discuss the proposals in good faith with a view to co-coordinating the proposed
enforcement instructions.

A creditor representative is not obliged to consult as described above (or shall only be obliged to consult
for a shorter period in the case of the second dot point below as the Instructing Group may determine) if:

- the Collateral has become enforceable as a result of a insolvency event in relation to a Debtor; or

- that creditor representative (acting on the instructions of the relevant creditor group) determines in
good faith and notifies the other creditor representatives and the security agent that to do so and
thereby delay enforcement of the Collateral could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on (A) the security agent’s ability to enforce any of the Collateral or (B) the realization proceeds
of any enforcement of the Collateral in any material respect;

- a period of not less than three months has elapsed since the date the proposed enforcement
instructions were given and no enforcement is being effected by the security agent or the Super
Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged within six months from the date the
proposed enforcement instructions were given; or

- the creditor representatives are in agreement that no initial consultation period shall be required.

If consultation has taken place for at least 30 days as described above (or such shorter period as may
have been agreed between the relevant creditor representatives) (or was not required to occur as
described above), there shall be no further obligation to consult and the security agent shall, subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, act in accordance with the instructions as to enforcement of the
Instructing Group (as described above) and the Instructing Group may issue instructions as to
enforcement to the security agent at any time thereafter.

If the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (in each case acting
reasonably) consider that the security agent is enforcing the Collateral in a manner which is not
consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles, subject to the exceptions to the requirement for a
consultation period described above, the creditor representative(s) for the Super Senior Creditors or the
Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate) shall give notice to the creditor representative(s) for the other
Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate) after which the creditor
representative(s) for the other Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors (as appropriate)
shall consult with the security agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the relevant creditor
representatives may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement provided that such
creditor representatives shall not be obliged to consult more than once in relation to each enforcement
action. If no agreement is reached by the end of the 15 day consultation period, the Instructing Group

100


-----

shall be entitled to issue instructions to the Security Agent as to the manner of enforcement going
forward.

Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain collateral enforcement principles (the
‘‘Security Enforcement Principles’’) and the collateral enforcement objective, including:

- to achieve the collateral enforcement objective, namely to maximize, to the extent consistent with a
prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Collateral, the recovery by all of
the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors;

- either all enforcement proceeds will be received in cash by or on behalf of the security agent or, in the
case of enforcement by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, sufficient enforcement proceeds will be
received in cash by or on behalf of the security agent to ensure that after distribution in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Super Senior Liabilities will be repaid in full (unless the Majority
Super Senior Creditors agree);

- to the extent that the enforcement is over Collateral with an aggregate book value exceeding
e1,000,000, or the enforcement is over Collateral over some or all of the shares in a member of the
Restricted Group, the security agent shall, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if
requested by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, and at the
expense of the Company (unless it is incompatible with enforcement proceedings in a relevant
jurisdiction) appoint an internationally recognized investment bank or any one of a ‘‘big four’’
accounting firm, BDO or Grant Thornton or, if not practicable, from another reputable independent
third party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of the relevant type of
assets, to opine that the consideration received for any disposal is fair from a financial point of view
taking into account all relevant circumstances (the ‘‘Financial Advisor’s Opinion’’);

- the security agent will be under no obligation to appoint a financial advisor or to seek the advice of a
financial advisor, unless expressly required to do so by and in accordance with the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement;

- the Financial Advisor’s Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the Collateral Enforcement Principles
have been met; and

- if any enforcement action of collateral is conducted by way of public or private auction or other
competitive sale process, which is conducted with the advice of an independent investment bank or
intentionally recognized firm of accountants or a reputable independent third party professional firm
which is regularly engaged in such sale processes (a ‘‘Competitive Sales Process’’), no Financial
Advisor needs to be appointed in respect of such enforcement action.

**_Limitation on Enforcement of Intra Group Liabilities and Shareholder Liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder Liabilities will not be permitted to take
any enforcement action in respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date (other than certain
specific enforcement action as set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) save that, after the occurrence of
an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Restricted Group, each intra group lender or
shareholder creditor (as the case may be) may (unless otherwise directed by the security agent or
unless the security agent has taken, or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that
intra group lender or shareholder creditor (as the case may be) in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) and shall, if so directed by the security agent, exercise any right it may otherwise have
against that member of the Restricted Group to:

- accelerate any of that member of the Restricted Group’s Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder
Liabilities (as the case may be) or declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

- make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that
member of the Restricted Group in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder Liabilities (as
the case may be);

- exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Intra Group Liabilities or
Shareholder Liabilities (as the case may be) of that member of the Restricted Group; or

- file claims, or claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Restricted Group for the Intra
Group Liabilities or Shareholder Liabilities (as the case may be) owing to it.

101


-----

No Intra-Group Lender incorporated in Germany shall be prevented from exercising any of the rights
referred to in this section if and to the extent the exercise of such rights is required by mandatory law to
avoid any personal civil and/or criminal liability of any managing director of that Intra-Group Lender.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exclusions, if any Super Senior Creditor, Noteholder, Non-Super Senior Hedge
Counterparty or Pari Passu Creditor (or any of their respective creditor representatives) receives or
recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any Collateral except in accordance with ‘‘—Application of
_proceeds’’ below, that person must:_

- in relation to amounts not received or recovered by way of set-off, hold that amount on trust for the
security agent and promptly pay an amount equal to that amount to the security agent for application
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the security agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions, if at any time prior to the Final Discharge Date any Intra Group Lender or
Shareholder Creditor (each a ‘‘Subordinated Creditor’’) receives or recovers any amount in respect of
the Intra Group Liabilities or Shareholder Liabilities (together the ‘‘Subordinated Liabilities’’) which it is
not permitted to receive or recover by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, or receives or recovers
the proceeds of enforcement of any Collateral except in accordance with ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’
below, or receives or recovers any amount in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities after the occurrence
of a Distress Event or as a result of litigation against a Debtor or member of the Group (other than after
the occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of that Debtor or Group member), or receives or
recovers any amount in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities except in accordance with ‘‘—Application
_of proceeds’’ below and made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an insolvency event in respect of_
the relevant Debtor, that person must:

- in relation to amounts not received or recovered by way of set-off, hold that amount on trust for the
security agent and promptly pay an amount equal to that amount to the security agent for application
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the security agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of proceeds_**

All amounts from time to time received pursuant to the provisions described under ‘‘—Turnover’’ above
or recovered by or on behalf of the security agent in connection with the realization or enforcement of all
or any part of the Collateral or any other distressed disposal or otherwise paid to the security agent under
the Intercreditor Agreement for application as set forth below, shall be held by or on behalf of the security
agent on trust and applied in the following order:

- first, (i) pari passu and pro rata any sums owing to the security agent, any receiver, attorney or agent of
the security agent, any Pari Passu Debt representative in respect of any Pari Passu Debt issued in the

then (ii) pari passu and pro rata to each creditor representative (to the extent not included in (i) above
and excluding any Hedge Counterparty in its capacity as its own creditor representative) of the unpaid
fees, costs, expenses and liabilities (and all interest thereon as provided in the relevant Debt
Documents) of each such creditor representative and any receiver, attorney or agent appointed by
such creditor representative under any collateral document or the Intercreditor Agreement (to the
extent that the collateral concerned has been given in favor of such obligations);

- second, pari passu and pro rata, in or towards payment of all costs and expenses incurred by the
Super Senior Creditors in connection with any realization or enforcement of the Collateral taken in
accordance with the terms of the collateral documents and the Intercreditor Agreement whether at the
request of the security agent or otherwise;

- third, pari passu and pro rata in or towards payment between (i) the RCF Facility Agent on its own

of the Hedge Counterparties for application towards any Non-Super Senior Hedging Liabilities;

- sixth, after the Final Discharge Date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the Debtors.

**_Option to purchase_**

One or more of the Noteholders or Pari Passu Creditors may, following an acceleration event in relation
to the Super Senior Liabilities, the Notes or the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities or enforcement of the
Collateral, and subject to various conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (including the grant of
an acceptable indemnity against clawback to the Credit Facility Lenders), exercise an option to purchase
all (but not part of) the Credit Facilities Liabilities and the Super Senior Hedging Liabilities.

**_Release of collateral and guarantees—non-distressed disposals_**

In circumstances where a disposal is not a distressed disposal (including a solvent liquidation or
reorganization of any Debtor or member of the Group that results in no person or a different person
owning the relevant assets, and such action is otherwise permitted or not prohibited by (and does not
result in a default under any of) the Credit Facility Documents, the Notes Documents and the Pari Passu
Debt Documents), the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for release of the security and otherwise that
the security agent named therein is authorized and instructed:

- to release the Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset; and

- if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a member of the Group, to release the Collateral
or any other claim over the assets of that Group Member and (where the disposal is to a person which
is not a member of the Restricted Group) the assets of any of their subsidiaries,

provided that (i) to the extent replacement Collateral is required from the transferee under the relevant
Debt Documents, any required replacement collateral is granted by the transferee before or at the same
time as the release and, (ii) if required by the terms of the relevant Debt Documents, any proceeds from
the disposal are applied in mandatory prepayment of the relevant debt.

**_Release of collateral and guarantees—distressed disposals_**

In circumstances where a distressed disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the security agent is authorized and instructed:

- to release the Collateral or any other claim over the relevant asset;

- if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (i) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities as described in the
Intercreditor Agreement and certain guaranteeing liabilities and other liabilities as described in the
Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) any Collateral granted over that Debtor’s assets and the assets of any of
its subsidiaries and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra group lender over that Debtor’s assets or
over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor;

103


-----

- if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor,
to release (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of
its borrowing liabilities as described in the Intercreditor Agreement, certain guaranteeing liabilities as
described in the Intercreditor Agreement and certain other liabilities as described in the Intercreditor
Agreement, (ii) any Collateral granted over the assets of any subsidiary of that holding company and
(iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra group lender over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that holding company;

- if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of
a Debtor, to dispose of all or any part of that Debtor’s or the holding company of that Debtor’s
borrowing liabilities, certain guaranteeing liabilities and certain other liabilities; and

- if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of
a Debtor, to transfer intra group liabilities and debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company of a Debtor to another Debtor.

Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds
waterfall described above under ‘‘—Application of proceeds.’’

**_Amendment_**

Except for (i) amendments to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency which may be
effected by the creditor representatives, the security agent and the Company, or (ii) amendments which
only affect one class of the relevant creditors which could not reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the interests of the other classes (in which case only written agreement from that class
will be required), the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, the required percentage of the Noteholders (as set out in the Indenture) and the
required percentage of Pari Passu Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt documentation),
the Issuer and the security agent unless it relates to certain specified matters such as ranking, priority,
subordination, turnover, enforcement, disposal proceeds, amendments or the payment waterfall. Such
amendments require consent from all of the Credit Facility Lenders, the Trustee (acting in accordance
with the Indenture) (as applicable), the Pari Passu Debt representative (acting in accordance with the
relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents), each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent that the amendment or
waiver would adversely affect the Hedge Counterparties), the Company and the security agent.

No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or
withdraw or reduce the rights of any party (other than, in the case of the Credit Facility Lenders, the
Noteholders, the Pari Passu Creditors and the Hedge Counterparties) in a way which affects creditors of
that party’s class generally or, in the case of the Debtors or third party creditor, to the extent consented to
by the Company) to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of that party (or, in the case of
the Noteholders and Pari Passu Creditors in respect of an issue of debt securities, the relevant creditor
representative).

To the extent the Debtors wish to enter into Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement
indebtedness (‘‘Additional Indebtedness’’) which is permitted to share in the Collateral pursuant to the
Credit Facilities Documents, the Notes and other Pari Passu Debt Documents, then the parties to the
Intercreditor Agreement may be required to enter into documentation to implement this (including
without limitation a replacement intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement).

**PIK Loan**

On May 30, 2014, Selecta Group S.`a r.l. (‘‘Luxco’’), entered into a PIK facility agreement governed by
English law with a facility agent and certain investors as lenders providing for a e220.0 million term loan
facility (the ‘‘PIK Loan’’). The facility will be fully drawn on the Issue Date with the proceeds being on-lent
to the Issuer on the Issue Date by way of an intercompany loan (the ‘‘PIK Proceeds Loan’’) and used to
partially repay the Existing Credit Facilities by the Issuer. The PIK Loan facility agreement matures on the
seventh anniversary of the Issue Date. Except for the first interest period, which ends on June 30, 2014,
interest accrues semi-annually in arrear commencing on the Issue Date. Interest accrued on the PIK
Loan will be capitalized unless Luxco in its sole discretion elects to pay in cash on the relevant due date.
The PIK Loan facility agreement provides for customary non-call protection in the first year and is
otherwise pre-payable at any time. The PIK Loan is secured by first priority security over the shares in
Luxco and the Issuer. In addition, the PIK Loan is secured by a first priority security over any loans
granted by the Parent to Luxco and by Luxco to the Issuer (including the PIK Proceeds Loan). Certain
investors in the PIK Loan will hold warrants in respect of the shares of Luxco, which include certain
corporate governance rights for the warrant holders.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Selecta Group B.V. (the ‘‘Issuer’’) will issue e350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior
Secured Notes due 2020 (the ‘‘Euro Notes’’) and CHF 245 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50%
Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (the ‘‘CHF Notes’’ and, together with the Euro Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’) under
an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) among, inter alios, the Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as the
trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as the security agent (the ‘‘Security
_Agent’’), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities_
Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’).

Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined under the caption ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’
have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. You can find the definitions of certain terms used
in this description under the caption ‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’ In this description, references to (i) the
‘‘Issuer’’ refers only to Selecta Group B.V. and not to any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ ‘‘us’’
refer to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the ‘‘Notes’’
include the Notes and any Additional Notes (as defined below) that are issued under the Indenture. The
Security Documents referred to under the caption ‘‘—Collateral’’ define the terms of the security that will
secure the Notes. The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and
refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, and certain other agreements relating
to the Notes. This description does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read
the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and
not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Indenture, the form of Note,
the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth under the caption
‘‘—Additional Information.’’

The registered holder of a Note (each, a ‘‘Holder’’) will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
Holders will have rights under the Indenture.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’ for purposes of the
Indenture. Under the circumstances described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Designation of
_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted_
Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

- will be general obligations of the Issuer;

- will be guaranteed by the Guarantors;

- will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement of
the Liens over the Collateral only after any obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
priority Hedging Obligations have been paid in full;

- will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including its obligations under the Revolving Credit
Facility;

- will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Notes or that secure the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
Hedging Obligations on a priority basis, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such obligations; and

- will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that
are not Guarantors.

**_Notes Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. For a description of certain guarantee limitations, see
‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

The Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor:

- will be a general obligation of that Guarantor;

- will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the Collateral, but will receive proceeds from enforcement of
the Liens over the Collateral only after any obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain
priority Hedging Obligations have been paid in full;

- will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations of the relevant Guarantor that are
secured by property or assets that do not secure such Notes Guarantees or that secure the Revolving
Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations on a priority basis, to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligations;

- will be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are
not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, including its obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility;

- will be subject to certain restrictions on enforcement of Collateral and release of the Notes Guarantee
of any Guarantor to the extent such Subsidiary is sold by the Security Agent pursuant to an
enforcement action. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’;
and

- will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Any right of the Issuer or any Guarantor to
receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s
bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate in the
distribution of those assets) will be structurally subordinated to that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s
Indebtedness and other obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and lease obligations,
if any), except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the
non-guarantor Subsidiary. Even in this case, the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor would still be
effectively subordinated to any obligations secured over the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and
subordinated in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary that is senior to
the claims held by the Issuer or such Guarantor. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014,
the Guarantors accounted for 85.4% of our consolidated total revenue and 98.0% of our Adjusted
EBITDA. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Each
_Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Limitations on_
_Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.’’_

The Issuer is a holding company without operations, and, therefore, the Issuer depends on the cash flow
of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligation under the Notes. The Notes will be
structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade
payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not provide Notes Guarantees.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

On or prior to the Issue Date, the Trustee will enter into an Intercreditor Agreement with, inter alios, the
agent and lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, holders of certain Subordinated
Shareholder Debt and the Security Agent. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any
liabilities in respect of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain priority Hedging
Obligations (‘‘Super Senior Hedging Liabilities’’ as described in ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’) that are permitted to be incurred by clause (8) of the second_
paragraph of the covenant under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ and certain future Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture (subject to_
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, and permitted to be

106


-----

secured on the Collateral (see ‘‘Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens’’) will receive priority with
respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Collateral. Any proceeds received
upon any enforcement over any Collateral, after all obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility have
been repaid, certain future indebtedness permitted by the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, and such ‘‘Super Senior Hedging
Liabilities’’ (as described in ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’)
have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations
under the Indenture and the Notes and any other Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors
permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis pursuant to the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will override anything in the Revolving Credit Facility or the
Indenture to the contrary.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue e350 million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes in this Offering. The Euro
Notes will be issued in denominations of e100,000 and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof. The
Euro Notes will mature on June 15, 2020.

The Issuer will issue CHF 245 million in aggregate principal amount of CHF Notes in this Offering. The
CHF Notes will be issued in denominations of CHF 150,000 and integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in
excess thereof. The CHF Notes will mature on June 15, 2020.

The Issuer may issue additional Notes (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) under the Indenture from time to time
after this Offering. Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Indenture,
including the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness
_and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ The Notes and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the_
Indenture will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided in
the Indenture; _provided,_ _however, that Additional Notes that are not fungible with the Notes for U.S._
federal income tax purposes shall have a separate ISIN or other identifying number from the Notes. Each
of the Euro Notes and the CHF Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes, but shall be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or other
modification of the Indenture or any other action by the Holders of the Notes hereunder, except as
otherwise provided in the Indenture.

**_Interest_**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of 6.50% per annum in the case of the Euro Notes, and 6.50%
per annum in the case of the CHF Notes. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrear on
June 15 and December 15, commencing on December 15. Interest on overdue principal and interest,
including Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than the
interest rate on the applicable Notes. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record
on the immediately preceding June 1 and December 1.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30 day months.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a ‘‘Paying Agent’’) for the Notes, including a
Paying Agent in the City of London. The Issuer will ensure that it maintains a Paying Agent in a member
state of the European Union that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European
Union Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended from time to time) or any other directive implementing the
conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 26 and 27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings
income, or any law implementing, or complying with or introduced in order to conform to, such directive.
The initial Paying Agent in London will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’) for so long as the Notes are
listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and its rules so require. The Issuer will also maintain a
transfer agent (a ‘‘Transfer Agent’’) in Luxembourg. The initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be

107


-----

Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar and the Transfer Agent will maintain a register reflecting
ownership of Definitive Registered Notes (as defined under ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’)
outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and facilitate transfer of Definitive Registered
Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the Transfer Agents without prior notice to
the Holders. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the_
official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will initially be issued in the form of registered notes in global form without interest coupons,
as follows:

- Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’). The 144A Global Notes
will, upon issuance, be deposited with the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream and registered in the name of its nominee.

- Each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the ‘‘Reg S Global Notes’’ and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’).
The Reg S Global Notes will, upon issuance, be deposited with the common depositary for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of its nominee.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to Persons that
have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to
the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully
under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, pursuant to
customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes, or the ‘‘Restricted Book Entry Interests,’’ may be
transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes,
as applicable, or the ‘‘Reg S Book Entry Interests’’ only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest (as defined under ‘‘Book Entry, Delivery and Form’’) that is transferred as
described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note
to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it
was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of e100,000
and integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Euro Notes, and CHF 150,000 and
integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the CHF Notes, upon receipt by the
applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates and other documentation
required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and
will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more
fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

108


-----

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may
be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of e100,000 and integral
multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes, and CHF 150,000 and integral
multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the CHF Notes, to persons who take delivery
thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream where appropriate, furnish certain certificates and opinions and pay any Taxes
in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange;
_provided that, if the Issuer or any Guarantor takes delivery of the Definitive Registered Notes pursuant to_
the transfer or exchange, the Holder will not be required to pay such Taxes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of such Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of such Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrar will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note
as the owner of it for all purposes.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of the
Guarantors with respect to any Notes Guarantee will be made free and clear of and without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) any jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Guarantor is then
incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes
or any political subdivision thereof or therein or (2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment is
made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent) or
any political subdivision thereof or therein (each, a ‘‘Tax Jurisdiction’’) will at any time be required to be
made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer under or with respect to the Notes or any of
the Guarantors with respect to any Notes Guarantee, including, without limitation, payments of principal,
redemption price, purchase price, interest or premium, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, will pay such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order
that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by each Holder after such withholding,
deduction or imposition (including any such withholding, deduction or imposition from such Additional
Amounts) will equal the respective amounts that would have been received in respect of such payments
in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no Additional Amounts will be
payable with respect to:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner of, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, the
relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited liability
company or corporation) and the relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or
having been a citizen, resident or national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a
trade or business therein, or having or having had a permanent establishment therein), but
excluding any connection arising merely from the holding of such Note, the enforcement of rights
under such Note or under a Notes Guarantee or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note
or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of a Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made

109


-----

available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(4) any Taxes withheld, deducted or imposed on a payment to an individual that are required to be
made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC (as amended from time to time) or any
other directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26 and
27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with or
introduced in order to conform to, such directive;

(5) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to a payment made to a Holder or beneficial owner of Notes
who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note
to another Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction;

(6) any Taxes payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments under, or with respect to,
the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(7) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or
beneficial owner of Notes, following the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder or
beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable the Holder or beneficial owner acting
reasonably to comply with that request), to comply with any certification, identification, information
or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or published
administrative practice of a Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the
rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction (including, without
limitation, a certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Tax Jurisdiction),
but in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such
certification or documentation;

(8) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor to the Holder if
such Holder is a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such
payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payments had such Holder
been the sole beneficial owner of such Note;

(9) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), as of the issue date (or any amended or
successor version of such sections), any regulations promulgated thereunder, any official
interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental
agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing or
any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(10) any combination of items (1) through (9) above.

In addition to the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will also pay and indemnify the Holders for
any Taxes, which are levied by any Tax Jurisdiction on the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of
any of the Notes, the Indenture or any Notes Guarantee or any other document referred to therein (other
than a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale by the Initial Purchasers) or the receipt of any
payments with respect thereto (limited, solely in the case of taxes attributable to the receipt of any
payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Tax Jurisdiction that are not excluded
under clauses (1) through (5), (7) through (9) above or any combination thereof), or any such Taxes
imposed by any Tax Jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of any of the Notes
or any Notes Guarantee.

If the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Notes
Guarantee, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee on a date
that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor
becomes aware of the obligation to pay Additional Amounts less than 45 days prior to that payment date,
in which case the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an
Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to
be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to
enable the Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date. The
Trustee shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

110


-----

The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will make or cause to be made all withholdings and deductions
required by law and will timely remit or cause to be remitted the full amount deducted or withheld to the
relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will use its
reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld. The Issuer or the relevant Guarantor will furnish to the Trustee, within a reasonable
time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax
receipts evidencing payment by the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding
such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments
(reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) by such entity. Upon reasonable request, copies of tax receipts
or other evidence of payment, as the case may be, will be made available by the Trustee to the Holders or
beneficial owners of the Notes. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will
be made available at the offices of the Luxembourg Paying Agent if the Notes are then listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will attach to each
certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certificated
copy was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding
and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid per e1,000 principal amount of the Euro Notes or
CHF 1,000 principal amount of the CHF Notes, as the case may be. If requested by the Trustee, the
Issuer or the Guarantors will provide to the Trustee such information as may be in the possession of the
Issuer or the Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Trustee) to enable the Trustee to
determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular Holder, provided, however, that
in no event shall the Issuer or the Guarantors be required to disclose any information that it reasonably
deems to be confidential.

Whenever in the Indenture or in this Description of the Notes there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of amounts based upon the principal amount of the Notes or of principal, interest or of any
other amount payable under, or with respect to, any of the Notes or Notes Guarantees, such mention
shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction
in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is incorporated, organized, engaged in
business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any
payment on the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made and any department or political subdivision
thereof or therein.

**The Notes Guarantees**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. The Notes Guarantees will be joint and several
obligations of each Guarantor. Each Notes Guarantee is a full and unconditional guarantee of the
Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, subject to the contractual limitations discussed below.

Each of the Notes Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or
otherwise ineffective under applicable law, including laws relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent
transfer, maintenance of share capital and liquidity, corporate benefit, financial assistance or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally, or otherwise to reflect applicable laws, including laws relating
to capital maintenance and the liability of directors and officers. By virtue of these limitations, a
Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or any security interest, as applicable, could be
significantly less than amounts payable in respect of the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—Each Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may_
_limit its validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees_
_and the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.’’_

The operations of the Issuer will be conducted through its Subsidiaries and therefore the Issuer will
depend on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the
Notes. Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be structurally
subordinated in right of payment to all obligations (including trade payables, preference shares and
lease obligations, if any) of the Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any
Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor

111


-----

Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to participate in those
assets) will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors,
except to the extent that the Issuer or such Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the
non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be,
would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor
Subsidiary and any obligations of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer or such
Guarantor.

**_Release of the Notes Guarantees_**

The Notes Guarantees will be released:

(1) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person
that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of
the Indenture;

(2) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Guarantor or any
holding company of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to
such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does
not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

(3) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and ‘‘—Satisfaction
_and Discharge’’;_

(5) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture
and the Notes;

(6) as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) in accordance with the caption ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’;

(8) as a result of a transaction permitted by ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,’’ to the extent
provided therein; or

(9) with respect to the Notes Guarantee of any Guarantor that was required to provide such Notes
Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Issuances of Notes Guarantees of Indebtedness’’ upon such Guarantor being unconditionally_
released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Indebtedness giving rise to the
requirement to provide such Notes Guarantee so long as no Default or Event of Default would arise
as a result and no other Indebtedness is at that time guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor that
would result in the requirement that such Guarantor provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to the
covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Issuances of Notes
_Guarantees of Indebtedness.’’_

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release as specified above, the Trustee will execute any documents
reasonably required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Notes Guarantee. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the
Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Collateral**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by first-ranking Liens over the following collateral
(collectively, the ‘‘Collateral’’):

(t) substantially all of the assets (other than fixed security over bank accounts) of Selecta UK Limited;

(u) shares held by Selecta Holding GmbH in Selecta Deutschland GmbH;

(v) certain receivables of Selecta Deutschland GmbH;

(w) certain receivables of Selecta Holding GmbH; and

(x) intercompany receivables of certain of the Guarantors.

The Collateral will be pledged, assigned or otherwise secured pursuant to the Security Documents to the
Security Agent, acting for itself and on behalf of the holders of the secured obligations that are secured
by the Collateral, including the Holders of the Notes, the Trustee, the lenders under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations or, with respect to the Security
Documents governed by French law, acting in its capacity as parallel debt creditor pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Indenture, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain
additional Indebtedness that may share in the Collateral, including additional Permitted Collateral Liens
securing Indebtedness on a _pari passu basis with the Notes, including Indebtedness under the_
Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging Obligations (provided that the proceeds from any
recovery from the enforcement of any security interest will be applied to satisfy the obligations under the
Revolving Credit Facility, certain priority Hedging Obligations and certain future Indebtedness permitted
under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement),
if any, before being applied to satisfy obligations to Holders under the Notes and the Indenture). The
amount of such Permitted Collateral Liens will be limited by the covenants described under the captions
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Liens’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Preferred Stock.’’ Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Indebtedness secured by_
Permitted Collateral Liens could be significant.

The obligations under the Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain
future Indebtedness permitted under the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and any

113


-----

Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, will be secured equally and ratably by first-ranking Liens over
the Collateral, however, any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any of the Collateral will only
be applied in repayment of the Notes, and all other debt secured on a priority basis with the Notes, after
all liabilities in respect of the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain priority Hedging
Obligations and certain future Indebtedness permitted by the Indenture (subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement), if any, have been paid from such recoveries.
See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

Under the Security Documents, the Collateral will be pledged, assigned or otherwise secured by the
Issuer and the Guarantors to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’, as
applicable, payment obligations under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security
Documents will be entered into by, inter alios, the Security Agent or its nominee(s), who will act as
Security Agent for the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, counterparties to the
Hedging Obligations, the Trustee and for the Holders of the Notes or, with respect to the Security
Documents governed by French law, in its capacity as parallel debt creditor pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

Each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (1) to have agreed to and accepted the terms of the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (2) to
have authorized the Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and (3) to be bound thereby. Each Holder, by accepting a
Note, appoints the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case may be, as its agent under the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and authorizes it to
act as such.

The Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, and therefore Holders may not, individually or
collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The
Holders may only act through the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable. The Security Agent will
agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents subject to and in
accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of such
Holder. The Trustee will have the ability to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action
under the Security Documents in certain circumstances. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security
Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will be entitled to exercise any and all
voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends,
non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue,
warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) in respect of the
shares that are part of the Collateral until the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement).

The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, and the
Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain
circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the
Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the_
_Collateral, and the operation of the business or the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of_
_assets securing the Notes.’’_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantors in
connection with this Offering. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral,
in whole or in part, pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents following an Acceleration
Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), would be sufficient to satisfy amounts due on the
Notes or the Notes Guarantees. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be
sold in a timely manner or at all. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral.’’_

114


-----

The Security Documents will be governed by the law of the jurisdiction to which the relevant Collateral is
subject and will provide that the rights with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be exercised
subject to the terms thereof by the Security Agent in respect of the entire outstanding amount of the
Notes. The term ‘‘Security Interests’’ refers to the Liens in the Collateral.

Under the Indenture, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to incur certain
additional Indebtedness in the future that may share in the Collateral, including Indebtedness with super
senior priority rights to proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral. The amount of such additional
Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under the captions ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
_Liens’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ Under_
certain circumstances, the amount of such additional Indebtedness that may share in the Collateral
could be significant.

**_Further Assurances_**

Each of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its respective
Subsidiaries, if any, shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such
assurances as the Security Agent may require (1) for registering any Security Document relating to the
Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the security intended to be afforded by
such Security Document relating to the Collateral; and (2) if such Security Document is enforced in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security Document and the Intercreditor
Agreement, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the assets which are subject to such Security
Document and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security
Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of the Collateral. Each of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall, and shall procure that each of its respective Subsidiaries, if any, shall, execute such
transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its
nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may request.

**_Release of the Collateral_**

The Liens over the property and other assets constituting the Collateral securing the Notes and the
Notes Guarantees will be released under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property
or assets (including Capital Stock of Subsidiaries) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture;

(2) in connection with any sale, transfer or other disposition of Capital Stock of a Guarantor or any
holding company of a Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale, transfer or other disposition does not
violate the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture and such Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of the sale, transfer or other disposition;

(3) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Guarantor;

(4) if the Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and
Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as
provided under the captions ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ and ‘‘—Satisfaction
_and Discharge’’;_

(6) as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) upon the full and final payment and performance of all financial obligations of the Issuer under the
Indenture and the Notes;

(8) in accordance with the caption ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’;

(9) in accordance with the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—No
_Impairment of Security Interest’’; and_

115


-----

(10) upon a release of the Lien that resulted in the creation of the Lien under the covenant described
under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’

The foregoing will not cause or permit, directly or indirectly, the Lien on the Capital Stock of Selecta AG to
be released, other than as expressly provided by (5), (6) and (7).

The Security Agent will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be affected by the Security Agent without the
consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to December 15, 2016 the Issuer may on any one or more occasions, upon not less than
30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes
issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to 106.50% of the principal amount of the Euro
Notes redeemed and up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the CHF Notes issued under the
Indenture at a redemption price equal to 106.50% of the principal amount of the CHF Notes redeemed, in
each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of redemption
(subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds of an Equity Offering of (i) the Issuer or (ii) any Parent
Entity to the extent the proceeds from such Equity Offering are contributed to the Issuer’s common
equity capital or are paid to the Issuer as consideration for the issuance of ordinary shares of the Issuer;
_provided that:_

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes and at least 60% of the aggregate
principal amount of the CHF Notes, originally issued under the Indenture (excluding the Notes held
by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such
redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 120 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to December 15, 2016 the Issuer may on any one or more occasions upon not less than
30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, redeem all or a part of the Euro Notes and/or CHF Notes at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable
Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date.

Except pursuant to the preceding three paragraphs and except pursuant to ‘‘—Redemption for Changes
_in Taxes,’’ the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option prior to December 15, 2016._

On or after December 15, 2016, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed on or after
the dates indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

**Redemption Price**
**Year** **Euro Notes** **CHF Notes**

December 15, 2016 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 103.250 103.250%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

Any redemption or notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

116


-----

**Redemption for Changes in Taxes**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not
less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable and
given in accordance with the procedures described in ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’), at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the date fixed by the Issuer for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) and all Additional Amounts
(if any) then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or
otherwise (subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof), if on the next date on
which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee, the Issuer under or
with respect to the Notes or any of the Guarantors with respect to any Notes Guarantee is or would be
required to pay Additional Amounts (but, in the case of the relevant Guarantor, only if such amount
cannot be paid by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can pay such amount without the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts), and the Issuer or relevant Guarantor, as applicable, cannot avoid any such
payment obligation by taking reasonable measures available (including making payment through a
Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction) and the requirement arises as a result of:

(1) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder, or
treaties of a relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the date of this
Offering Memorandum (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction on a date
after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such later date); or

(2) any amendment to, or change in, an official written interpretation or application of such laws,
regulations, rulings or treaties (including by virtue of a holding, judgment, order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice) which amendment or change has not
been publicly announced as formally proposed before and which becomes effective on or after the
date of the Offering Memorandum, (or, if the applicable Tax Jurisdiction became a Tax Jurisdiction
on a date after the date of this Offering Memorandum, such later date) (each of the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’).

The Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on
which the Issuer or the Guarantor, as applicable, would be obligated to make such payment or
withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts must be in effect (or be scheduled to come into effect on or prior to the next date on which any
amount would be payable under or in respect of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee) at the time such
notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the
Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating
that obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it; and (b) written opinion of independent tax counsel
of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the relevant Tax Jurisdiction and reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor has or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of the
Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely (without any liability on the part of the Trustee arising
from such reliance) on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel as sufficient evidence of the
existence and satisfaction of the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be
conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor
Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time
such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

117


-----

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or
any part (equal to e100,000 or integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro
Notes, and equal to CHF 150,000 or integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the
CHF Notes; provided that Euro Notes of e100,000 or less and CHF Notes of CHF 150,000 or less, may
only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment in
cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased to the date of purchase (the ‘‘Change
_of Control Payment’’), subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive_
interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes of a series as described
under ‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived,
within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice to each Holder at such
Holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described
under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to
repurchase Notes on the date (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’) specified in the notice, which
date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or
delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The
Change of Control Offer shall be open for a period of no less than 20 days, and the Issuer will comply
with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws and
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of
Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of
such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by
the Issuer.

The Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each Holder properly tendered the
Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly
authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in
principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will publicly
announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of
Control Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable.
Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions
that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a
notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption
‘‘—Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption
price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of

118


-----

Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will provide that the occurrence of a change of control would, in
each case, require the repayment of all the outstanding Indebtedness thereunder. If the Issuer
experiences a change of control that triggers a mandatory prepayment under its Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Issuer may seek the agreement of the relevant lenders thereunder to maintain the
availability of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or seek to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. Future debt of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from purchasing the
Notes in the event of a Change of Control or provide that a Change of Control is a default or require a
repurchase upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the
Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, other debt, even
if a Change of Control does not, due to the financial effect of the purchase on the Issuer.

Finally, the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer following the
occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required
purchase of the Notes. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the
_Collateral—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer.’’_

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, the ability of a Holder to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale,
lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The definition of
‘‘Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Permitted Holders’’ expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the
Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a
Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of
Control Offer in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the_
official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu).

**_Asset Sales_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at
the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity Interests
issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the
following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as recorded on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than contingent liabilities and other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee or are not otherwise permitted to be
repurchased with the Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale pursuant to the second paragraph
under this covenant), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and as a result of
which the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer obligated with respect to such
liabilities or are indemnified against further liabilities;

119


-----

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
into cash or Cash Equivalents within 120 days following the closing of the Asset Sale, to the
extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(c) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (1)(d) or (f) of the next paragraph of
this covenant;

(d) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Sales having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (d) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of e30.0 million and 2.25% of Total Assets at the time of
the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each
item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value);

(e) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Sale, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Sale; and

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor of a type set forth in
clause (1) of the following paragraph, received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary.

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Issuer (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may:

(1) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary):

(a) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer made on a pro rata basis to all of the Holders of
Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (a ‘‘Notes Offer’’);

(b) (i) to repay Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor outstanding under clause (1) of the
second paragraph of the covenant under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’ that is secured by a first-priority Lien on the_
Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Notes Guarantee
and, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness (other than in the case of a
revolving credit Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
covenant under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
_of Preferred Stock’’), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or (ii) to_
make an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below) on a pro rata basis to all Holders of the Notes and
holders of other Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral and that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Notes Guarantees;

(c) to purchase or permanently prepay or redeem or repay (i) any Indebtedness that is only
secured by Liens on assets or property that do not constitute Collateral and, if the Indebtedness
prepaid, redeemed or repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto; or (ii) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (or
any Affiliate thereof);

(d) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted
Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business
is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(e) to make a capital expenditure;

(f) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS
that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

(g) any combination of the foregoing; or

(2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to subclauses (d), (e) or (f) of
clause (1) above; provided that such commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the
Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (a) the date on which such

120


-----

acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (b) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365 day period.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary)
may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner
that is not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph
above of this covenant will constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ When the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds e25.0 million, within 20 Business Days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an
‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’) to all Holders of Notes and, to the extent notified by the Issuer in such notice, make
an offer to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Notes Guarantee to
purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, the maximum principal amount of
Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the
amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be
purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset
Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount and the offer price for any _pari passu_
Indebtedness may be no greater than 100% of the principal amount, in each case, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption,
subject to the rights of Holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash and in minimum denominations of e100,000
and in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof in the case of Euro Notes, and in minimum
denominations of CHF 150,000 and integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof in the case of CHF
Notes. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use
those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of Notes and other _pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or_
redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the
aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds
so applied, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be
purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’), based on
the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than euro or CHF, as the case may be, the amount thereof payable in respect of such
Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in euro or CHF, as the case may be, that is actually
received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Proceeds into euro or CHF, as the case
may be.

An Asset Sale Offer or a Notes Offer shall be open for a period of not less than 20 days, and the Issuer will
comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and regulations to the extent those laws
and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale
Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
the Change of Control, Asset Sale or Notes Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select such Notes for
redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form as discussed under
‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,’’ based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata
selection), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository requirements.
Neither the Trustee nor the Registrar, as applicable, shall be liable for selections made by it in
accordance with this paragraph.

No Euro Notes of e100,000 in the aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part;
_provided that Euro Notes in excess of e100,000 can be redeemed in part in integral multiples of e1,000._
No CHF Notes of CHF 150,000 in the aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part;
_provided that CHF Notes in excess of CHF 150,000 can be redeemed in part in integral multiples of_
CHF 1,000.

121


-----

Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before a
redemption date to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address, except that
redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder upon cancellation
of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to
decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Notes
called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date,
interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication
to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Notes are listed on
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market
and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, any such notice to the Holders shall also be
published in a newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the
_Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official_
website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) and, in connection with any redemption,
the Issuer will notify the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Notes
outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or
otherwise, with respect to (collectively, ‘‘incur’’) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the
Issuer will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue
any shares of preferred stock; provided, however:

(1) that the Issuer may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and
any Guarantor may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue preferred stock, if on the
date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or such preferred
stock is issued, as the case may be, the Issuer’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer’s most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available
immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.0 to
1.0; and

(2) if the Indebtedness to be incurred is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the Issuer and any Guarantor
may incur such Senior Secured Indebtedness if the Issuer’s Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Senior Secured
Indebtedness is incurred would have been less than 4.25 to 1.0,

in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or the preferred
stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of
Indebtedness (collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the incurrence by the Issuer and any Guarantor of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to exceed the
greater of (a) e65.0 million and (b) 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Issuer’s most recently
ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is incurred or, if such Credit Facilities relate to
revolving credit Indebtedness, the date on which such revolving credit Indebtedness is committed,
_plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any_

122


-----

portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs
and expenses incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) the incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other
than Additional Notes) and the related Notes Guarantees (including any future Notes Guarantees);

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date (other than
the Indebtedness described in clauses (1) or (2) of this paragraph) after giving pro forma effect to
the use of proceeds of the Notes incurred on the Issue Date;

(4) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by
Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each case,
incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of design,
construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal), plant or equipment (whether
through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets) used
in the business of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in an aggregate principal amount,
including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace,
defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (4), not to exceed the
greater of e30.0 million and 2.25% of Total Assets at any time outstanding;

(5) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing
Indebtedness in exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance,
replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was
permitted by the Indenture to be incurred under (a) the first paragraph of this covenant or
(b) clauses (2), (3), (5) or (16) of this second paragraph;

(6) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Indebtedness between or
among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that:

(a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is not the
Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly subordinated to
the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Notes, in the case of the
Issuer, or the Notes Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness
being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this
clause (6);

(7) the issuance by any Restricted Subsidiary to the Issuer or to any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of
preferred stock; provided that:

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such preferred stock
being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is neither the Issuer nor a
Restricted Subsidiary,

will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted
Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (7);

(8) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Hedging Obligations for bona fide
hedging purposes of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes;

(9) the guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred
by another provision of this covenant; _provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is_
subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Notes Guarantee, then the guarantee must be
subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness guaranteed;

(10) the incurrence by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from the
honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently
drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within ten Business Days
of such incurrence;

123


-----

(11) the incurrence by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from
agreements of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for customary indemnification,
obligations in respect of earnouts or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar
obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of
any business or assets or Person or any Equity Interests of a Subsidiary; provided that the maximum
liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness shall at no
time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of non-cash proceeds (measured
at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received
by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition (in the case of a
disposition by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries);

(12) the incurrence by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in respect of (a) letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptances, surety, performance, completion or appeal bonds, instruments,
guarantees or other obligations, judgment, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax
guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary course of business of such Person,
including letters of credit or similar instruments in respect of such obligations or in respect of
self-insurance, workers’ compensation claims or obligations, captive insurance companies and rent
payment obligations (in each case, (i) other than an obligation for borrowed money and (ii) to the
extent such obligations are reimbursed within 30 days of incurrence); and (b) any customary cash
management, cash pooling or netting or setting-off arrangements;

(13) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of Management
Advances;

(15) Indebtedness of the Issuer and any Guarantor in an aggregate outstanding principal amount that,
when taken together with any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (15) and then
outstanding, will not exceed 100% of the Net Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or
sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or an
Excluded Contribution or in connection with the contribution of proceeds of the PIK Loan) or
otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or an
Excluded Contribution or the contribution of proceeds of the PIK Loan) of the Issuer or from the
issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other
than in connection with the on-lending of proceeds of the PIK Loan); provided, however, that (a) any
such Net Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of making
Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (2), (4) and (8) of the third paragraph of
the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ to the extent the Issuer or any
Guarantor incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon; and (b) any Net Proceeds that are so received or
contributed shall be excluded for purposes of incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (15) to
the extent the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first
paragraph and clauses (2), (4) and (8) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ in reliance thereon;

(16) Indebtedness of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with
(including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness incurred to provide all or any portion of the
funds used to consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary); provided, however, with respect to this clause (16), that at the time of the
acquisition or other transaction pursuant to which such Indebtedness was deemed to be incurred
(a) the Issuer would have been able to incur e1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1)
of the first paragraph of this covenant, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (16) or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer
would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (16);

(17) Indebtedness incurred in any Qualified Securitization Financing; and

124


-----

(18) the incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness in an
aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or
discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (18), not to exceed the greater of
e40.0 million and 3.0% of Total Assets; _provided that the aggregate principal amount of such_
Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to this clause (18) by Restricted Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors shall not exceed e20.0 million.

For purposes of determining compliance with this ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Preferred Stock’’ covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one_
of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clause (1) through (18) above, or is entitled to be
incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be
permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the
date of such incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to
reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant;
_provided that Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant_
may not be reclassified. Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding on the Issue Date
will be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided in clause (1) of
the second paragraph of this covenant. The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the
form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change
in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the
form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to
be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of
this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro-Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a
different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the
case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; _provided, however, that (i) if such_
Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection
Agreement, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account
of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the Euro-Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing
Indebtedness incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the
Euro-Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was
originally incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness
incurred under a revolving credit facility, except that to the extent that:

(1) such Euro-Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in
which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding
sentence; and

(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Euro-Equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being incurred.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in
respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS;

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

125


-----

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Anti-Layering_**

Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor
unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the
applicable Notes Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness
will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different
collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall
or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the Issuer’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’
Equity Interests in their capacity as holders, other than (a) dividends or distributions payable in
Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer; and (b) dividends or distributions
payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer) any Equity Interests of the Issuer
or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer;

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or
retire for value any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or to any Notes Guarantee (excluding any intercompany
Indebtedness between or among the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (a) a
payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (b) the purchase, repurchase or
other acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case due within one year of the date
of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition;

(4) make any cash payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire
or retire for value any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment,

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (5) above being collectively
referred to as ‘‘Restricted Payments’’), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to any such Restricted
Payment:

(a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of
such Restricted Payment;

(b) the Issuer would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as
if such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period,
have been permitted to incur at least e1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio test set forth in clause (1) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the
caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’; and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments
made by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Issue Date (excluding Restricted

126


-----

Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (17) and (19) of
the third paragraph of this covenant) is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for the period (taken as one accounting
period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior to the Issue
Date to the end of the Issuer’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial
statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net
Income for such period is a deficit, less 100% of such deficit); plus

(ii) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the Fair Market Value of property or assets or
marketable securities received by the Issuer since the Issue Date as a contribution to its
common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than
Disqualified Stock or Excluded Contributions or in connection with the contribution of proceeds
of the PIK Loan) or from the issue or sale of convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock of
the Issuer or convertible or exchangeable debt securities of the Issuer, in each case that have
been converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests of the Issuer (other than Equity Interests
and convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to a Subsidiary of
the Issuer) or from the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Debt (other than an
issuance or sale to a Subsidiary of the Issuer or in respect of the contribution of proceeds of the
PIK Loan); plus

(iii) to the extent that any Restricted Investment that was made after the Issue Date is (I) sold,
disposed of or otherwise cancelled, liquidated or repaid, 100% of the aggregate amount
received in cash and the Fair Market Value of the property or assets or marketable securities
received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than from a Person that is the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary), or (II) made in an entity that subsequently becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary, 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Restricted Investment of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; plus

(iv) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer designated as such after the Issue
Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated into the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of the property received by the
Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary or the Issuer’s Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary as of
the date of such redesignation, merger, consolidation or transfer of assets, to the extent such
investments reduced the Restricted Payments capacity under this clause (iv) and were not
previously repaid or otherwise reduced; plus

(v) upon the full and unconditional release of a Restricted Investment that is a guarantee made by
the Issuer or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person, an amount equal to the amount of
such guarantee; plus

(vi) 100% of any cash dividends or distributions received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
after the Issue Date from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent that such dividends or
distributions were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of the Issuer for such
period.

The Fair Market Value of property or assets (other than cash covered by the preceding sentence) shall
be the Fair Market Value thereof as determined in good faith by an officer or the Board of Directors of the
Issuer.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any redemption within 60 days
after the date of declaration of the dividend or distribution or giving of the redemption notice, as the
case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend, distribution or redemption payment
would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds of the
substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Subsidiary of the Issuer) of, Equity
Interests of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or in respect of the contribution of the proceeds
of the PIK Loan), Subordinated Shareholder Debt or from the substantially concurrent contribution
of common equity capital to the Issuer, in each case, other than in respect of the contribution of the
proceeds of the PIK Loan; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized

127


-----

for any such Restricted Payment will be excluded from the calculation of amounts under
clause (c)(ii) of the preceding paragraph, shall not constitute Excluded Contributions, and will not
be considered to be net cash proceeds from an Equity Offering for purposes of the ‘‘Optional
_Redemption’’ provisions of the Indenture;_

(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the Note or to any
Notes Guarantee in respect thereof with the net cash proceeds from an incurrence of Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) any Restricted Payment consisting of (or the making of any Restricted Payment to fund) the
repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity Interests of any
Parent Entity, the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary held by any current or former officer, director,
employee or consultant of any Parent Entity, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant
to any equity subscription agreement, stock option agreement, restricted stock grant, shareholders’
agreement or other agreement; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased,
redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests may not exceed e5.0 million in any calendar year
(with unused amounts in any calendar year being carried over to the succeeding calendar year);
and provided, further, that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to
exceed (a) the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests or Subordinated Shareholder Debt of

such subordinated Indebtedness) with the obligations so secured until such time as such obligations are
no longer secured by a Lien and (2) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Indenture to be incurred;

of the Notes, a Notes Guarantee, or compliance by the Issuer or any Guarantor with its obligations
under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Documents and any Credit Facility;

encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material respect than those under or
pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Issuer will not directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or
not the Issuer is the surviving corporation), or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise

understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each, an
‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of e5.0 million, unless:

Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person who is not an Affiliate; and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee:

(a) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of e10.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the

transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that the

account all relevant circumstances or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to
the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any employment agreement, collective bargaining agreement or consultant or employee benefit

Holders of the Notes in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue
Date;

(11) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or
providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of business and
otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are fair to the Issuer or the Restricted
Subsidiaries, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer
or the Senior Management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable as might reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person;

(12) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax-sharing agreement between the Issuer and
any other Person or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer and any other Person with which the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries files a consolidated tax return or with which the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a group for tax purposes or any tax advantageous group

(13) any contribution to the capital of the Issuer in exchange for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than
Disqualified Stock and preferred stock);

(16) any Affiliate Transaction in connection with the Transactions as defined in the section under the
caption ‘‘Certain Definitions’’ in this Offering Memorandum; and

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly
acquired or newly formed Restricted Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the
aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an
Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’ or under one or
more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer. That designation
will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary
otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may redesignate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Issuer as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee a copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors giving effect to such
designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding
conditions and was permitted by the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted Payments.’’ If,

134


-----

at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such
date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant
described under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,’’ the Issuer
will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the Issuer may at any time designate any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to
be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is
permitted under the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
_of Preferred Stock,’’ calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning_
of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following
such designation.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof for so long
as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the
Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not so list or
maintain such listing, it will use its reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on
another ‘‘recognized stock exchange’’ as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the
United Kingdom.

**_Limitation on Issuances of Notes Guarantees of Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to
guarantee the payment of any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Restricted
Subsidiary simultaneously executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for the guarantee of the payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary, which
Notes Guarantee will be pari passu with or senior to such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such
other Indebtedness.

Each additional Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not be applicable to (1) any Notes Guarantee of Indebtedness
(other than the Revolving Credit Facility) of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date; or
(2) any guarantee given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided
profits of not less than e250 million, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at
least ‘‘A’’ or the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least ‘‘A2’’ or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in
connection with the operation of cash management programs established for the benefit of the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
guarantee the payment of the Notes to the extent that such Notes Guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in:

(1) a violation of applicable law, which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through
measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary; or

(2) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that the Issuer will procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary become a Guarantor at such_
time as such restrictions or liabilities above would no longer apply to the provision of the Notes
Guarantee or no longer would prohibit such Restricted Subsidiary from becoming a Guarantor (or
prevent the Issuer from causing such Restricted Subsidiary to become a Guarantor).

135


-----

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless
such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders that consent, waive or agree to amend
in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer
or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the
terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude Holders in any jurisdiction where (1) the
solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for
cash, or (2) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable
securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the
European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good
faith) (a) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially
burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar
documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such
jurisdiction); or (b) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such
jurisdiction.

**_No Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission would have the result of materially
impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of
Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) and the
Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other
than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that (a) nothing in this provision
shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the Indenture, the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and provided further, however, that,
subject to the foregoing clause (a) (except to the extent that such Collateral is to become subject to a
Lien following such discharge), no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified, replaced or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien
of at least equivalent ranking over the same asset) unless contemporaneously with such amendment,
extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification, renewal or release (followed by an
immediate retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same asset), the Issuer delivers to the
Trustee one of the following:

(1) a solvency opinion from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, restatement, renewal, supplement, modification, replacement or release and retaking;

(2) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the relevant Person (acting in
good faith) that confirms the solvency of the Person granting such Lien after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, replacement,
supplement, modification or release and retaking; or

(3) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary
exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release
and retaking, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified, replaced or released and retaken
are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately

136


-----

prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement
or release and retaking.

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders, the Security Agent may, subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Security Documents or enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (ii) (but subject to compliance with the first
paragraph of this covenant) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens, (iii) add to the Collateral or (iv) make
any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the Holders of Notes in any material
respect.

In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, (a) the Trustee shall (subject
to customary protections and indemnifications in the Indenture) consent to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release and (b) the Trustee shall
(subject to customary protections and indemnifications in the Indenture) instruct the Security Agent to
enter into any such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification,
replacement or release, in each case without the need for instructions from the holders. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Security Agent will have no discretion to consent to any such amendments and,
instead, it will only be obliged to execute the relevant amendment subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement if so directed by the Trustee and shall also have
the benefit of customary protections and indemnifications in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Suspension of Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date:

(1) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on such date,

then, the Issuer will notify the Trustee and beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at
which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (such period, the ‘‘Suspension Period’’), the
covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this Offering Memorandum will no longer be
applicable to the Notes and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be effective and
will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(a) ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales’’;

(b) ‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock’’;

(c) ‘‘—Restricted Payments’’;

(d) ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

(e) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale
_of Assets’’;_

(f) ‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates’’; and

(g) ‘‘—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’

Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to the actions of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Period; provided that
(A) with respect to the Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the amount of Restricted
Payments will be calculated as though the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Restricted
_Payments’’ had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period and (B) all Indebtedness_
incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified
to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the caption
‘‘—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock.’’ Upon the occurrence of a Suspension
Period, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee upon the occurrence of a Suspension Period; _provided that such_
notice will not be a precondition of the suspension of covenants described under this caption.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

137

**Reports**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
September 30, 2014, annual reports containing the following information with a level and type of

individually or in the aggregate when considered with all other acquisitions or dispositions that have
occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual
report relates, represent greater than 20% of the Issuer’s Consolidated EBITDA on a _pro forma_
basis) or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed
fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (in each case unless such pro forma information
has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); (c) an operating and
financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of
operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources, and critical accounting policies

(2) within 60 days (90 days in the case of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2014) following the end of
each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer beginning with the fiscal quarter
ending June 30, 2014, quarterly reports containing the following information: (a) an unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed
statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year to date periods ending on the
unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods for the Issuer,
together with condensed note disclosure; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet

together with explanatory notes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions (including, without

relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant
to clause (1), (2) or (3) of this covenant; (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations of the Issuer and any material change between the current year to date period and the
corresponding period of the prior year; and (d) material risk factors and material recent
developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of (a) a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring (including
any acquisition or disposition that would require the delivery of pro forma financial information
pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above); (b) any Senior Management change at the Issuer; (c) any
change in the auditors of the Issuer; (d) the entering into an agreement that will result in a Change of
Control; or (e) any material event(s) that the Issuer announces publicly, in each case, a report
containing a description of such events,

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to_
(i) contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or (ii) include separate
financial statements for any Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Subsidiaries
are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the
preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial

138


-----

statements or in the notes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except as provided for above, no
report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any
disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a
type included in this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer will, either (i) within 10 Business Days after the delivery of each report discussed in clauses (1)
and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, conduct a conference call to discuss such report and
answer questions about such report, which conference call will be open to all holders of Notes or
(ii) provide holders of Notes with access to and the opportunity to participate in any public conference
call, investor presentation, webcast or other event, the primary purpose of which is to discuss results of
operations or any material event referenced in clause (3) of the first paragraph of this covenant with
investors in the Capital Stock of the Issuer. Details of such conference calls will either (a) be delivered
with each report or (b) posted on an electronic website that is used by the Issuer to communicate to the
equity holders generally for which the holders of Notes have been, prior to the posting of such notice,
informed of the website address and relevant password specifications, which notice shall constitute
reasonable notice of such public calls for the purpose of this paragraph.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is
not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the Holders of the Notes and to securities
analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant
to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Issuer will also make
available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant
(a) on the Issuer’s website and (b) if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the specified office of the
Paying Agent in London or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such reports on
the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Indenture:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, with respect to
the Notes;

(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the principal of, or
premium, if any, on, the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with the provisions described under the caption
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets’’;

(4) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after written notice to the Issuer by the Trustee or
the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a
single class to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any of the Security Documents (other than a default in
performance, or breach, or a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in clauses (1),
(2) or (3) above);

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer, any
Guarantor, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together,
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer, any
Guarantor, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together,

139


-----

would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is
created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any on such Indebtedness at
the Stated Maturity thereof prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such
Indebtedness on the date of such default (a ‘‘Payment Default’’); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity,

and, in each case the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates e15.0 million or more;

(6) failure by the Issuer, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments entered by a court or
courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of e15.0 million (exclusive of any amounts
that a solvent insurance company has agreed in writing to pay under applicable policies), which
judgments shall not have been discharged or waived and there shall have been a period of 60
consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of an
appeal, waiver or otherwise, shall not have been in effect;

(7) (a) any security interest created by the Security Documents with respect to Collateral having a Fair
Market Value in excess of e2.5 million ceases to be in full force and effect (except as permitted by the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents), or an assertion by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that any
Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of e2.5 million is not subject to a valid, perfected
security interest (except as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement); or (b) the repudiation by the
Issuer of any of its material obligations under the Security Documents;

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, if any Notes Guarantee is held in any judicial proceeding to be
unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor, or
any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Notes
Guarantee and such Default continues for 20 days; and

(9) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

**_Remedies under the Indenture_**

In the case of an Event of Default specified in clause (9) above, all outstanding Notes will become due
and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may and, if directed by Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes, the Trustee shall, declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold
from the Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding
notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest
or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the
Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense. Except (subject to the provisions described under ‘‘—Amendment, Supplement and
_Waiver’’) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional_
Amounts when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

140


-----

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may, on
behalf of the Holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its
consequences, except a continuing default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, any
Additional Amounts or interest on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder (which may only be waived
with the consent of each Holder affected).

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will
have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture and
the Notes Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under applicable securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes
and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Notes Guarantees (‘‘Legal
_Defeasance’’) except for:_

(1) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or
interest (including Additional Amounts) or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are
due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration
of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including its obligation to make Change of
Control Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’) and
thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default
with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described
under ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies’’ (except those relating to payments on the Notes or, solely
with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default
with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Trustee
for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, cash in euros, non-callable
euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the
Euro Notes) or cash in CHF or CHF-denominated Swiss Government Obligations or a combination
thereof (in the case of the CHF Notes), in each case, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of

141


-----

an internationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public
accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts and premium, if any)
on the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption
date, as the case may be, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such
stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee of an independent U.S. tax counsel confirming that (a) the Issuer has
received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling or
(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in
either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm that, the
Holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an opinion reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee of an independent U.S. tax counsel confirming that the Holders of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made
by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the Holders of Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others;
and

(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, subject to
customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the
Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided otherwise in the succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing
Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes).

Unless consented to by the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), an amendment, supplement or waiver may not:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any such Note or alter the provisions with
respect to the redemption of such Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenants described
under the caption ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders’’);

(3) reduce the stated rate of or extend the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any
such Note;

(4) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, and interest on, such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or
with respect to such Holder’s Notes or any Notes Guarantee in respect thereof;

(5) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or
premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at

142


-----

least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the
Payment Default that resulted from such acceleration);

(6) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated in such Notes;

(7) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights
of Holders to receive payments of principal of, or interest, Additional Amounts or premium, if any, on,
the Notes;

(8) waive a redemption payment with respect to any such Note (other than a payment required by one
of the covenants described under the caption ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders’’);

(9) change the ranking of the Notes or any Notes Guarantees;

(10) release any Collateral granted for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, except in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(11) release any Guarantor from any of its Obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents or as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(12) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any amendment, waiver or other modification affects only the rights of
the Euro Notes or the CHF Notes, as applicable, the Holders of the other series of Notes shall not be
required to consent thereto (and in such case, only the consent of a majority or 90%, as the case may be,
in aggregate principal amount of the affected series of Notes shall be required to consent thereto). For
the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that any matter described in the preceding
paragraphs that by its terms applies only to the Euro Notes or the CHF Notes shall not be deemed to
affect the rights of, or require the consent of, the Holders of the other series of Notes and shall require
only the consent of a majority or 90% of the Holders of the Euro Notes or the CHF Notes, as the case may
be.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent (as applicable and to the extent each is a party to the relevant document) and the other parties
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein;

(2) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, however,
that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code);

(3) provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to Holders under the Notes
and Notes Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not
adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder in any material respect;

(5) conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees to
any provision of this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description
_of the Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security_
Documents, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees;

(6) enter into additional or supplemental Security Documents;

(7) release any Notes Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) release the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(9) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the
Indenture as of the Issue Date;

(10) allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Notes Guarantee with respect to
the Notes; or

143


-----

(11) evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or the Security
Agent under the Indenture or evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a Security
Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or any Security
Document.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including an opinion of counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

**Additional or Amended Intercreditor Agreement**

At the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence of any Indebtedness that is permitted
to share the Collateral or that is otherwise permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the Issuer and
the Security Agent will, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (without the consent of the
Holders) enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’)

or an amendment to or an amendment and restatement of the Intercreditor Agreement (which
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of the Holders); _provided that such Intercreditor_

Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the
Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,

or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of each Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to become a party to any such
Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreement, and any amendment referred to in the
preceding paragraph and the Trustee or the Security Agent will not be required to seek the consent of
any Holders to perform its obligations under and in accordance with this covenant.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder
when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been previously authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has

144


-----

been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer, have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become
due and payable by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become
due and payable within one year and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee or an Agent selected by the Trustee for such purpose
as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the Holders (i) cash in euros, non-callable
euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of
the Euro Notes) or (ii) cash in CHF or CHF-denominated Swiss Government Obligations or a
combination thereof (in the case of the CHF Notes), in each case, in amounts as will be
sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium
and Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the
Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied; provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with
the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in CHF or euro, as the case may be, which is
made to or for the account of any Holder or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the
‘‘Judgment Currency’’), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the
liquidation of the Issuer or any Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer or the Guarantor’s
obligation under the Indenture, the Notes and the Notes Guarantee, as the case may be, only to the
extent of the amount of CHF or euro, as the case may be, that such Holder or the Trustee, as the case
may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment
Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first
Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of CHF or euro,
as the case may be, that could be so purchased is less than the amount of CHF or euro, as the case may
be, originally due to such Holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Holder or the Trustee, as the case may be, from and against all loss or
damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation
separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Indenture or the Notes, shall give
rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by
any Holder or the Trustee from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any
judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or
order.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within 30 days of becoming aware of the occurrence
of a Default or an Event of Default. If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the
Indenture limits the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be
permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting, in its capacity as
Trustee, interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign as Trustee.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right
to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available
to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of
care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be

145


-----

under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any
Holder, unless such Holder has offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the Trustee for certain claims, liabilities and expenses
incurred without fraud, negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its
duties.

‘‘Specified Change of Control Event’’ means the occurrence of any event that would constitute a Change
of Control pursuant to the definition thereof; provided that immediately prior to the occurrence of such
event and immediately thereafter and giving pro forma effect thereto, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of
the Issuer would have been less than (a) prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Issue Date, 4.25 to 1.0;
(b) on or after the 12-month anniversary and prior to the 24-month anniversary of the Issue Date, 4.00 to

security, instrument or agreement other than Capital Stock, together with any such security, instrument
or agreement and any other security or instrument other than Capital Stock issued in payment of any

the Notes mature other than into or for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer,

_provided, however, that any event or circumstance that results in such Indebtedness ceasing to qualify_
as Subordinated Shareholder Debt, such Indebtedness shall constitute an incurrence of such
Indebtedness by the Issuer, and any and all Restricted Payments made through the use of the net
proceeds from the incurrence of such Indebtedness since the date of the original issuance of such
Subordinated Shareholder Debt shall constitute new Restricted Payments that are deemed to have been

Person is a controlling general partner or otherwise controls such entity.

‘‘Swiss Government Bond Rate’’ means the yield to maturity at the time of computation of direct
obligations of the Swiss Confederation (Staatsanleihen) with a constant maturity (as officially compiled
and published in the most recent financial statistics that has become publicly available at least two
Business days (but not more than five Business Days) prior to the redemption date (or, if such financial
statistics are not so published or available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected
by the Issuer in good faith)) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to December 15,
2016; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to December 15, 2016 is not equal
to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Swiss Confederation for which a weekly average
yield is given, the Swiss Government Bond Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to
the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations of the Swiss
Confederation for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such redemption date to
December 15, 2016 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct obligations
of the Swiss Confederation adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

‘‘Swiss Government Obligations’’ means direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed by, the Swiss
Confederation (Staatsanleihen), and the payment for which the Swiss Confederation pledges its full faith
and credit; provided that the Swiss Confederation has a long term government debt rating of ‘‘A1’’ or
higher by Moody’s or ‘‘A+’’ or higher by S&P or the equivalent rating category of another internationally
recognized rating agency.

‘‘Tax’’ means any tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge (including penalties,
interest and any other additions thereto, and, for the avoidance of doubt, including any withholding or
deduction for or on account of Tax). ‘‘Taxes’’ and ‘‘Taxation’’ shall be construed to have corresponding
meanings.

‘‘Total Assets’’ means the consolidated total assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
calculated in accordance with IFRS, as shown on the most recent balance sheet of the Issuer for which
internal financial statements are available (excluding the notes thereto).

‘‘U.S. Exchange Act’’ means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ means any Subsidiary of the Issuer that is designated by the Board of

but only to the extent that such Subsidiary:

(1) has no Indebtedness other than Non-Recourse Debt;

(2) except as permitted by the covenant described under the caption ‘‘—Certain Covenants—
_Transactions with Affiliates,’’ is not party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding_
with the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary unless the terms of any such agreement, contract,
arrangement or understanding are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary than
those that might be obtained at the time from Persons who are not Affiliates of the Issuer; and

(3) is a Person with respect to which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any direct or
indirect obligation (a) to subscribe for additional Equity Interests or (b) to maintain or preserve such
Person’s financial condition or to cause such Person to achieve any specified levels of operating
results.

‘‘Voting Stock’’ of any specified Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of such Person that is at
the time entitled to vote in the election of the Board of Directors of such Person.

sinking fund, serial maturity or other required payments of principal, including payment at final
maturity, in respect of the Indebtedness, by (b) the number of years (calculated to the nearest
one-twelfth) that will elapse between such date and the making of such payment; by

(2) the then outstanding principal amounts of such Indebtedness.

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Certain defined terms used but not defined in this section have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture as described in ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’

Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Global Note’’). Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United
States in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Global Note’’ and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global
**Notes’’). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depositary and**
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the account of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Ownership of beneficial interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (‘‘Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-Entry Interests’’ and,
together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such
participants and must be in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set out in the Indenture and
in any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or of any other jurisdiction, as
described under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes
on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the
books of their respective depositories.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, owners of Book-Entry Interests will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes in
registered form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’). Instead, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit on their
respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest
beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities
in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be
considered the owners or ‘‘holders’’ of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominee), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests
or to exercise any rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

The Euro Notes will be issued in denominations of e100,000 and in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess
thereof. The CHF Notes will be issued in denominations of CHF150,000 and in integral multiples of
CHF1,000 in excess thereof.

Neither of the Issuer nor the Trustee or any agent will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect
of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
its respective nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such
Global Note from the amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal
to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption
of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under the existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit its participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent

171


-----

fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate unless otherwise required by law or
applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the relevant Global Notes (including
principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and
Clearstream. Euroclear or Clearstream will distribute such payments to or to the order of participants in
accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of all such amounts free
and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and
as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.’’ If any such deduction or
withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts’’ above, as the case may be, the Issuer will pay such Additional Amounts as may be_
necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by any holder of the relevant Global Notes or owner
of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding are not less than the net amounts that such
holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as
the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuer expects that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant Agents will treat the registered
holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream)
as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective Agents has or will have any responsibility or
liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of the Notes
will be paid to holders of Book-Entry Interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of a Note (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the
direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such
participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise
any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream, at
the request of the holders of such Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants, as described in
‘‘—Definitive Registered Notes.’’

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of a Note requires

172


-----

physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in
states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes
must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will each bear a legend to the effect set forth under ‘‘Offering and Transfer
_Restrictions.’’ Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and_
certification requirements discussed under ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S
or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities
Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions’’ and in accordance with any applicable securities
laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A
Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange’’ if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the relevant Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
Notes. See ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered
Notes:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under and as defined in the Indenture and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indenture.

In any such events described in clauses (1) or (2), the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes,
registered in the name or names of holders and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or
on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary
procedures and certain certification requirements and based upon directions received from participants
reflecting the beneficial ownership of the Book-Entry Interests). The Definitive Registered Notes will bear
a restrictive legend with respect to certain transfer restrictions, unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture governing the Notes or by applicable law.

173


-----

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such note by surrendering it to the registrar or a transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or
a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered
Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a
new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will
be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will
only be issued in a denomination of e100,000 or in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof, in the
case of the Euro Notes, and CHF 150,000 or in integral multiples of CHF 1,000 in excess thereof, in the
case of the CHF Notes. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the
Definitive Registered Notes.

The Issuer will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any
date fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in
part. Also, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for
redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
change of control offer or asset sale offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note,
the trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents as described in the Indenture. The Issuer may require a holder to pay any transfer taxes and
fees required by law and permitted by the Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such a Definitive Registered
Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and
is surrendered to the registrar or at the office of a transfer agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee will
authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are
met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered
Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both to protect themselves, the Trustee or
the paying agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a
Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by the Issuer in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only in accordance with the Indenture
and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant Agents will treat the registered
holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the
registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from
time to time at the registered office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the
Notes.

The Issuer will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, holders of the
Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of
accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Issuer will
publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation
in Luxembourg (which is currently expected to be the Luxemburger Wort). Payment of principal, any
repurchase price, premium and interest on Definitive Registered Notes will be payable at the office of the
paying agent so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the

174


-----

settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers
are responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and
Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF. Transfers of interests in the
Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee or the Agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value of the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice_
_currently applicable in the European Union, the United States and the Netherlands and does not purport_
_to address the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject_
_to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of_
_interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The summaries set forth below are based upon, as applicable, European Union, Dutch or United States_
_law as in effect on the date of this offering memorandum and are subject to any change in such law that_
_may take effect after such date. References in this section to holders of the Notes include the beneficial_
_owners of the Notes. Terms defined under each subsection related to European Union, Dutch and United_
_States tax law below only have such meanings as defined therein for such respective section. The_
_statements regarding the Dutch and United States laws and practices set forth below assume that the_
_Notes will be issued, and the transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the Indenture._

**European Union Directive on the Taxation of Savings Income**

On June 3, 2003, the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted the European Union
Savings Directive (Council Directive 2003/48/EC) effective from July 1, 2005 (the ‘‘Directive’’). Under the
Directive, Member States are required to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of
certain payments of interest or similar income paid or secured by a person established in a Member
State to or for the benefit of an individual resident in another Member State or certain limited types of
entities established in another Member State.

On March 24, 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a Council Directive amending and
broadening the scope of the requirements described above. Member States are required to apply these
new requirements from January 1, 2017. The changes will expand the range of payments covered by the
Directive, in particular to include additional types of income payable on securities. The Directive will also
expand the circumstances in which payments that indirectly benefit an individual resident in a Member
State must be reported. This approach will apply to payments made to, or secured for, persons, entities
or legal arrangements (including trusts) where certain conditions are satisfied, and may in some cases
apply where the person, entity or arrangement is established or effectively managed outside of the
European Union.

For a transitional period, Luxembourg and Austria are required (unless during that period they elect
otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments. The changes referred to above
will broaden the types of payments subject to withholding in those Member States which still operate a
withholding system when they are implemented. In April 2013, the Luxembourg Government announced
its intention to abolish the withholding system with effect from January 1, 2015, in favor of automatic
information exchange under the Directive.

The end of the transitional period is dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating
to information exchange with certain other countries. A number of non-EU countries and territories
including Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

**TO COMPLY WITH IRS CIRCULAR 230, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED**
**THAT: (A) ANY DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES CONTAINED OR REFERRED TO IN**
**THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM IS NOT INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE**
**USED BY INVESTORS, FOR THE PURPOSES OF AVOIDING PENALTIES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED**
**ON THEM UNDER THE CODE; (B) SUCH DISCUSSION IS BEING USED IN CONNECTION WITH**
**THE PROMOTION AND MARKETING BY THE ISSUER AND INITIAL PURCHASERS OF THE**
**TRANSACTIONS OR MATTERS ADDRESSED HEREIN; AND (C) PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS**
**SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN**
**INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR.**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport

176


-----

to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The summary is limited to considerations relevant to
a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except to the extent discussed in ‘‘—Foreign Account Tax
_Compliance,’’ and does not address the effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax_
laws, and any applicable state, local or foreign tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may
change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be
applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought
and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no
assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as ‘‘capital assets’’ within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited
to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original ‘‘issue price’’ within the
meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Euro Notes
and the CHF Notes, as the case may be, is sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not address
all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the
impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address
consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:

- U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

- persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

- U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a
conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

- banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

- real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

- brokers, dealers or traders in securities;

- ‘‘controlled foreign corporations,’’ ‘‘passive foreign investment companies,’’ and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

- S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (and investors therein);

- tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; and

- persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is or is treated as:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District
of Columbia;

- an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

- a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more
‘‘United States persons’’ (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has a valid
election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the
partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding the
Notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences to them.

**THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.**
**INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION**
**OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS**
**ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE**
**NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT TAX**
**LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR**
**UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.**

**_Payments of Qualified Stated Interest_**

Payments of qualified stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of
withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S.
Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with
such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Qualified stated interest
generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than debt
instruments of the issuer) at least annually at a single fixed rate. The stated interest on the Euro Notes
and the CHF Notes will qualify as ‘‘qualified stated interest.’’

A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of qualified stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro or Swiss franc interest payment (determined based on
the spot rate on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign currency
gain or loss on the receipt of such qualified stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss
attributable to the actual disposition of the euro or Swiss francs received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be
required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of qualified stated
interest income in euro or Swiss francs that has accrued with respect to the Notes during an accrual
period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro or Swiss franc denominated accrued qualified stated interest
will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate for the accrual period or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period
within each taxable year. An accrual method U.S. Holder may elect to translate such accrued qualified
stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate on the last day of the interest accrual period
or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate on the last day of
the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of
receipt of the accrued qualified stated interest, a U.S. Holder that has made the election described in the
prior sentence may translate such interest using the spot rate on the date of receipt of the qualified stated
interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. Holder and may
not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect
to accrued qualified stated interest on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or
loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro or Swiss franc
payment received (determined based on the spot rate on the date such qualified stated interest is
received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of qualified stated interest income
that has accrued during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment
is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute
ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss,
and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Qualified stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally
will be considered ‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S.
Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s
ability to claim foreign tax credits. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

178


-----

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid qualified stated
interest, which will be taxable to the extent not previously included in income as described above under
‘‘—Payments of Qualified Stated Interest’’) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of cash plus the fair market value of all other property
received on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on a sale or
other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized will be translated into U.S. dollars based on the
spot rate on the date of disposition. If the Notes are traded on an established securities market, a cash
basis U.S. Holder and an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of such
foreign currency based on the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual
basis U.S. Holder makes this election, the election must be applied consistently by such holder from
year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. If the Notes are not traded on an
established securities market (or, if the Notes are so traded, but an accrual basis U.S. Holder has not
made the settlement date election), a U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss
(as ordinary income or loss) to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received
(based on the spot rate on the date of settlement) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized
(based on the spot rate on the date of disposition).

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be its cost for the Note, reduced by any cash
payments received on the Note (other than qualified stated interest). The cost of a Note purchased with
foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price determined based on the spot rate on
the date of purchase.

A U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss)
on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar
value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price of the Note on (i) the date of sale or other taxable disposition
and (ii) the date on which the U.S. Holder acquired the Note. In addition, upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to
amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid qualified stated interest, which will be treated as
discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Qualified Stated Interest.’’ Any such foreign currency exchange
gain or loss (including any exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest) will be realized only to
the extent of the total gain or loss realized on the sale or other taxable disposition by a U.S. Holder, and
will generally be treated as U.S. source income or loss.

Gain or loss in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale or
other taxable disposition of the Notes generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss
generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the Notes for more than one year.
For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are generally eligible for reduced rates of
taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder should consult its own
tax advisor regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its particular circumstances.

**_Disposition of Foreign Currency_**

A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in any euro or Swiss francs received as payment of stated interest or
any foreign currency received upon the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note equal to the U.S. dollar
value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt of such foreign currency. Any gain or loss
realized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition of such foreign currency, including their
exchange for U.S. dollars, will be ordinary income or loss generally not treated as interest income or
expense and generally will be U.S. source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the Notes and to the
proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note paid to a U.S.
Holder, unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, provides evidence of such
exemption. A U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to U.S. federal backup
withholding at the applicable rate (currently 28%) with respect to payments on the Notes and the
proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes, unless the U.S. Holder provides its taxpayer

179


-----

identification number to the paying agent and certifies on IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that it
is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup
withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder may be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided the required
information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax
shelter transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain
foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000
in the case of an individual or trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any,
with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals that own ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’ with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on
the last day of the tax year or more than $75,000 at any time during the tax year (or such larger values as
specified in applicable Treasury Regulations), generally are required to file an information report with
respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign
financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at a
U.S. financial institution.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as ‘‘FATCA’’), a
‘‘foreign financial institution’’ may be required to withhold U.S. tax on payments on certain debt
instruments and the gross proceeds from the disposition of such debt instruments. However, the
application of these rules is not clear. If the Issuer were treated as a foreign financial institution, debt
instruments issued by it on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final
Treasury regulations are filed, generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ from FATCA unless ‘‘materially
modified’’ (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) after such date. Non-U.S. governments have entered
into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into
such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders
should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In
the event any withholding under FATCA is required or advisable with respect to any payments on the
Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain Dutch Tax Considerations**

**_General_**

The following is a general summary of certain Dutch tax considerations of the acquisition, holding and
disposal of the Notes. This summary does not purport to describe all possible tax considerations or
consequences that may be relevant to a holder or prospective holder of Notes and does not purport to
deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as trusts or
similar arrangements) may be subject to special rules. In view of its general nature, it should be treated
with corresponding caution. Holders or prospective holders of Notes should consult with their tax
advisors with regard to the tax consequences of investing in the Notes in their particular circumstances.
The discussion below is included for general information purposes only.

Except as otherwise indicated, this summary only addresses Dutch national tax legislation and
published regulations, whereby the terms ‘‘Dutch’’ and ‘‘the Netherlands’’ refer solely to the part of the
Kingdom of the Netherlands located in Europe, as in effect on the date hereof and as interpreted in
published case law until this date, without prejudice to any amendment introduced at a later date and
implemented with or without retroactive effect.

180


-----

**_Withholding tax_**

All payments of principal and/or interest made by the Issuer under the Notes may be made free of
withholding or deduction of, for or on account of any taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld
or assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

**_Taxes on income and capital gains_**

Please note that the summary in this section does not describe the Dutch tax consequences for:

(i) holders of Notes if such holders, and in the case of individuals, his/her partner or certain of their
relatives by blood or marriage in the direct line (including foster children), have a substantial interest
or deemed substantial interest in the Issuer under the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet
_inkomstenbelasting 2001). Generally speaking, a holder of securities in a company is considered to_
hold a substantial interest in such company, if such holder alone or, in the case of individuals,
together with his/her partner (as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001), directly or indirectly,
holds (i) an interest of 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of that company or of
5% or more of the issued and outstanding capital of a certain class of shares of that company; or
(ii) rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such interest; or (iii) certain profit sharing rights in that
company that relate to 5% or more of the company’s annual profits and/or to 5% or more of the
company’s liquidation proceeds. A deemed substantial interest may arise if a substantial interest (or
part thereof) in a company has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, on a
non-recognition basis;

(ii) pension funds, investment institutions (fiscale beleggingsinstellingen), exempt investment
institutions (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstellingen) (as defined in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act
1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969)) and other entities that are, in whole or in part, not
subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax; and

(iii) holders of Notes who are individuals for whom the Notes or any benefit derived from the Notes are a
remuneration or deemed to be a remuneration for activities performed by such holders or certain
individuals related to such holders (as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001).

_Residents of the Netherlands_

Generally speaking, if the holder of Notes is an entity that is a resident or deemed to be resident of the
Netherlands for Dutch corporate income tax purposes, any payment under the Notes or any gain or loss
realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the Notes is subject to Dutch corporate income tax at a
rate of 20% with respect to taxable profits up to e200,000 and 25% with respect to taxable profits in
excess of that amount.

If a holder of Notes is an individual, resident or deemed to be resident of the Netherlands for Dutch
income tax purposes (including the non-resident individual holder who has made an election for the
application of the rules of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 as they apply to residents of the Netherlands),
any payment under the Notes or any gain or loss realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the
Notes is taxable at the progressive income tax rates (with a maximum of 52%), if:

(i) the Notes are attributable to an enterprise from which the holder of Notes derives a share of the
profit, whether as an entrepreneur or as a person who has a co-entitlement to the net worth
(medegerechtigd tot het vermogen) of such enterprise without being a shareholder (as defined in
the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001); or

(ii) the holder of Notes is considered to perform activities with respect to the Notes that go beyond
ordinary asset management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) or derives benefits from the Notes
that are taxable as benefits from other activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden).

If the abovementioned conditions (i) and (ii) do not apply to the individual holder of Notes, such holder
will be taxed annually on a deemed income of 4% of his/her net investment assets for the year at an
income tax rate of 30%. The net investment assets for the year are the fair market value of the investment
assets less the allowable liabilities on January 1 of the relevant calendar year. The Notes are included as
investment assets. A tax free allowance may be available. Actual income, gains or losses in respect of
the Notes are not subject to Dutch income tax.

181


-----

_Non-residents of the Netherlands_

A holder of Notes that is neither resident nor deemed to be resident of the Netherlands nor has made an
election for the application of the rules of the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 as they apply to residents of the
Netherlands will not be subject to Dutch taxes on income or capital gains in respect of any payment
under the Notes or in respect of any gain or loss realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the
Notes, provided that:

(i) such holder does not have an interest in an enterprise or deemed enterprise (as defined in the Dutch
Income Tax Act 2001 and the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969) which, in whole or in part, is
either effectively managed in the Netherlands or carried on through a permanent establishment, a
deemed permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands and to which
enterprise or part of an enterprise the Notes are attributable; and

(ii) in the event the holder is an individual, such holder does not carry out any activities in the
Netherlands with respect to the Notes that go beyond ordinary asset management and does not
derive benefits from the Notes that are taxable as benefits from other activities in the Netherlands.

**Gift and inheritance taxes**

_Residents of the Netherlands_

Gift or inheritance taxes will arise in the Netherlands with respect to a transfer of the Notes by way of a gift
by, or on the death of, a holder of such Notes who is resident or deemed resident of the Netherlands at
the time of the gift or his/her death.

_Non-residents of the Netherlands_

No Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will arise on the transfer of Notes by way of gift by, or on the death of, a
holder of Notes who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, unless:

(i) in the case of a gift of a Note by an individual who at the date of the gift was neither resident nor
deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such individual dies within 180 days after the date of the
gift, while being resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands; or

(ii) the transfer is otherwise construed as a gift or inheritance made by, or on behalf of, a person who, at
the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands.

For purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance taxes, amongst others, a person that holds the Dutch
nationality will be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands if such person has been resident in the
Netherlands at any time during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his/her death. Additionally,
for purposes of Dutch gift tax, amongst others, a person not holding the Dutch nationality will be deemed
to be resident in the Netherlands if such person has been resident in the Netherlands at any time during
the twelve months preceding the date of the gift. Applicable tax treaties may override deemed residency.

**Value added tax (‘‘VAT’’)**

No Dutch VAT will be payable by the holders of the Notes on (i) any payment in consideration for the
issue of the Notes or (ii) the payment of interest or principal by the Issuer under the Notes.

**Other documentary taxes and duties**

No Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty will be payable by the
holders of the Notes in respect of (i) the issue of the Notes or (ii) the payment of interest or principal by
the Issuer under the Notes.

**Certain Swiss tax considerations**

_The following discussion is a summary of certain material Swiss tax considerations relating to (i) Notes_
_where the Holder is tax resident in Switzerland or has a tax presence in Switzerland or (ii) Notes where the_
_Paying Agent, custodian or securities dealer is located in Switzerland. The discussion is based on_
_legislation as of the date of this offering memorandum. It does not aim to be a comprehensive description_
_of all the Swiss tax considerations that may be relevant for a decision to invest in Notes. The tax treatment_
_for each investor depends on the particular situation. All investors are advised to consult with their_
_professional tax advisors as to the respective Swiss tax consequences of the purchase, ownership,_

182


-----

_disposition, lapse, exercise or redemption of Notes (or options embedded therein) in light of their_
_particular circumstances._

**_Swiss Federal Withholding Tax_**

Payments by the Issuer, of interest on, and repayment of principal of, the Notes, will not be subject to
Swiss federal withholding tax, provided that the Issuer is at all times resident and managed outside
Switzerland for Swiss tax purposes.

On August 24, 2011, the Swiss Federal Council issued draft legislation, which, if enacted, may require a
paying agent in Switzerland to deduct Swiss withholding tax at a rate of 35% on any payment of interest
in respect of a debt security to an individual resident in Switzerland or to a person resident outside of
Switzerland. If this legislation or similar legislation were enacted and an amount of, or in respect of, Swiss
withholding tax were to be deducted or withheld from that payment, it is possible that neither the Issuer
nor any paying agent nor any other person would pursuant to the terms of the Notes be obliged to pay
additional amounts with respect to any debt security as a result of the deduction or imposition of such
withholding tax.

**_Swiss Federal Stamp Taxes_**

The issue and redemption of Notes by the Issuer are not subject to Swiss federal stamp duty on the issue
of securities. Purchases or sales of Notes with a maturity in excess of 12 months where a Swiss domestic
bank or a Swiss domestic securities dealer (as defined in the Swiss federal stamp duty act) is a party, or
acts as an intermediary, to the transaction may be subject to Swiss federal stamp duty on dealings in
securities at a rate of up to 0.3% of the purchase price of the Notes. Where both the seller and the
purchaser of the Notes are non-residents of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein, no Swiss
federal stamp duty on dealing in securities is payable.

**_Income Taxation on Principal or Interest_**

_Notes held by non-Swiss holders_

Payments by the Issuer of interest and repayment of principal to, and gain realized on the sale or
redemption of Notes by, a holder of Notes who is not a resident of Switzerland and who during the
relevant taxation year has not engaged in a trade or business through a permanent establishment or a
fixed place of business in Switzerland to which the Notes are attributable and who is not subject to
income taxation in Switzerland for any other reason will not be subject to any Swiss federal, cantonal or
communal income tax.

_Notes held by Swiss holders as private assets_

_Notes without a ‘‘predominant one-time interest payment’’:_ An individual who resides in Switzerland
and privately holds a Note the yield-to-maturity of which predominantly derives from periodic interest
payments and not from a one-time-interest-payment such as an original issue discount or a repayment
premium, is required to include all payments of interest received on such Note in his or her personal
income tax return for the relevant tax period and is taxable on the net taxable income (including the
payment of interest on the Note) for such tax period at the then prevailing tax rates.

_Notes with a ‘‘predominant one-time interest payment’’:_ An individual who resides in Switzerland and
privately holds a Note the yield-to-maturity of which predominantly derives from a one-time-interestpayment such as an original issue discount or a repayment premium and not from periodic interest
payments, is required to include in his or her personal income tax return for the relevant tax period any
periodic interest payments received on the Note and, in addition, any amount equal to the difference
between the value of the Note at redemption or sale, as applicable, and the value of the Note at issuance
or secondary market purchase, as applicable, realized on the sale or redemption of such Note, and
converted into Swiss Francs at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of sale or redemption, issuance
or purchase, respectively, and will be taxable on any net taxable income (including such amounts) for
the relevant tax period. A holder of a Note may offset any value decrease realized by him or her on such a
Note on sale or redemption against any gains (including periodic interest payments) realized by him or
her within the same taxation period on the sale or redemption of other debt securities with a predominant
one-time interest payment.

183


-----

_Capital gains and losses:_ Swiss resident individuals who sell or otherwise dispose of privately held
Notes realize either a tax-free private capital gain or a non-tax-deductible capital loss. See the preceding
paragraph for a summary of the tax treatment of a gain or a loss realized on Notes with a ‘‘predominant
one-time interest payment.’’ See ‘‘Notes held as Swiss business assets’’ below for a summary on the tax
treatment of individuals classified as ‘‘professional securities dealers.’’

_Notes held as Swiss business assets_

Individuals who hold Notes as part of a business in Switzerland and Swiss-resident corporate taxpayers
and corporate taxpayers residing abroad holding Notes as part of a permanent establishment or fixed
place of business in Switzerland are required to recognize the payments of interest and any capital gain
or loss realized on the sale or other disposition of such Notes in their income statement for the respective
tax period and will be taxable on any net taxable earnings for such tax period. The same taxation
treatment also applies to Swiss-resident individuals who, for income tax purposes, are classified as
‘‘professional securities dealers’’ for reasons of, inter alia, frequent dealings and leveraged transactions
in securities.

**_Taxes withheld by Switzerland for other countries_**

_European Savings Tax_

On October 26, 2004, the European Community and Switzerland entered into an agreement on the
taxation of savings income pursuant to which Switzerland will adopt measures equivalent to those of the
European Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest
payments. The agreement came into force as of July 1, 2005.

In accordance with this agreement respectively the Swiss law implementing this agreement, Swiss
paying agents have to withhold tax at a rate of 35% on interest payments made under the bonds to a
beneficial owner who is an individual and resident of an EU member state, with the option of the
individual to have the paying agent and Switzerland provide to the tax authorities of the EU member state
the details of the interest payments in lieu of the withholding.

_Foreign Final Withholding Tax_

The Swiss Federal Council recently signed treaties with the United Kingdom and Austria providing, inter
alia, for a final withholding tax. The treaties entered into force on January 1, 2013 and might be followed
by similar treaties with other European countries.

According to the treaties, a Swiss paying agent may levy a final withholding tax on capital gains and on
certain income items deriving, inter alia, from Notes. The final withholding tax will substitute the ordinary
income tax due by an individual resident of a contracting state on such gains and income items. In lieu of
the final withholding, individuals may opt for a voluntary disclosure of the relevant capital gains and
income items to the tax authorities of their state of residency.

Holders of Notes who might be in the scope of the abovementioned treaties should consult their own tax
advisor as to the tax consequences relating to their particular circumstances.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

Unless otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, the Notes should be eligible
for purchase by employee benefit plans and other plans subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’), and/or the provisions of Section 4975
of the Code and by governmental, church and non-U.S. plans that are subject to state, local, other
federal law of the United States or non-U.S. law that is substantially similar to ERISA or the Code
(‘‘Similar Law’’) subject to consideration of the issues described in this section. ERISA imposes certain
requirements on ‘‘employee benefit plans’’ (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to ERISA,
including entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets
include the assets of such plans (collectively, ‘‘ERISA Plans’’), and on those persons who are fiduciaries
with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary
requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the
requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing
the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible
fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the
facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed under
‘‘Risk Factors.’’

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of
an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975
of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts (together with ERISA Plans, the ‘‘Plans’’)) and
certain persons (referred to as ‘‘parties in interest’’ or ‘‘disqualified persons’’) having certain
relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the
transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person, including a Plan fiduciary, who engages in a
prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and
the Code.

The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the transfer agent, the registrar, the Initial
Purchasers or any other party to the transactions referred to in this offering memorandum may be parties
in interest or disqualified persons with respect to many Plans. Prohibited transactions within the meaning
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if any of the Notes is acquired or held by a
Plan, including but not limited to where the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
transfer agent, the registrar, the Initial Purchasers or any other party to such transactions is a party in
interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on
the type of Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire any Notes and the circumstances under which
such decision is made. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code (relating to transactions between a person that is a party in interest
(other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders
investment advice with respect to assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing
services to the plan, provided that there is adequate consideration for the transaction), Prohibited
Transaction Class Exemption (‘‘PTCE’’) 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment
funds), PTCE 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a qualified professional asset manager),
PTCE 95-60 (relating to transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 90-1
(relating to investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (relating to
transactions determined by in-house asset managers). Prospective investors should consult with their
advisors regarding the prohibited transaction rules and these exceptions. There can be no assurance
that any of these exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving any Notes.

Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject
to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Law. Fiduciaries of any
such plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the Notes to determine the need for, if
necessary, and the availability of, any exemptive relief under any Similar Law.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated a regulation, 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101,
as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the ‘‘Plan Asset Regulation’’), describing what constitutes the
assets of a Plan with respect to the Plan’s investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of

185


-----

ERISA, including the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA, and Section 4975 of the Code.
Under the Plan Asset Regulation, if a Plan invests in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a
publicly-offered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the United
States Investment Company Act of 1940, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an
undivided interest in each of the entity’s underlying assets, unless one of the exceptions to such
treatment described in the Plan Asset Regulation applies. Under the Plan Asset Regulation, a security
which is in the form of debt may be considered an equity interest if it has substantial equity features. If the
Group was deemed under the Plan Asset Regulation to hold plan assets by reason of a Plan’s
investment in any of the Notes, such plan assets would include an undivided interest in the assets held
by the Group and transactions by the Group would be subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of
Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. The
Plan Asset Regulation provides, however, that if equity participation in any entity by ‘‘Benefit Plan
Investors’’ is not significant, then the ‘‘look-through’’ rule will not apply to such entity. The term ‘‘Benefit
Plan Investors’’ is defined in the Plan Asset Regulation to include (1) any employee benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) subject to Title I of ERISA, (2) any plan described in Section 4975(e)(1)
of the Code, and (3) any entity whose underlying assets include ‘‘plan assets’’ by reason of any such
employee benefit plan or plan’s investment in the entity. Equity participation by Benefit Plan Investors in
any entity is significant if, immediately after the most recent acquisition of any equity interest in the entity,
25% or more of the value of any class of equity interests in the entity (excluding the value of any interests
held by certain persons, other than Benefit Plan Investors, exercising control over the assets of the entity
or providing investment advice to the entity for a fee or any affiliates of such persons) is held by Benefit
Plan Investors. If, as a result of any investment, 25% or more of the value of any class of equity interests in
the Issuer is being held by Benefit Plan Investors, the applicable Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer.
While there is little pertinent authority in this area and no assurance can be given, the Issuer believes that
the Notes should not be treated as equity interests for the purposes of the Plan Asset Regulation and,
therefore, the Plan Asset Regulation should not apply and any such redemptions would not be
necessary.

Accordingly, except as otherwise provided in any supplement to this offering memorandum, each
purchaser and subsequent transferee of any Notes will represent and warrant, on each day from the date
on which the purchaser or transferee acquires such Notes (or any interest therein) through and including
the date on which the purchaser or transferee disposes of such Notes (or any interest therein), either that
(a) it is not a Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include, or are deemed for purposes of ERISA or
the Code to include, the assets of any Plan or a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject
to any Similar Law or (b) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes (or any interest therein)
will not constitute or result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan subject to Similar Law, a violation of any
Similar Law) for which an exemption is not available.

Each Plan fiduciary who is responsible for making the investment decisions whether to purchase or
commit to purchase and to hold any of the Notes should determine whether, under the documents and
instruments governing the Plan, an investment in such Notes is appropriate for the Plan, taking into
account the overall investment policy of the Plan and the composition of the Plan’s investment portfolio.
Any Plan proposing to invest in such Notes (including any governmental, church or non-U.S. plan)
should consult with its counsel to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a
non-exempt prohibited transaction and will satisfy the other requirements of ERISA and the Code (or, in
the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any Similar Law).

The sale of any Notes to a Plan is in no respect a representation by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the transfer agent, the registrar, the Initial Purchasers or any other party to the
transactions that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments
by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for Plans generally or
any particular Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement dated June 12, 2014
(the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’), by and among the Issuers, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers, the
Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and
not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, together with all other Initial Purchasers, e550.0 million
(equivalent) principal amount of Notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
their counsel and our counsel. The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that during
the period from the date hereof through and including the date that is 90 days after the date the Notes are
issued, to not, without having received prior written consent provided for in the Purchase Agreement,
offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer that
are substantially similar to the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time
to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act. and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ in
reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in
reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described
under ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’ Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made
acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under ‘‘Offering and Transfer
_Restrictions.’’ The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (1) to non-U.S._
persons outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S and (2) in the
United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A. The terms used above have the
meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering of the Notes, an offer or sale of such
Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering of the Notes may violate
the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities
Act.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer has applied to
list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit the Notes for trading
on the Euro MTF.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any
market making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers
without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the
U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for
the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

In connection with the Offering of the Notes, Goldman Sachs International (the ‘‘Stabilizing Manager’’),
or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the
price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and
purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager, or
persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering of the Notes, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In
addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in
market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids.
These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels
that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and

187


-----

may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or
trading markets for, the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers expect to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States through
their selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers
registered with the SEC.

Each of the Initial Purchasers has also agreed that (a) it has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to
engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection
with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to
the Issuer or the Guarantor; and (b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the
FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the
United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by us or the Initial Purchasers
that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this
offering memorandum or any other material relating to us, the Group or the Notes in any jurisdiction
where action for the purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except
in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering
memorandum does not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this
offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions
relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resales of the
Notes. Please see the section entitled ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and ‘‘Offering and Transfer Restrictions.’’

The Issuer has agreed, and the Guarantors will agree, to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial
Purchaser against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute
to payments that any Initial Purchaser may be required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer will pay the
Initial Purchasers a commission and pay certain fees and expenses relating to the offering of the Notes.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date
as specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the sixth business day
(London business days) following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being herein referred
to as ‘‘T+6’’). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trades expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next
succeeding business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+6
(London business days), to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisors.

From time to time, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have provided, may currently
provide and may in the future provide, investment banking, commercial banking, financial advisory and
other services to us, our affiliates and our shareholders. In addition, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and/or its
affiliates as well as certain fund vehicles managed by BNP Paribas and/or its affiliates are lenders under
the Existing Credit Facilities. BNP Paribas and its affiliates are also providing certain other banking
services to us, our affiliates and our shareholders. The Existing Credit Facilities will be repaid and
cancelled as part of the Transactions. The Initial Purchasers or certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers
have received, and expect to receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. In
addition, the Initial Purchasers or certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers will act as lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility and the PIK Loan.

**OFFERING AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of any of_
_the Notes offered hereby._

Neither the Notes nor the Notes Guarantees have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any
state securities laws and may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred within the United States or to,
or for the account or benefit of, ‘‘U.S. persons’’ (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act)
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of
the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes only:

them in Regulation S.

- You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state or
other securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your property or the

other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a
certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by
the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the
Resale Restriction Termination Date.

- You represent and agree that either (a) you are not and for so long as you holds a Note (or any interest
therein) will not be (i) an ‘‘employee benefit plan’’ as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to
Title I of ERISA, (ii) a ‘‘plan’’ as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (iii) an entity whose
underlying assets include the assets of any such employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or other plan
subject to Section 4975 of the Code, or (iv) a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan which is subject
to any state, local, other federal law of the United States or non-U.S. law that is substantially similar to
the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or (b) your acquisition, holding
and disposition of the Notes will not result in a prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, or, in the case of such a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan, any such

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE**
**COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees_
_and the security interests and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in effect in (i) the_
_Netherlands, the jurisdiction where the Issuer is organized and (ii) the jurisdiction where the Guarantors_
_are organized. It is a summary only, and proceedings (bankruptcy, insolvency or similar events) could be_
_initiated in such jurisdiction and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future guarantor of the Notes. The_
_application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction_
_and law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment_
_in full under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral. Prospective_
_investors should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_The Netherlands_**

Under Dutch law, the obligations of the Issuer, which is incorporated under Dutch law, may be affected
by (a) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force
majeure (niet-toerekenbare _tekortkoming)_ and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene
_omstandigheden); and (c) the other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of_
the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the Notes. Other general defenses include claims that a
security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van
_omstandigheden), fraud_ _(bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors_
include dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening).

The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes may be successfully
contested by a Dutch company (or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in suspension of payments or its
receiver (curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be successful if both (i) the
obligations of the company do not fall within the scope of the objects clause as set out in the company’s
articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company’s counterparty knew or ought to have
known (without inquiry) of this fact. In determining whether a transaction is in furtherance of the objects
and purposes of a Dutch company, a court will consider (i) the text of the objects clause in the
company’s articles of association and (ii) all relevant circumstances including whether the granting of
such security interest is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its
benefit and whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting of such security interest.
The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in a Dutch company’s
objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires.

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be
suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of (i) one or more holders of
shares (or depository receipts issued for shares) in the Dutch company who, solely or jointly, represent:
(a) if the issued capital does not exceed e22.5 million, at least one-tenth of the issued capital or a nominal
value of e225,000 or such less amount as may be provided by the articles of association of the Dutch
company, or (b) if the issued capital exceeds e22.5 million, at least one percent of the issued capital or, if
the shares (or depositary receipts) are admitted to trading on a regulated market or multilateral trading
facility (or comparable system in a non-EEA member state), at least e20 million as at the end of the last
trading date prior to the filing of the application, or such lesser amount as is provided in the articles of
association, (ii) the Dutch company; (iii) the supervisory board, or (if the Dutch company has established
a one-tier board) the non-executive directors, of the Dutch company; (iv) any person authorized to do so
by the articles of association of the Dutch company or under an agreement with the Dutch company; or
(v) the liquidator in bankruptcy in the event of the Dutch company’s bankruptcy. A trade union and other
entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company may also submit a
motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. The guarantee or security itself may further be
upheld by the Enterprise Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

Under Dutch law, any creditor of the Issuer or its receiver (curator) may nullify the issuance of the Notes,
or any other transaction or legal act entered into by the Issuer in connection with the Notes, under certain
circumstances, if (i) the issuance of the Notes, any other transaction or legal act entered into by the
Issuer in connection with the Notes was conducted without prior existing legal obligation to do so
(onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its/their bankruptcy, any creditor was

193


-----

prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim
arose prior to or after such transactions) and (iii) at the time of the issuance of the Notes, or any other
transaction or legal act entered into by the Issuer in connection with the Notes was conducted, the Issuer
and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or
should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
(actio pauliana). A receiver (curator) may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint
insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent
conveyance in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for
certain transactions performed within a ‘‘suspect period’’ of one year prior to an adjudication of
bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in
cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of
existing obligations of the bankrupt which are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its
counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and
its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking
fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent
transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was
conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the
transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been
filed, or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the
counterparty with a view to giving preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors.
Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged
and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries experience
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings.
Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer
and the Guarantors.

**_France_**

_Limitation on Guarantees_

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

- certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute
prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial
Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code;
and

- French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of
another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the
transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee or security interests, taken as a whole. A court
could declare any guarantee or security document unenforceable and, if payment had already been
made under the relevant guarantee or security document, require that the recipient return the payment
to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French guarantor did not fulfill that criteria. The
existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are
commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no
clear guidance.

With respect to certain inter-group transactions (including up-stream guarantees), French case law has
recognized that such transactions can be in the corporate interest of the relevant company, in particular,
where the following criteria are fulfilled:

- the existence of a genuine group of companies (taken as a whole, not just its shareholders) operating
under a common strategy aimed at a common objective;

- the existence of common economic, social or financial interests of the group within the framework of a
policy implemented by the group of companies;

194


-----

- the transaction shall not be without due consideration and compensation and shall not change the
existing balance between the respective obligations of the relevant companies;

- the obligations of the French Guarantor under the guarantee or security documents shall not exceed
its financial capability.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees and the security interests by the French Guarantors and the
amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to amounts that represent either (i) the amount of debt
that each such French Guarantor and the controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor can be
deemed to have refinanced with the proceeds of the Notes through the intercompany loans or (ii) the
amounts of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such French Guarantor, and the
controlled subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, via the Group’s cash-pooling arrangements or
otherwise, and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor
under its Guarantee or a security interest is to be enforced. Any payment made by such French
Guarantor under its Guarantee or a security document will reduce the maximum amount of its
Guarantee. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantee or a security
document could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee or a security document.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee or providing a security
interest, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain
in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic
benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_
_Collateral._

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and the grantor of the security. The
liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if
we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be
noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action
to perfect any of these liens. In France, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a
sock company (soci´et´e par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities
account (nantissement de compte de titres) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities
account pledges will be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (d´eclaration de
_nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each_
statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte
_d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France,_
no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered, with the result that
no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and ‘‘soulte’’_

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be
enforced following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount
that is due and remaining unpaid.

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in
the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the
option of the secured creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged
assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of
the judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual
foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the
secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to
enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured
liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is
determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed
expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire). In a proceeding regarding a
judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or a contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire), an expert is
appointed to value the Collateral (in this case, the securities) and if the value of the Collateral exceeds the
amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a soulte equal to the

195


-----

difference between the value of the securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless
of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of
the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to
the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, an
enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a
going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect
the value of our business as a going concern.

_Parallel Debt—Trust_

Under French law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as rights of pledge require that the
pledgee and the creditor are the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third
parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary under Article 2011 of the French
Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the
Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial bondholders to benefit from a secured claim, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligations in favor of the Security
Agent (the ‘‘Parallel Debt’’) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal
obligors) towards the bondholders under or in connection with the Indenture (the ‘‘Principal
**Obligations’’). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as**
the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the
corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the
holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by
French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the
Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The bondholders will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they
are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

None of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by French
courts and to the extent that the Notes or security interests created under the Parallel Debt and/or trust
constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, bondholders will not receive any proceeds from
an enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the bondholders will
bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n�10-25533 Belv´ed`ere) relating to a bond documentation
governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights
(especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel
Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel
Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy _(ordre public_
_international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double_
payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is
generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt
structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all
cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to
the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests
securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a
case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the
enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no
certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construction are
successfully challenged by other parties, bondholders will not be entitled to receive on this basis any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The bondholders will bear the
risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of
the Parallel Debt.

196


-----

The concept of ‘‘trust’’ has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com.
September 13, 2011 n�10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by
the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings
opened in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not
ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so
that the concept of ‘‘trust’’ has not been generally recognized under French law.

_Fraudulent conveyance_

French law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside
insolvency proceedings, the ‘‘action paulienne’’ provisions. The _action paulienne offers creditors_
protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including,
without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which such person guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of such person’s or a third
party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other
legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant
person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or
recovery plan (commissaire `a l’ex´ecution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by
any of the creditors of the relevant person outside insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was
prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings,
and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without
an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings,
any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the
act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known
that one or more of such person’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (`a titre gratuit), in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent
conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the
Collateral, or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any
defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the
Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or
declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a
result of such successful challenges, bondholders may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the value of any consideration that bondholders
received with respect to the Notes, the security interests in the Collateral or the Notes Guarantees could
also be subject to recovery from the bondholders and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In
addition, under such circumstances, bondholders might be held liable for any damages incurred by
prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

_Assumptions as to the validity of the Intercreditor Agreement_

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the
Intercreditor Agreement, except for article L.626-30-2 of the French Commercial Code which states that,
in the context of safeguard proceedings, the safeguard plan which is put to the committees of creditors
takes into consideration (prend en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between
creditors which were entered into prior to the opening of the safeguard proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as at the date of this offering memorandum, has received
no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Switzerland_**

_Limitations on Guarantees and Security Interests granted by any Swiss subsidiaries_

One or several of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (the ‘‘Swiss
**Guarantors’’).**

The granting of guarantees or security by the Swiss Guarantors is subject to certain restrictions in the
distribution of corporate assets under Swiss corporate law. Therefore, in order to enable the Swiss

197


-----

Guarantors to grant guarantees or security securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating
such restrictions and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for
guarantees granted by a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschr¨ankter Haftung) incorporated in Switzerland to contain so-called ‘‘limitation language.’’_
Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of the Guarantee or security granted by each of
the Swiss Guarantors will be limited reflecting the requirement that payments under the Guarantee or
enforcement of the security may not cause the Swiss Guarantor to incur a liability which would exceed its
freely distributable equity at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee or the security. The freely
distributable equity capital is equal to the maximum amount which the relevant Swiss Guarantor can
distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law at that point in time. Presently, the
freely distributable equity capital is equal to the balance sheet profits, and any reserves available for
distribution at the time or times at which payment under the Guarantee is requested or the security shall
be enforced. These limitations apply in relation to guarantees securing the performance of any
obligations of any (direct or indirect) shareholder and/or any sister company of the Swiss Guarantors.

In addition, the enforcement of a Swiss Guarantor’s Guarantee or security granted may give rise to Swiss
withholding taxes (of up to 35% at present rates, subject to applicable double taxation treaties) to the
extent that the payment or enforcement of such Guarantee or security are regarded as a deemed
dividend distribution. Under Swiss law, any obligation of a Swiss Guarantor to gross-up, indemnify or
otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss withholding tax may not be
valid and, thus, may prejudice the enforceability of anything to the contrary contained above under
‘‘Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts’’ or in the Indenture. In addition, any obligation to
gross-up, indemnify or otherwise hold harmless the holders of the Notes for the deduction of Swiss
withholding tax in connection with a Guarantee or security granted by a Swiss Guarantor would in any
case be limited by the amount of the freely distributable equity of the Swiss Guarantor.

_Fraudulent Transfer Provisions of General Applicability Including During Bankruptcy_

Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration may, under certain conditions, avoid
transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of or the payment under any guarantee or, if a payment has
already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipients return the amount received
to the debtor’s estate. In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee and
the payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss
insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors:

- The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any
consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening
of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the
debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided.

- Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at
that time: (i) granting of security for existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously
obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any other way
than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a
debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is dismissed if the beneficiary of the transaction can
prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that
the debtor had been over-indebted at that time.

- Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung) performed by the debtor with the intention to discriminate
some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to others are voidable if such intention was, or
exercising the requisite due diligence, must have been known to the debtor’s counterparty.

The same provisions apply in the event of a composition with creditors with assignment of assets
(Nachlassvertrag mit Verm¨ogensabtretung), another insolvency proceeding under Swiss law that leads
to a liquidation of the assets of the debtor. In a composition with creditors, the relevant hardening period
of one and five years respectively is, depending on the nature of the relevant avoidable transaction, the
one-year or five-years period preceding the grant of the moratorium (Nachlassstundung).

If any guarantee is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the
claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and would have a claim solely under

198


-----

the Notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been
avoided would have to be repaid.

**_Germany_**

The German Guarantors are incorporated in the form of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschr¨ankter Haftung, ‘‘GmbH’’). Consequently, the grant of collateral by them is subject to certain_
provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaft mit
_beschr¨ankter Haftung, ‘‘GmbHG’’)._

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (‘‘Sections 30 and 31’’) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e.,
assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated
share capital (Stammkapital). The granting of guarantees, share pledges and other security by a GmbH
in order to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered
disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant
guarantees and to create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister
company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures,
credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in
relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or a limited liability partnership
(Kommanditgesellschaft) with a GmbH as its sole general partner (Komplement¨ar) (‘‘GmbH & Co. KG’’)
incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the
security interests agree, subject to certain exemptions, to require payments under the guarantee or, as
the case may be, enforce the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that
such payment or, as the case may be, enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of
a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case
may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount
to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and other relevant documents relating to the Notes Guarantees
and the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors or other German security providers will contain
such limitation language and the relevant Notes Guarantees and Collateral will be limited in the manner
described.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. Future court rulings may
further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH
or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make payments on the
Notes Guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the Collateral or of the beneficiaries of the Notes
Guarantees to enforce the Notes Guarantees.

**Certain Insolvency Law Considerations**

**_European Union_**

The Issuer and several of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Member States of the
European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘E.U. Insolvency
**Regulation’’), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member**
State in which a company’s ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the E.U.
Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The
determination of where a company has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. To date, no final
decisions have been made in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in
relation to questions of interpretation of the effects of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation throughout the
European Union.

Although there is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation that a company has
its ‘‘center of main interests’’ in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of
proof to the contrary, Preamble 13 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘center of main
interests’’ of a ‘‘debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.’’ The courts have taken into
consideration a number of factors in determining the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company, including

199


-----

in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its
business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are
established. A company’s ‘‘center of main interests’’ may change from time to time but is determined for
the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at
the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

The E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency
proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. If the ‘‘center of main
interests’’ of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the E.U.
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
open insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the
territory of such other Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean a place of operations where
the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. The effects of
those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the
company situated in such other Member State.

Where main proceedings have been opened in the Member State in which the company has its center of
main interests, any proceedings opened subsequently in another Member State in which the company
has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to ‘‘winding up proceedings’’ listed in
Annex B of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings
can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment where either
(a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of
main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
opened at the request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in
the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening
main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no
secondary proceedings have been opened there. The liquidator appointed by a court in a Member State
which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s center of main interests is
there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member
State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State) subject to certain
limitations so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any
preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that
other Member State where the company has assets.

**_France_**

_Insolvency_

We conduct a part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the center of our main
interests is deemed to be in France, we would be subject to French insolvency proceedings affecting
creditors. French laws and proceedings affecting creditors include debt rescheduling pursuant to
Article 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil), ad hoc agency proceedings (mandat ad hoc),
conciliation proceedings (proc´edure de conciliation), safeguard proceedings (proc´edure de
_sauvegarde), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde financi`ere acc´el´er´ee) and_
judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or _liquidation judiciaire). Similarly,_
French Guarantors would be subject to French insolvency proceedings. In general, French insolvency
legislation favors the continuation of a business and the protection of employment over the payment of
creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and/or the Notes Guarantees
granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding Security Interests.

The following is a general discussion of insolvency proceedings governed by French law for
informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may be
relevant to holders of the Notes.

Under the European Council Regulation (EC) No.1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency
proceedings, if a debtor is located in the European Union (other than Denmark), French courts shall
have jurisdiction over the main insolvency proceedings if the center of the debtor’s main interests is
situated in France. In the case of a company or legal person, the place of the registered office shall be
presumed to be the center of its main interests in the absence of proof to the contrary. In determining

200


-----

whether the center of main interests of a company is in France, French courts will take into account a
broad range of factual elements.

_Grace periods_

In addition to pre-insolvency and insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors,
be subject to Articles 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to Articles 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code, French courts may, in any civil proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor’s
financial position and the creditor’s financial needs, defer or otherwise reschedule the payment dates of
payment obligations over a maximum period of two years and decide that any amounts, the payment
date of which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual
rate (but not lower than the legal rate which is set annually) or that payments made shall first be allocated
to repayment of the principal. If a court order under Articles 1244-1 et seq. of the French Civil Code is
made, it will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual interest or penalty for
late payment will not accrue or be due during the period ordered by the court. A creditor cannot contract
out of such grace periods. When the debtor benefits from conciliation proceedings, these statutory
provisions shall be read in combination with Article L.611-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce) (see ‘‘—Conciliation proceedings’’)._

_Insolvency test_

Under French law, a company is considered to be insolvent (en ´etat cessation des paiements) when it is
unable to pay its debts when they fall due with its available assets taking into account available credit
lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria.

_Mandat Ad Hoc Proceedings_

A French company facing difficulties may request the opening of a mandat ad hoc proceedings, the aim
of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and stakeholders.

French law does not provide for any specific rule in respect of mandat ad hoc proceedings, except that
these proceedings (i) are confidential by law and (ii) may only be initiated by the debtor company itself,
in its sole discretion. Mandat ad hoc proceedings are not limited in time and are informal proceedings
carried out under the supervision of the President of the relevant court (usually the Commercial Court
(Tribunal de commerce)), which do not involve any stay of the proceedings. A company that is facing any
type of difficulties (but which has not been insolvent (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’) for over 45 days) may
request from the competent court the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc, whose name it can suggest.
The _mandataire ad hoc’s duties are determined by the court. Such_ _mandataire ad hoc is usually_
appointed in order to facilitate negotiations with creditors but they cannot coerce the creditors into
accepting any proposal. The agreement reached by the parties (if any) with the help of such mandataire
_ad hoc can be reported by the latter to the President of the court but is not approved by the court. The_
restructuring agreement between the company and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the
arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their
claims but, in practice, they usually accept not to do so.

In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set forth
above.

_Conciliation Proceedings_

A French company facing difficulties may request the opening of conciliation proceedings (proc´edure
_de conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with the debtor’s main creditors and_
stakeholders.

Points that conciliation proceedings have in common with _mandat ad hoc proceedings are_
(i) confidentiality by law and (ii) they may only be initiated by the debtor company itself, in its sole
discretion. Main differences include (i) the conditions to open conciliation proceedings, (ii) the limitation
in time of conciliation proceedings, (iii) the right to petition the President of the Commercial Court for a
grace period and (iv) the ability to acknowledge or approve the restructuring agreement.

201


-----

A company may, in its sole discretion, apply for the opening of conciliation proceedings with respect to
itself, provided it (i) is not insolvent (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’), or has been insolvent for fewer than
45 days and (ii) experiences current or predictable legal, economic or financial difficulties. The debtor
petitions the President of the Commercial Court for the appointment of a conciliator (whose name it can
suggest) in charge of assisting the debtor in negotiating with all or part of its creditors and/or trade
partners an agreement that ends its difficulties. Conciliation proceedings are confidential and may last
up to five months. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for payment of
their claims but they usually in practice accept not to do so. In addition, the debtor retains the right to
petition for a grace period, but will do so before the President of the Commercial Court.

This agreement may be either acknowledged (constat´e) by the President of the court or approved
(homologu´e) by the court. It will become binding upon them and the creditors party thereto may not take
action against the company in respect of claims governed by the agreement.

The acknowledgement (constatation) of the agreement by the President of the court upon all parties’
request, gives the agreement the legal force of a final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial
title that can be enforced by the parties without further recourse to a judge (titre ex´ecutoire), but the
conciliation proceedings remain confidential.

The approval (homologation) by the court, upon debtor’s request, will make the conciliation proceedings
public and have the following specific consequences:

- creditors who provided new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the
business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will have priority
of payment over all pre-proceeding and post-proceeding claims (other than certain post-proceeding
employment claims and procedural costs) (the ‘‘New Money Lien’’), in the event of subsequent
safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; and

- in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the
date of the cessation des paiements (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’), and therefore the commencement date
of the suspect period (see ‘‘—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings’’) cannot be set by
the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the
court.

A third party having granted a guarantee (sˆuret´e personnelle) or a security interest (sˆuret´e r´eelle) can
benefit from the provisions of the approved or acknowledged agreement.

In the event of a breach of the agreement, any party to the agreement can petition the court for its
termination. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to
the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests,
with the exception of amounts already paid to them.

Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a
large majority of creditors without reaching unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

_Safeguard Proceedings_

A company may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (proc´edure de sauvegarde) with
respect to itself, provided it (i) is not insolvent (en ´etat de cessation des paiements) and (ii) experiences
difficulties that it is not able to overcome. Creditors of the company do not attend the hearing before the
court at which the opening of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the opening of safeguard
proceedings, a court-appointed administrator investigates the business of the company during an
observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and helps the company elaborate a draft safeguard
plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will submit to its creditors. One of the main consequences of
the opening of safeguard proceedings is that creditors do not have effective control over the procedure,
which remains in the hands of the company assisted by the court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) who will, being overseen by the court and pursuant to the terms of the opening
judgment, exercise a control a posteriori over the decisions made by the debtor (‘‘mission de
_surveillance’’) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (‘‘mission d_
_‘assistance’’)._

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred prior to the opening of
the proceedings is prohibited, subject to limited exceptions such as set-off payments of interrelated

202


-----

debts. For example, the bankruptcy judge can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a
lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or recover goods or rights
transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) In addition, creditors are required to
declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) the debts that arose prior
to the opening of the proceedings (as well as the post-opening non-privileged debts) and are prohibited
from engaging any individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment default in relation to such
debts (see ‘‘—Status of creditors during safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard
_proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings’’) and the accrual of_
interest on loans with a term of less than one year, or on payments deferred for less than one year, is
stopped. Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to
expenses necessary for the business’s ordinary activities during the observation period or are for the
requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this
period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority of
payment over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the safeguard proceedings (with certain
limited exceptions, such as the ‘‘New Money Lien’’ (see ‘‘—Conciliation Proceedings’’)).

The manner in which the liabilities will be settled, as provided for in the plan (debt remissions and
payment times and/or conversion of debt into equity) must be submitted to the creditors during a
consultation, prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation vary
according to the size of the business.

_‘‘Ordinary’’ consultation:_ for a debtor whose accounts are not certified by a statutory auditor or
prepared by a chartered accountant, and who does not have more than 150 employees or e20 million in
turnover, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed
creditors’ representative, who, individually or collectively, obtains the agreement of each creditor who
stated a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment times proposed.

The French Commercial Code does not state whether the proposals for settlement can vary according to
the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at the consultation
stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, in the absence of a specific legislative
prohibition, varying treatment of creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the specific position
of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also
possible to make alternative proposals at the consultation stage (which generally breaks down into a
short-term option, with debt remissions and rapid payment of the balance, and a long-term option with
100% repayment of the debts over ten years. The courts tend to impose a long-term solution).

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the
plan is approved are not consulted.

In the event of a consultation in writing, if a creditor does not respond within 30 days as from receipt of
the letter from the creditors’ representative, such creditor is deemed to have accepted the proposal. The
creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the
administrator and the monitors.

Within the framework of an ordinary consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were
submitted to them, the court that approves the turnaround plan can only obligate them to accept deferral
of the payment of their receivables over a maximum period of ten years. All forgiveness of debt and/or
conversion of debt into equity is contingent on individual acceptance.

_Committee-based consultation:_ For a debtor that exceeds the aforementioned thresholds, or for a
debtor who does not but with the authorization of the supervisory judge, the court-appointed
administrator sets up two creditors’ committees, on the basis of the debts that arose prior to the initial
judgment: one for credit institutions (or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or
advances in favor of the debtor) and their successive assignees having a claim against the debtor, and
the other for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all
the debtor’s suppliers. These committees will be consulted on the draft safeguard plan. In addition, any
member of a committee may submit suggestions to the debtor and the court appointed administrator for
drawing up a safeguard plan to be drafted by the debtor’s management during the observation period.
Bondholders and note holders are not part of the creditors’ committee but are convened within a specific
meeting of bondholders, as specified below.

203


-----

The committees must announce whether they approve or reject the safeguard plan within a minimum of
15 days of its submission. The plan must be approved by a majority vote of each committee, provided
that the majority is two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. The amounts
of the claims secured by a trust (fiducie) constituted as a guarantee granted by the debtor are not taken
into account. In addition, creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of their
repayment schedule or provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is
adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted do not take part in the vote.

If there are any holders of bonds including notes, they are required to vote on the plan during a general
meeting of bondholders regrouping all holders of bonds and notes of the debtor (even if they relate to
different issues, in particular with respect to subordination or security, and regardless of the law
applicable to each issue) held for that purpose and approve the plan at the same two-thirds majority
vote. There is no separate meeting per bond or note issue. Approval of the plan at the two-thirds majority
shall, if the plan is approved by the court, bind all members of the committees and the holders of the
Notes (including those who abstained or voted against the adoption of the plan). The plan submitted to
the committees and the holders of the Notes, if any, must take into account subordination agreements
entered into by the creditors before the opening of the proceedings, may treat creditors differently if it is
justified by their differences in situation and may notably include rescheduling or canceling of debts,
and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If, within the first six months of the observation period, the creditors’ committees and the meeting of the
holders of the Notes approve the plan, and subject to verification by the court that the interests of all
creditors are sufficiently safeguarded and to a rescheduling of the claim of creditors that are not
members of the committees or holders of the Notes (as discussed hereinafter), the court will approve the
plan. With respect to creditors who are not members of the committees or in the event no committees are
established, proposals are made to each creditor collectively or individually. Creditors for whom the plan
does not provide any modification of their repayment schedules or provides for a complete
reimbursement in cash of their claims as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are
admitted do not need to be consulted on the plan.

For those creditors (which are outside the creditors’ committee or the meeting of the holders of the
Notes) who have not reached a negotiated agreement, the court can impose a uniform rescheduling of
the repayment of their debts over a maximum period of ten years, except for debts with maturity dates of
more than ten years, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same. The court cannot obligate
such creditors to waive any part of their claims or accept debt-for-equity swaps. The first payment must
be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount
of each annual installment must be of at least 5% of the total amount of the debt claims). As an exception,
if the principal amount of a debt has not become due and payable in full on the first payment date set out
in the plan approved by the Court, repayment of that debt will begin on the annual payment date set out
in the plan which immediately follows the maturity date stipulated by the parties in the relevant document
prior to the opening of the proceedings. On this date the principal will be paid in an amount equal to the
amount the creditor would have received if it had been subject to the uniform payment terms imposed by
the Court and set out in the plan. Future amounts paid to that creditor will be made in accordance with
the uniform payment terms imposed to other creditors under the plan unless no uniform payment terms
have been imposed by the court in which case, the amount of the following annuities to be paid will
correspond to equal annual fractions of the remaining principal amount remaining.

In the event that the debtor company’s proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the
general meeting of holders of the Notes within the first six months of the observation period, either
because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan
in the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case the rules applicable to all
creditors are the same as the ones applicable to creditors that are not part of the committees and that are
not holders of the Notes and, in particular, the court can only impose a uniform rescheduling of the
repayment of the debts over a maximum period of ten years (as described above).

Creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of their repayment schedules or provides
for a complete reimbursement in cash of their claims as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their
claims are admitted do not need to be consulted on the plan.

_Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions:_ Public creditors (financial administrations, social
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under
conditions that are similar to those that would be granted by a private economic operator placed in the

204


-----

same position, under normal market conditions. Public creditors may also decide to enter into
subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors
are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a commission where the heads of
finance departments and the organizations and institutions concerned are represented. The tax
administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted
from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

In the event that safeguard (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are opened against the Issuer, the
holders of the Notes will be treated as holders of the Notes of the Issuer and will take part in the general
meeting of holders of the Notes and the committees of the holders of the Notes, if any. Therefore, the
holders of the Notes would not be a member of the credit institutions’ committee but would vote on any
draft plan proposed by the Issuer as members of the general meeting of holders of the Notes.

Holders of the Notes could, as members of the general meeting of holders of the Notes, veto such plan if
they reach a blocking minority (i.e., their claims represent more than one-third of the claims of those
creditors casting a vote in the meeting).

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the bank debt claim will be invited onto the credit institutions’
committee. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of
the credit institutions’ committee.

_Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings_

Envisaged as a means of facilitating ‘‘pre-pack’’ bankruptcies in France, born from the ‘‘pre-pack’’
restructuring practice, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (‘‘AFS’’) are available to a debtor
having prepared in conciliation proceedings a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his or
her business as a going concern supported by enough of its financial creditors exclusively (i.e.,
members of the credit institutions’ committee and holders of the Notes) to render likely its adoption (at
the two-thirds majority applicable in safeguard proceedings) by the credit institutions’ committee and
the general meeting of the holders of the Notes, if any, within a maximum of two months of the opening of
the proceedings.

Only financial creditors (e.g., creditors members of the credit institutions committee and holders of the
Notes) are implicated in such a restructuring plan and consulted on the draft safeguard plan, and
therefore an AFS filing does not affect or entail the suspension of payments to creditors other than
financial creditors (e.g., suppliers of goods and services which continue to be paid according to their
applicable contract terms and are not subject to the moratorium on enforcement action during the
observation period). As to financial creditors, the debtor will be prohibited from paying any amounts in
connection with the finance documents that fall due during the observation period. Should interest fall
due during the observation period, they may be paid only after the judgment of the Commercial Court
sanctioning the safeguard plan.

As with traditional safeguard proceedings, the plan adopted in the context of an AFS may notably
provide for rescheduling, debt cancelation and/or conversion of debt into equity capital in the debtor
company (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

In order to file for an AFS, the debtor company must (i) be engaged in conciliation proceedings; (ii) justify
the preparation of a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of his or her business as a going
concern supported by enough of its financial creditors to render likely its adoption by the credit
institutions’ committee and the meeting of the holders of the Notes in order to be adopted by the majority
of two-thirds of the amount of claims held by the committee of credit institutions’ members and by the
general meeting of bondholders’ members having expressed their vote within a maximum of two months
of the AFS filing; in practice, an agreement on the draft safeguard plan is previously signed by lenders in
order to prove their support; (iii) not be insolvent; (iv) face financial difficulties which it finds itself unable
to overcome and (v) have (a) either more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than e20 million or
(b) a total balance sheet exceeding (aa) e25 million or (bb) e10 million if they control another company
(X) which has more than 150 employees, (Y) whose turnover for the previous financial year is greater
than e20 million or (Z) whose total balance sheet exceeds e25 million. Therefore, based on currently
applicable regulations, the Issuer is eligible for AFS proceedings.

Creditors, other than financial creditors, such as public creditors, the tax or social security administration
and suppliers are not directly impacted by the AFS. Their debts will continue to be due and payable
according to their contractual or legal terms.

205


-----

Since the AFS proceedings are by nature accelerated proceedings, very tight deadlines are imposed.
The Commercial Court must approve any restructuring plan within one month of the date on which the
procedure has begun, although this deadline may be extended by up to a maximum of one additional
month. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within such deadlines, the
court is obligated to terminate the proceedings.

_Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire) may
be initiated against or by a company only if it is insolvent and, with respect to liquidation proceedings
only, if the company’s recovery is manifestly impossible. Note that the French Supreme Court held
anti-constitutional (i) the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings by the Court at its own initiative
(December 7, 2012 n�2012-286 QPC), (ii) the opening of judicial liquidation proceedings by the Court at
its own initiative (March 7, 2014, n� 2013-368 QPC), and (iii) the termination of the safeguard plan and
subsequent opening of judicial liquidation proceedings by the Court at its own initiative (March 7, 2014,
n� 2013-372 QPC). The company is required to petition for insolvency proceedings (or for conciliation
proceedings, as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. If it does not, de jure managers
(including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to incurring civil liability.

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order
commencing proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be up to 18 months before
the date of the court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date
than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of
conciliation proceedings see ‘‘—Conciliation Proceedings’’ above). The date of insolvency is important
because it marks the beginning of the suspect period (or otherwise referred to as ‘‘hardening period’’).
Certain transactions undertaken during the suspect period may be void or voidable.

Under the judicial reorganization the administrator appointed by the Court will assist the debtor to make
all or some of the management decisions (mission d’assistance) and may also be empowered by the
Court to take over the management and control the company (mission d’administration). The opening of
liquidation proceedings entails the relief of the debtor of the management.

The court order commencing the proceedings may order either the liquidation or the reorganization of
the company. In the event of reorganization, an administrator is usually appointed by the court
(administrateur judiciaire) to investigate the business of the company during an observation period,
which may last up to 18 months, and makes proposals either for the reorganization of the company (by
helping the debtor to elaborate a reorganization plan, which is similar to a safeguard plan), or the sale of
the business in whole or in part or the liquidation of the company. However, it cannot be ruled out that
further to the aforementioned decision from the French Supreme Court, the constitutionality of the
conversion of a safeguard or judicial reorganization procedure into judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings, when it is decided upon the court’s own initiative, be challenged. Committees of creditors
and meeting of the holders of the Notes may be created under the same conditions as in safeguard
proceedings (see above). At any time during this observation period, the court can order the liquidation
of the company. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the
court.

_Void and Voidable Transaction_

‘‘Void transactions’’ include transactions or payments entered into during the suspect period that may
constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors.
These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations
of the company significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of
payment, payments made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business,
any escrow ordered by a judicial decision if such decision is not final when reorganization or liquidation
proceedings are commenced, security granted for debts previously incurred, any provisional measures
(unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency) operations relating to stock
options, fiduciary transfers (unless the transfer is made as a security for an indebtedness entered into
simultaneously) and modifications to existing fiduciary transfers securing previous debts.

‘‘Voidable transactions’’ include payments for due debts made from the date of insolvency, transactions
for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis `a tiers d´etenteur), seizures
(saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the suspect period if the party dealing with the debtor

206


-----

company knew that it was insolvent (see ‘‘—Insolvency test’’). Transactions relating to the transfer of
assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the
beginning of the suspect period.

_Creditors’ Liability_

Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code as interpreted by case law, where safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors may be held
liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor only if the granting of such
facilities was wrongful and, in the case of (i) fraud; (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or
(iii) if the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In
addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found
liable on any of these grounds can be canceled or reduced by the court.

_Status of creditors during safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings,_
_judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings_

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the
proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire)
within two months of the publication of the court order in the BODACC (Bulletin Officiel des Annonces
_Civiles et Commerciales). This period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside France._
Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period are barred, except if they can
obtain that the bar be lifted which is subject to specific conditions, from receiving distributions made in
accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limits and are preferential
creditors under French law.

From the date of the court order commencing the insolvency proceedings (safeguard proceedings,
accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (subject to the below), judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings), the company is prohibited from paying (i) debts outstanding prior to that date, subject to
specified exceptions, which essentially concern the set-off of interrelated debts and payments made to
recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business, provided that
such payments are authorized by the bankruptcy judge and (ii) debts arising after the opening of the
proceedings if such debts are not useful to the proceedings (post-opening, non-privileged debts).
During this period, creditors may not pursue any legal action against the company with respect to any
claim arising prior to the court order commencing the proceedings or, as the case may be, for the
aforementioned post-opening, non-privileged debts if the objective of such legal action is:

- to obtain an order for or a payment of a sum of money by the company to the creditor (however, the
creditor may require that a court fix the amount due); or

- to terminate a contract for non-payment of pre-petition amounts owed by the company or to enforce
the creditor’s rights against any assets of the company, except where such asset, whether tangible or
intangible, movable or immovable, is located in another EU Member State, in which case the rights
_in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with_
the terms of Article 5 of European Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings.

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, however:

- debts owed to creditors other than banks, financial institutions or holders of the Notes should be paid
in the ordinary course; and

- the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having participated in the conciliation proceedings,
which is certified by its statutory auditors (or in its absence, its accountant). Claims set in this list are
deemed declared. Although such creditors are granted the faculty to file proofs of claim pursuant to
the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the
amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four months’
regular time limit as from the publication of the opening judgment in the BODACC) or modify the
information relating to their claims as set forth in the list, should they consider it inaccurate. Those
financial creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceeding (but who would be party to the
financial institutions’ committee or the meeting of the holders of the Notes) would have to file their
proofs of claim within the aforementioned legal time limits.

Contractual provisions whereby a company’s payment obligations are mandatorily accelerated upon
the occurrence of (i) the opening of safeguard proceedings, accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings or judicial reorganization proceedings, or (ii) insolvency (cessation des paiements), are
deemed void and therefore not enforceable under French law. The opening of liquidation proceedings,
however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a company’s obligations unless the continued
operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a ‘‘plan for the sale of the business’’ (plan de
_cession) is ordered by the Court (for a period of three months, renewable once), in which case the_
acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the ‘‘plan for the
sale of the business’’ or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends.

Counterparties to a contract with the company are not allowed to terminate such contract on the sole
basis of the opening of insolvency proceedings. The court-appointed administrator may elect to
terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which he or she believes the debtor will not be able to
continue to perform. On the contrary, he or she may require the continuation of such contracts provided
that the company fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations, or may decide not to continue
them. The Court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems necessary to the
continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If the court adopts a ‘‘plan for the sale of the business’’ (plan de cession) in judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings with a temporary continuation of the business, the proceeds from the sale will be
allocated for the payment of creditors according to their ranking.

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the company, the court will appoint a liquidator
which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). No maximum time period
is provided by law to limit the duration of the judicial liquidation process conducted by the liquidator,
vested with the power to represent the company and perform such liquidation operations (mainly
liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are
sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment). Concerning the liquidation of the
assets, there are two possible outcomes of such liquidation scenario:

- an asset sale plan, which is governed by the same principles as above. In practice, where an asset
sale plan is considered, the court will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the company
and organize such sale of the business, or

- a sale of the assets one by one, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

  - launch auction sales,

  - sell on an amicable basis each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received,
the formal authorization of the bankruptcy judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement
with the bidder, or

   - request, under the surveillance of the bankruptcy judge, from all potential interested purchasers
to bid on each asset, as the case may be by way of a private competitive process whereby the
bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without disclosing the proposed price before such
hearing (proc´edure des plis cachet´es).

French insolvency law provides for a priority order for payment of certain insolvent company’s
preferential creditors, essentially as follows: employees, officials appointed by the insolvency court as
required by the regulations relating to insolvency proceedings, creditors who, as part of an approved
conciliation agreement, have provided new money or goods or services, certain secured creditors in the
event of judicial liquidation proceedings, post-petition creditors, the French State, other prepetition
secured creditors and pre-petition unsecured creditors.

When no due liabilities remain or when the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors
(extinction du passif), when continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to
insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif), the Court terminates the proceedings.

_Main modifications of French bankruptcy regime_

French insolvency law will change as a result of Ordinance No. 2014-326 of March 12, 2014 relating to
the reform of the prevention of corporate difficulties and of insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘Ordinance
**No. 2014-326’’), which will come into force on July 1, 2014, it being specified that Ordinance**
No. 2014-326 will not apply to ongoing proceedings at this date. This reform will affect the current regime

208


-----

explained above in relation to _mandat ad hoc proceedings,_ _conciliation proceedings, safeguard_
proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings.

Ordinance No. 2014-326 provides in particular for the following modifications:

**_Out of court proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings)_**

- extension of the benefit of the New Money Lien (see ‘‘—Conciliation Proceedings’’) to creditors who
agree to provide cash (other than by way of share capital increase), goods or services to a debtor ‘‘in
_the course of conciliation proceedings’’ giving rise to an agreement approved by the Court (‘‘accord_
_homologu´e’’). Under current law, creditors can only benefit from the New Money Lien over new money_
which has been provided for in the conciliation agreement, which shall be approved (homologu´e) by
the court; the new money being made available after the court’s judgment approving the conciliation
agreement;

- in the event the opening of subsequent safeguard proceedings or judicial reorganization, within the
context of the adoption of a safeguard plan or a recovery plan, the Court will not be able to impose a
payment deferral to a date later than the date on which the plan is adopted or debt reductions to
creditors with respect to their claims benefiting from the New Money Lien, it being specified that this
new provision shall not prevent these creditors from granting such delays or debt reductions;

- at the request of the debtor and after the participating creditors have expressed their opinion, the
conciliator may be appointed with a mission to organize the partial or total sale of the company which
would occur, if applicable, in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings;

- in case of acknowledgement (constat) of the agreement by the Court President or in case of approval
(homologation) by the Court, it can, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator as a court
nominee monitoring the implementation of the agreement (mandataire `a l’ex´ecution de l’accord)
during its execution;

- with respect to grace periods under Articles 1244-1 and subsequent of the French Civil Code, the
judge having opening conciliation proceedings (i) may grant delays under such Articles even when
the formal notice asking the debtor to pay was sent before conciliation proceedings (and not only
during conciliation proceedings) and (ii) may, during the execution period of the conciliation
agreement, impose payment deferrals to creditors (other than the tax and social security
administrations) whose claims were not included in the conciliation agreement;

- two types of contractual provisions shall be deemed null and void: (i) any provision that modifies the
conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its
obligations simply by reason of the appointment of a _mandatire ad hoc or of the opening of a_
conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end and (ii) any provision forcing the debtor
to bear, simply by reason of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the opening of conciliation
proceedings, the fees of the counsel whom the creditor has retained in connection with these
procedures for the portion exceeding the proportion to be set out by decree of the minister of justice.

**_In-court proceedings_**

- power granted to the creditors’ representative in safeguard proceedings to summon a shareholder to
pay any outstanding amount due over the shares he subscribed ;

- the opening judgment of safeguard proceedings leads to the immediate maturity of the amount not
paid up of the share capital;

- right granted to any creditor member of a committee to submit a draft safeguard plan, it being
specified that these alternative plans are subject (i) to the preparation of a report for each alternative
plan from the administrator and (ii) to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and by a
two-thirds majority vote of the general meeting of the holders of the Notes (although the holders of the
Notes are not permitted to present their own alternative plan) for their approval;

- at the request of the court-appointed administrator, extension of the deadline to vote on the plan by
creditors and bondholders for a period of time which cannot exceed the observation period,

- each creditor member of a creditors committee and each note holder must, if applicable, inform the
judicial administrator of the existence of any agreement which makes the exercise of its vote subject to

209


-----

any conditions or whose purpose is the full or total payment by a third party of its claim as well as of
any subordination agreement. The judicial administrator shall then submit to the creditor/note holder a
proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders general
meeting. In the event of a disagreement, the creditor/note holder or the judicial administrator may
request that the matter be decided by the president of the applicable court in summary proceedings
(en r´ef´er´e).

- creation of a new type of accelerated safeguard proceedings (proc´edure de sauvegarde acc´el´er´ee),
besides the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, including also non-financial creditors, it
being specified that the competent court must approve any pre-approved restructuring plan by
affected creditors within three months of the date on which the accelerated safeguard proceedings
have been opened; such proceedings will be available to a debtor (i) who is under a conciliation
proceeding, (ii) who publishes accounts certified by an auditor and meet certain thresholds (in terms
of number of employees, revenues and total net assets) which are to be set by a decree which has yet
to be published, or (iii) who publishes consolidated accounts. There is no condition for the debtor to
be solvent at the time of making the request for the opening of such proceedings;

- the competent court will decide the opening of such proceeding upon review of a report prepared by a
conciliator indicating the process of the conciliation proceedings and the chances for the restructuring
plan to be adopted by the creditors. The competent court when ordering the opening of an
accelerated safeguard proceedings will also order the establishment of creditors’ committee if the
debtor is not under an obligation to establish such committees;.

- if no plan is adopted by the committees, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the
_mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into_
judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible
and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly within a short time frame lead to the
company being insolvent.

**_Modifications interesting reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only_**

- If a company has lost more than half of its share capital (fonds propres) and this has not been
reconstituted on terms set out by Articles L. 626-3, the administrator may request the appointment of a
mandataire with power to call a meeting of the shareholders and to vote on the reconstitution of the
share capital in the minimum amount, in place of the shareholders which have refused to reconstitute
the share capital (fonds propres) in circumstances where the draft plan provides for a modification of
the share capital in favor of one or more persons under the plan;

- following the decision from the French Supreme Court dated December 7, 2012 (n� 2012-286 QPC),
repeal of the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings by the Court at its own initiative;

- following the decision from the French Supreme Court dated March 7, 2014 (n� 2013-368 QPC), repeal
of the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings by the Court at its own initiative;

- in reorganization proceedings, in case the shareholders’ equity has not been restored, the
administrator may appoint a trustee (mandataire en justice) to vote in place of the shareholders
refusing to vote to restore the shareholder’s equity if the draft restructuring plan provides for a
modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the recovery
plan;

- the Court will no longer be able to commence judicial reorganization proceedings on its own initiative;

- the Court will no longer be able to commence judicial liquidation proceedings on its own initiative;

- simplification of the judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation judiciaire), it being specified that the
court may terminate the proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is
disproportionate compared to the difficulty to sell the assets. The court may also appoint a mandataire
in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocate the amounts received from these lawsuits
between the remaining creditors.

**_Germany_**

_Insolvency_

In the event of insolvency of a guarantor or provider of collateral organized under the laws of Germany
and/or having its center of main interests in Germany any main insolvency proceedings would most
likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. The
insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions,
including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as
security interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of
creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under
other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

_German Insolvency Proceedings_

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event of or illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) of
the debtor, meaning that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. According to the
relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is not considered
over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values) if, given
the circumstances, it is more likely than not (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich) that the debtor’s business
can survive as a going concern.

If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung—GmbH), a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—
_SE), any other limited liability company or any company not having an individual as personally liable_
shareholder finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing director(s) of
such company and, in certain circumstances its shareholders, are obliged to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings without undue delay but not later than three weeks after the mandatory
insolvency reason occurred, _i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness. Non-compliance with these_
obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal
law.

In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under
German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will
presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period.
However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obligated) to file for the opening of
insolvency proceedings if the debtor is likely not to be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the
due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may
take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any
measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary
proceedings as far as these protective measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to
ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business. As part of such protective measures the court may
appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has
petitioned for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the
debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under
the supervision of a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter)—with this petition not being obviously
futile. The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The
duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s
property (which includes the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the
existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to
cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to
manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency
administrator. During preliminary proceedings a ‘‘preliminary creditors’ committee’’ (vorl¨aufiger

211


-----

_Gl¨aubigerausschuss) can be set up if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements: (i) a_
balance sheet total in excess of e4,840,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over-indebted), (ii) revenue of at least e9,680,000 in the twelve-month period prior to the last balance
sheet date and/or (iii) 50 or more employees. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to
participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to
influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency
administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter and Insolvenzverwalter), orders for ‘‘debtor in possession’’
proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and appointments of preliminary trustees (vorl¨aufiger
_Sachwalter). In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an_
individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible, i.e.,
not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the
interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall include a representative of the secured creditors, one for
the large and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees.

The court orders the opening (Er¨offnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (er¨offnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of_
impending illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor) or illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness
and (ii) there are sufficient assets _(Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the cost of the insolvency_
proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only
open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs
themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings
will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, the right to manage and dispose of the business
and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually the same
person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator), who is appointed by the insolvency court,
unless a debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In addition, the insolvency administrator
may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations, and
satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseschulden) will be preferred to any
insolvency liabilities created by the debtor prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings (including
such portion of an _in rem secured creditor’s claim which exceeds the amount obtained through a_
disposal of the relevant collateral).

For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of the opening of German insolvency
proceedings against the relevant Guarantor or any subsidiary subject to the German insolvency regime
would be the following:

- the right to administer and dispose of the relevant Guarantor’s or such subsidiary’s assets would
generally pass to the (preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorl¨aufiger) Insolvenzverwalter) as sole
representative of the insolvency estate;

- if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by
the relevant Guarantor’s or such subsidiary’s management after the opening of insolvency
proceedings are null and void by operation of law;

- if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (i.e., attachment) a security interest in part of the
debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null
and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings;

- claims against the relevant Guarantor or such subsidiary may generally only be pursued in
accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

- any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does
not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the
claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the
insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor in person need
to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency
proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the

212


-----

German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any individual enforcement action brought against the
debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been
opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the
time when insolvency proceedings commence). If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for
insolvency proceedings, a creditor acquires through execution (i.e., attachment) a security interest in
part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security
becomes null and void by operation of law upon opening of the insolvency proceedings. Accordingly,
unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata
basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are
generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after an insolvency petition has been filed to the
extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to
dispose of the relevant collateral (though, between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the
time when insolvency proceedings commence, such stay on enforcement requires a court order)
outside of the insolvency proceedings. The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to
enforce security, i.e., realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to
preferential rights (for example, liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security
transfer of title (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security
assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). Whether or not a secured creditor remains entitled,
after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor
depends on the type of security. However, even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the
relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred
satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds (Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement
proceeds minus certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets
(Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten), which, in the aggregate,
usually add-up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any) and are disbursed to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.
The amounts related to remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor (‘‘excess proceeds’’) will be
allocated to the insolvency estate and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings
(for example, fees for and expenses of the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as
the members of the creditors’ committee), after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed
among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including, to the extent their claims exceed the
enforcement proceeds of the security interests, the holders of the Notes. If the relevant Guarantor or a
subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grant security over that Guarantor or subsidiary or
its assets to creditors other than the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred
treatment of creditors secured by such security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to
the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting
from such collateral and after satisfaction of the secured creditors may not be sufficient to satisfy the
claims of the holders of the Notes. In addition, it may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if
any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency
proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other
non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a moveable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

An alternative distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan
(Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, in
principle, the consent of the debtor and the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with
specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt equity swap
through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity
conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap.

Realizing the value of the insolvency estate for distribution of the proceeds among the creditors is
commonly achieved by disposing of the debtor’s assets, or, as the case may be, by disposing of the
debtor’s business as a going concern. Through an insolvency plan, it is also possible to implement a
debt-to-equity-swap. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if
it may also file for preliminary ‘‘debtor in possession’’ proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In such a
case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than those with
respect to immoveable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor

213


-----

from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the
restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the
debtor is not already illiquid. During such period, the debtor shall, together with its creditors and a
preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter), prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be
implemented in formal ‘‘debtor in possession’’ proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency
proceedings have been opened.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency
law point of view, has to be dealt with separately _(i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under_
German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the
respective entities of a group, but rather the claims of and vis-`a-vis each entity have to be dealt with
separately.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of
the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who
becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally
rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. In an insolvency of a German borrower or
issuer, loans or other debt instruments (including notes) granted by a direct or indirect shareholder of
such borrower or issuer are subordinated, unless such shareholder is privileged. A shareholder is, for
example, privileged if the shareholder’s (direct or indirect) equity interest in the German borrower or
issuer is no more than 10% and the shareholder does not take a managing role in the German borrower
or issuer (so-called small shareholder’s privilege—Kleinbeteiligungsprivileg).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator may also
challenge transactions which are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected
prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. The administrator’s right to challenge
transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period
prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, which
would be based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amount to the
holders of the Notes, guarantee provided by the respective Guarantor or the Collateral provided by the
respective entity for the benefit of the holders of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) which, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions
during the ten-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency
proceedings. In the event such a transaction is successfully avoided (angefochten), the holders of the
Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received to the insolvency estate or to waive
the respective Guarantee or security interest and you would have a general unsecured claim solely
under the Notes without preference.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which term includes the
provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be voided in the following cases:

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunf¨ahig, i.e., unable to pay its debt when due) at the time when such act was taken and the
creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was
illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if
the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances
imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing);

- any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a

214


-----

time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (i) such act
was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or after such filing; (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the
filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time; or (iii) such act was taken during the
second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and
the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency
creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental effect);

- any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the
filing of the petition of the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of
such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time, or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opining of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;

- any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (for example, whereby a debtor grants security
for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if
it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings;

- any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the insolvency
creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act;

- any act that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to
the debtor or an equivalent claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during
the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the
filing of such petition; or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and

- any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to
a third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant or _B¨urge) (in which case the_
shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (for example, the relevant Guarantor) was unable to
pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had
been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the
case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the
insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the
debtor’s creditors. With respect to a ‘‘related party,’’ there is a general statutory presumption that such
party had ‘‘knowledge.’’ The term ‘‘related party’’ includes, subject to certain limitations, in the case of
debtors that are corporate persons, members of the management or supervisory board, shareholders
owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable
positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and persons
that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third party creditor who has obtained
an enforcement order but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of execution,
under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and
the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The
conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above
described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the
date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time
such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with the

215


-----

intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the
legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or
security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

_Parallel Debt_

Under German law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such security interests cannot be
held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes will not be
party to the security documents relating to the Collateral. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to
benefit from security under ‘‘accessory’’ Collateral, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the
creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a
claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under, in particular, the Notes and the Notes
Guarantees. The pledges governed by German law will directly secure the parallel debt only. The parallel
debt procedure has not been tested in court under German law, and there is no certainty that it will
eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity or unenforceability posed by German law.

**_The Netherlands_**

**_Insolvency Laws_**

The Issuer is incorporated under Dutch law. Accordingly, where the Issuer has its ‘‘center of main
interests’’ or an ‘‘establishment in the Netherlands’’, it may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings
governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain exceptions as provided for in the EU Insolvency
Regulation (no. 1346/2000/EC).

There are two applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law: (a) moratorium of payments
(surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable
the debtor to continue as a going concern, and (b) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily
designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the most
commonly used insolvency regime and may result in the transfer of parts of the company as a going
concern. A moratorium of payments almost always results in the debtor’s bankruptcy. Both insolvency
regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet).

Only the debtor can make an application for a moratorium of payments, and only if it foresees that it will
be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the application has been filed, a court will
immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium of payments and appoint one or more
administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive
moratorium of payments, but it will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than
one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than
one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured,
non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice
the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to
satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. A moratorium of payments will only affect unsecured,
non-preferential creditors.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the
claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The
debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public
Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings
for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are
generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative
priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in
proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from
special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately
from a moratorium of payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs;
however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of
execution of up to two months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order
pursuant to articles 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet); (b) a receiver (curator) can
force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the

216


-----

receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled
to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of
liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver
and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors
are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, moratorium of payment and bankruptcy
proceedings against the Issuer would allow secured creditors (and in case of suspension of payments
also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by
proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or moratorium of
payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of
up to two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a
preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on
assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must
be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory
stay of execution of security rights and other rights of up to two months, extendable by another period of
up to two months, may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to
enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time. If such time is not met, the receiver will be
entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of
the proceeds, meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may
be significant. Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may
not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to
the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance
or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when
moratorium of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In
addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the moratorium of
payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of
bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such
termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

Both in a definitive moratorium of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to
creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is:
(i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the
creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and
conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently,
Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments
proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a moratorium of payments or
bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed in a composition.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be
entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch
law means, in the case of a moratorium of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting
purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are
submitted to a receiver for verification, and the receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s
existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy
proceedings (for voting). In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s
verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to
establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in moratorium of payments the court will
decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders
of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S.
liquidation proceeding. The claim validation proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of
Notes to be delayed. Interest on the Notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted
unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the
extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any
rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a
bankruptcy.

217


-----

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the
creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence, the
Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt) obligations in favor of
the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors towards the holders of the
Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the Principal Obligations). The Dutch law security
interests will be granted to the Security Agent as security for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure
the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the
same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall
discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall
discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interest granted to secure
the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security and will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security except through the Security Agent. As a result, the
holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt concept has not been tested under Dutch law and, to the extent that
the security interests in the collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by
other parties, holders of the Notes will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interests in the collateral.

**_Sweden_**

_Insolvency proceedings under Swedish law_

Under Swedish law, a debtor company may be subject to one of two types of insolvency proceedings,
bankruptcy pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (1987:672), as amended (the ‘‘Swedish
**Bankruptcy Act’’), and reorganization pursuant to the Swedish Company Reorganization Act**
(1996:764), as amended (the ‘‘Swedish Reorganization Act’’).

In addition, a Swedish party will in principle be subject to insolvency proceedings covered by the EU
Insolvency Regulation if it has its cetner of main interest in Sweden. With regard to the parties
incorporated under the laws of Sweden any insolvency proceedings applicable to such party including
any and all of its assets (in Sweden and abroad) will, as a starting point and by virtue of Article 4 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (lex concursus).

The insolvency laws of Sweden may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, including, inter alia, the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well
as security interests and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. Hence, Swedish law may limit the
ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising
under the laws of other jurisdictions. The following sections include a brief and limited description of
certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Sweden.

_Bankruptcy pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act_

General

Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act, if a company is unable to rightfully pay its debts as they fall due
and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed insolvent and can be declared bankrupt
following a bankruptcy petition filed with the court by the debtor or by a creditor of the debtor.

When declared bankrupt, a receiver in bankruptcy (Sw. konkursf¨orvaltare) is appointed by the court and
will work in the interest of all creditors with the objective of realizing the debtor’s assets and distributing
the proceeds among the creditors. The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company
in such a way that the company’s creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The
receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to
close it down, depending on what is deemed preferable for all the creditors. In general, the receiver in
bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds
in accordance with statutory rules. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and control
of the company and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to
represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets. All creditors (unless they have a right to
separate an asset from the bankruptcy estate) wishing to assert claims against the company that is
declared bankrupt need to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings.

218


-----

Order of Priorities

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish
Rights of Priority Act (1970:979), as amended (the ‘‘Swedish Rights of Priority Act’’), which states the
order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings
competing claims have equal right to payment, in relation to the size of the amount claimed, from the
debtor’s assets. However, preferential or secured creditors, where such preference follows by law, have
the benefit of payment before other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: specific and
general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights are vested in certain specific property (see below)
and give the creditor right to payment out of such property. Such preferential and secured creditors may
also under certain circumstances enforce the security in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act
(Uts¨okningsbalken (1981:774)), or if the security is provided by way of a pledge on movable assets
(handpantr¨att), enforcement through private enforcement procedures as permitted pursuant to the
Swedish Bankruptcy Act. General preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent
company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights. Claims that do not
carry any of the abovementioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such
claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other.

_Limitations on Enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_

General

The Swedish Reorganization Act provides companies facing economic difficulty with an opportunity to
resolve these without being declared bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be presented
by the debtor or a creditor of the debtor. Corporate reorganization proceedings may as a main rule
continue for an initial period of three months from commencement but may, under certain conditions, be
extended for up to one year.

Administrator

An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the
interests of creditors. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for
important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization,
granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring,
pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the
administrator is required. However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the
transaction.

Reorganization Plan, Creditors Meeting and Creditor’s Committee

Upon an order by the court under the Swedish Reorganization Act, the administrator must notify the
creditors of the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the
proposed action to be taken to resolve the debtor’s problems. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which
the creditors will be given the opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization
should continue. Upon the request of any of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee
of at most three persons. The administrator shall, if possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior
to taking any important decisions.

Moratorium

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the debtor
and, during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue as normal. However,
the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell
due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted
should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor
will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security
during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession
of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a share
pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share certificates of such
company have been physically delivered to the agent.

219


-----

The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (offentligt ackord), which
means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition
must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to
vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims, vote in favor of such public
composition. Creditors with set-off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition
unless they wholly or partly waive their set-off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a
secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’
meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public composition is a binding
proceeding.

_Limitations on the Validity and Value of a Guarantee or Security Interest_

Corporate Benefit Rules

If a Swedish limited liability company provides any security interest or guarantee without receiving
sufficient corporate benefit in return, such security interest or guarantee will, according to the Swedish
Companies Act (the ‘‘Swedish Companies Act’’), in whole or in part, constitute a transfer of value from a
Swedish limited liability company (a ‘‘Swedish Company’’) which would be unlawful if: (i) the Swedish
Company would lack cover for its unrestricted equity capital after such value transfer; or (ii) if it would not
be considered prudent by the Swedish Company to undertake the value transfer after having taken into
consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks relating to the Swedish
Company’s business or the Swedish Company’s need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or
financial position.

This could be the case if, at the time the guarantee or security interest for the obligations of a third party is
provided, (i) the obligor of such obligation could be deemed unable to fulfill its obligation to indemnify
the Swedish Company if the guarantee is utilized or the security enforced and/or (ii) a Swedish company
provides any security interest or guarantee in respect of debt owed by a non-subsidiary of that Swedish
company without receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return.

The guarantees and security provided by the Swedish Companies are limited in accordance with the
above restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability
of such entities thereunder if required by the abovementioned restrictions relating to the distribution of
assets.

Financial Assistance

The Swedish Companies Act also prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a guarantee or security
interest for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company or any of
its group companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries) and a Swedish limited liability company may
not provide a guarantee or any security for the obligations of a parent or sister company, unless the
parent company of the group, to which the company and such parent or sister company belongs, is
domiciled within the EEA.

_Establishing a security interest_

General

In order to create a valid security interest under Swedish law, the property subject to such security
interest must fulfill the following criteria: (i) there must be an underlying debtor-creditor relationship in
respect of the obligations which the security purports to secure; (ii) the pledgor must grant the security
interest, typically in the form of a pledge agreement; and (iii) an act perfecting the security interest must
take place. The method for perfection varies depending on the asset type.

Under Swedish law, in addition to certain actions that must be taken to perfect a security interest by the
secured party and the grantor, for any security to be validly created, the grantor must be effectively
deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the assets subject to the security interest. Any
security interests purported to be created under Swedish law over assets which the security provider
may remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate or collect, invest and dispose of
any income from until the occurrence of an enforcement event would therefore not be effective until an
enforcement event has occurred and the security interests have been perfected. Such unperfected
secured assets are vulnerable under applicable provisions of Swedish law of being set aside as a
preference in any Swedish insolvency proceeding affecting the security provider. Thus, a security

220


-----

provider must be effectively deprived of its right to control, deal with or dispose of the secured assets,
and arrangements providing for the release of a security interest over an asset in connection with the
disposal thereof or upon the occurrence of other circumstances would be at risk of impairing the validity
of the security.

Shares

In the case of shares, the perfection of the pledge is achieved by transferring the share certificates
endorsed in blank to the possession of the pledgee. The pledgee is not entitled to vote the shares but is,
absent agreement to the contrary, entitled to any bonus shares and any new shares issued in rights
issues. Unless the pledgee and the pledgor agree otherwise, the pledgor is entitled to all dividends until
the bankruptcy date. The right to future dividends can however be pledged to the pledgee or to a third
party.

Receivables and Claims in General

Pledges can also be granted and perfected in receivables and other claims. Security over receivables
and claims are perfected by way of notification to the debtor of the underlying receivable. There is no
requirement as to the form for such notification. However, in order to obtain the intended result, the
pledgor or the pledgee should state that the receivable has been pledged to the pledgee. The notice
must also effectively prohibit the debtor of the underlying receivable to make any payments to the
pledgor.

The security over the trade receivables granted by Selecta AB will be unperfected until the pledgor may
no longer receive and retain payments under the trade receivables and a perfection notice has been
given to and acknowledged by the relevant debtor. According to the provisions of the relevant trade
receivables pledge agreement, such notice will only be given when an acceleration event has occurred
and is continuing.

Pledge over Insurances

Subject to any claims that have better priority under mandatory law, pledges can also be granted and
perfected over insurance proceeds. Security over insurance proceeds is perfected by way of notification
to the insurance company that the insurance proceeds have been pledged to the pledgee and that all
insurance proceeds shall be paid to the pledgee. In order to obtain the intended result, the notice must
effectively prohibit the pledgor from receiving any insurance proceeds.

The security over the insurance proceeds granted by Selecta AB will be unperfected until the pledgor
may no longer receive insurance proceeds under the insurances and a perfection notice has been given
to and acknowledged by the insurance company. According to the provisions of the relevant insurance
pledge agreement, such notice will only be given when an acceleration event has occurred and is
continuing.

Pledge over Trademarks

Pledges can also be granted and perfected over trademarks. Security over trademarks is perfected by
way of registration with the Swedish Patent and Registration Office that the trademarks have been
pledged to the pledgee.

Under the trademark security, the pledgor will be entitled to receive certain proceeds from the
trademarks such as license fees and royalties and the pledgor’s right to receive such proceeds may
invalidate the security purported to be created under the trademark security in respect of such proceeds.

_Challengeable Transactions_

In Swedish bankruptcy and, if certain conditions are met, company reorganization proceedings,
transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject to different time limits) be recovered. The goods
or monies shall then be re-distributed to the bankruptcy estate or the company subject to company
reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, where the debtor has conveyed
property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of one or more of its other creditors
before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest, granted a
guarantee or security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not
perfected without delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary or paid a debt that

221


-----

is considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or which is made by using unusual means
of payment.

In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions which were made
during the three months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings, notably
in relation to such granting of security where perfection is delayed. In certain situations longer time limits
apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations where the other
party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor, such
as a subsidiary or parent company.

Foreign Currency

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish kronor, but the judgment debtor
has the right to pay judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign currency, in Swedish kronor at
the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

Security Agent

It is generally possible under Swedish law to grant security interests in favor of an agent acting on behalf
of the secured parties.

However, it is not established by law or court precedent that a power of attorney or an appointment of an
agent (including any agent for service of process), can be made irrevocable. Therefore, any powers of
attorney or mandates of agency can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice
at the bankruptcy or temporal demise of the party giving such powers.

**_Switzerland_**

_Overview of Swiss Insolvency Proceedings_

In the event of the insolvency of any one of the Swiss Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be
initiated in Switzerland and Swiss insolvency laws would govern those proceedings. The insolvency
laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and
Bankruptcy (DEBA, Bundesgesetz ¨uber Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) may be less favorable to the
interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and
therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding
the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland currently in
force. Some parts of the relevant Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy
(Bundesgesetz ¨uber Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs)—especially concerning the composition
proceedings (Nachlassverfahren)—have been amended recently, having entered into force on
January 1, 2014.

Under Swiss insolvency laws, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no
consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a
group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency laws point of view, to be dealt with separately.
As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group,
but rather claims of and against each entity have to be dealt with separately.

Under Swiss insolvency laws, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but rather require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings based on an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings and the threat of
insolvency (as discussed in the paragraphs below). Moreover, insolvency proceedings must be initiated
by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] )
or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency laws in the event that the debtor has
obviously and permanently stopped paying its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently,
or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also
initiate insolvency proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunf¨ahig) before a court. Generally,
pursuant to the Swiss corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its
assets, which must be assessed pursuant to the accounting standards of the Swiss Code of Obligations
and on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn up (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s

222


-----

assets and (ii)—to the extent there is still a going concern scenario—based upon the going concern
value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued
at liquidation values nor at going concern values, the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the
insolvency court, provided that creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the
amount necessary to cover the overindebtedness (Art. 725 Swiss Code of Obligations). The debtor’s
board of directors is obliged to file for insolvency without delay and non-compliance with this obligation
exposes the board of directors to damage claims and, in extreme cases, to sanctions under criminal law.
Under certain circumstances, the auditors of an overindebted company are obliged to file for insolvency.

If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings it has to file an application for commencement of
enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office
(Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located
where the debtor is registered or resident. The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the
writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor
may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection
(Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No
reasons need to be given for the objection. The collection office notifies the creditor of the objection.

For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can, without any further delay, file an
application to lift this stay with the court (Rechts¨offnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an
enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional
lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechts¨offnung). In the
event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may, within 20 days, bring an
action in ordinary court proceedings for negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist
(Aberkennungsklage).

The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to issue a writ of continuation
(Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The
competent insolvency office delivers this writ of continuation to the debtor. The insolvency court may
take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and
required to secure the creditor’s rights. Within 20 days from receipt of the threat of insolvency
(Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition the opening of insolvency proceedings. The competent
insolvency court decides upon the insolvency without any delay, provided that there are no reasons
which would lead to a suspension of the insolvency court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right
to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the
insolvency court.

The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met,
in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the
assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue
insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency
proceedings themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the insolvency proceedings will be
closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the
insolvency office may request the insolvency court to resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings
(summarisches Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency
proceedings and the actual facts of the case are not complicated. Also, in such case, creditors have the
right to request ordinary insolvency proceedings.

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurser¨offnung), the right to administer and
dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt).
The insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate
(Konkursmasse), provided that certain acts require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’
meeting may appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a
creditors’ committee (Gl¨aubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency administration will be
competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate. The creditors’ committee has additional
competences.

Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for
those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property, and the relevant claims become due upon
insolvency. As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal
amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of
insolvency, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only

223


-----

secured claims enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the
collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover
such interests.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a segregation right
(Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings. Swiss insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no
longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with
the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to
enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings,
however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to
realize such security is vested with the insolvency administration.

Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or,
subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover
(i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to
satisfy unsecured creditors.

Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal
insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities of the debtor’s estate. Thereafter, all other claims
(insolvency claims—Konkursforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied
pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain privileged
classes of creditors, such as a debtor’s employees. Certain privileges can further result for the
government and its subdivisions based on specific provisions of federal law. All other creditors will be
satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate after the
security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full.

As an alternative solution to insolvency, the debtor (or, under certain circumstances, a creditor) may seek
a composition with creditors (Nachlassverfahren) by applying to the competent composition court
(Nachlassgericht) for a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) and submitting, besides other documents, a
tentative reorganization plan. The court immediately decides whether to grant the moratorium
provisionally (provisorische Stundung) for a maximum period of four months or not. With its decision the
court appoints a commissioner provisionally (provisorischer Sachwalter). In case during the period of
the provisional moratorium a reorganization of the company or a composition agreement
(Nachlassvertrag) appear promising, at a time before the provisional moratorium has expired, the court
approves the moratorium definitely and appoints a commissioner (Sachwalter). The court may, where
deemed necessary, also appoint a creditors’ committee (Gl¨aubigerausschuss) for the purpose of
supervising the commissioner. The commissioner convokes a meeting of creditors
(Gl¨aubigerversammlung) which has to approve the draft composition agreement according to specific
majority rules. The composition agreement (Nachlassvertrag) is subject to the approval of the
composition court. The Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (SchKG) provides for
three different types of composition agreements: The ordinary composition agreement (ordentlicher
_Nachlassvertrag), the composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit_
_Verm¨ogensabtretung) and the composition agreement in insolvency proceedings (Nachlassvertrag im_
_Konkurs)._

_Security under Swiss Law_

Other security (rights in rem) is enforced in accordance with the terms of the respective security
agreement. Typically, the security agreements provide for the right of a security agent acting on behalf of
the secured parties to enforce the security either by: (i) private realization (Private Verwertung) and set-off
of the proceeds against the secured obligations, or (ii) official enforcement proceedings pursuant to the
Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy, in which case the right of objection pursuant to
art. 41 DEBA (Einrede der Betreibung auf Pfandverwertung) is typically waived in the security
agreements. In such case, the parties also typically agree in advance that a private sale
(Freihandverkauf) will be admissible.

In the course of a private realization, the security agent acting on behalf of the secured parties may
acquire any or all of the pledged assets (Selbsteintritt). In case of an assignment of claims for security
purposes, the security agent will, on behalf of the secured parties, collect all assigned claims.
Alternatively, it is often entitled to sell such assigned claims to third parties by way of a private sale

224


-----

(Freihandverkauf) or acquire the assigned claims for its own account, in each case without having to
initiate proceedings under the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy.

After an insolvency has been declared, however, assets which are subject to a pledge and similar
security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse) and will be realized by the
insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which
provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement
are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditors and (iii) any excess
proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors.

Under Swiss law, certain ‘‘accessory’’ security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third
parties who do not hold the secured claim. The holders of the Notes will not be party to the security
documents relating to the collateral. In order for the holders of the Notes to benefit from ‘‘accessory’’
security interests and have a secured claim, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
will provide for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to the parallel debt, the security agent becomes
the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges
governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel debt. However, the parallel debt concept has not
been tested in court under Swiss law, and there is no certainty that it will be recognized and held valid
and enforceable under Swiss law.

**_United Kingdom_**

Certain of the Guarantors and providers of Collateral are incorporated in, maintain their respective
registered offices in and conduct their business and the administration of their interests on a regular
basis in and from England and Wales (each a ‘‘U.K. Obligor’’). On the basis of these factors, an English
court may conclude that the U.K. Obligors have their ‘‘center of main interests,’’ within the meaning of
the EU Insolvency Regulation, in England and therefore insolvency proceedings in England constituting
‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ under article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced
in respect of a U.K. Obligor.

_Overview of U.K. Insolvency Proceedings_

_Liquidation_

Priority of Claims in a U.K. Liquidation

Upon liquidation of any U.K. Obligor, the order of priorities is such that debts due by it to any holders of
fixed charges over U.K. assets are paid first out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to such fixed
charges (subject to the prior payment of the costs of preservation and realization of the fixed charge
assets). Where there are floating charges, liquidation expenses (discussed further below), preferential
creditors, and unsecured creditors to the extent of the ‘‘ring-fenced’’ fund (discussed further below) may
be paid out of the proceeds of realization of assets subject to those floating charges in priority to
payments to creditors secured by virtue of those floating charges. Thereafter, any debts owing to holders
of the floating charges would be paid to the extent they are secured by that charge. The categories of
preferential debts include certain amounts payable in respect of occupational pension schemes relating
to contributions due but unpaid and employee remuneration up to a specified amount. A certain part of
the net proceeds of the realization of the assets covered by a floating charge (up to a maximum of
£600,000, which are not preferential debts would be paid from the proceeds of realizations of unsecured
assets (if any) and, after the secured liabilities have been met, from the proceeds of realization of relevant
secured assets.

As discussed further below, certain of the security interests over U.K. assets expected to be created in
favor of the security agent will be expressed as fixed charges, but there is no certainty that the security
will take effect as a fixed charge and it may well take effect as a floating charge. Where no security is
provided to secure the obligations of a U.K. Obligor, any principal debt or guarantee obligation of that
U.K. Obligor will be unsecured.

Liquidation Expenses

The Insolvency Act 1986 (the ‘‘U.K. Insolvency Act’’) broadly states that in a liquidation of a company,
where the assets available for payment of its general creditors (excluding any amount ring-fenced for
unsecured debts as described above) are not sufficient to meet the liquidation expenses, certain

225


-----

specified liquidation expenses can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a
floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims.

In the case of litigation expenses, this is subject to rules restricting the application of this provision to
certain litigation expenses approved by the floating chargee and any preferential creditors or the court.
Consequently, realizations by secured creditors upon the enforcement of floating charges securing any
principal or guarantee obligation to the Noteholders could potentially be reduced by the amount of any
liquidation expenses. If any fixed security is validly created, any claims of creditors holding such fixed
security would rank ahead of any such liquidation expenses. The creditors holding the security would,
however, pay the expenses of realizing their security directly to the liquidator or other person (such as a
receiver or security trustee) who disposed of the secured assets on their behalf.

Administration

Administration is an insolvency procedure under the U.K. Insolvency Act pursuant to which a company
may be reorganized or its assets realized under the protection of a statutory moratorium. A company
may be put into administration either pursuant to a court order or via an out-of-court process. Broadly
speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the
application of, among others, the U.K. Obligor itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including
contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the U.K.
Obligor also has the right to appoint an administrator. In addition, he has the right to intervene in an
application made for administration proceeding by another person by nominating an alternative
administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the
appointment of an administrative receiver.

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration
order (in the case of court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (in the case of
an out of court appointment) is made. At the commencement of the appointment of an administrator, a
full statutory moratorium applies. Pursuant to both an interim and full moratorium of a U.K. Obligor, no
creditor could take any action against that U.K. Obligor, including, among other things, commencing a
legal process against the U.K. Obligor, winding up the U.K. Obligor or enforcing security or repossessing
goods in the U.K. Obligor’s possession under a hire purchase or similar agreement, without the
permission of the court or (in the case of a full moratorium) the consent of the administrator.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that
company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of
the moratorium in relation to a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, cash or financial
instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003.

Subject to the above points, were a U.K. Obligor to enter administration, it is possible that the security
granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Similarly, whilst any principal debt or
guarantee obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action
could be taken in respect of any failure to pay.

Expenses of the administration

Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify as expenses of the administration (and which include, among
others, expenses properly incurred by the administrator in performing his functions in the administration
and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration) enjoy priority status, in a
similar way to liquidation expenses (as described above) although the categories of expenses are
slightly different. In particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the realization
proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts
and floating chargees’ claims.

226


-----

Administration can be used as a proceeding in which to make distributions to creditors like a liquidation
in which case claims of creditors may be submitted to the administrator, although court approval
generally will be required before he can make a distribution to unsecured creditors. Time limits may be
set for receipt and processing of claims before interim dividends are paid.

_Small Companies Moratorium_

Certain ‘‘small companies’’ may, for the purposes of putting together proposals for a company voluntary
arrangement, seek court protection from their creditors by way of a ‘‘moratorium’’ for a period of up to
28 days, with the option for creditors to extend this protection for up to a further two months (although
the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills may, by order, extend or reduce the duration of
either period).

A ‘‘small company’’ is defined for these purposes by reference to whether the company meets certain
criteria relating to a company’s balance sheet, total turnover and average number of employees in a
particular period (although the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform may,
by order, modify the moratorium eligibility qualifications and the definition of a ‘‘small company’’).

During the period for which a moratorium is in force in relation to a small company, among other things,
no winding up may be commenced (except in very limited circumstances, for example where the U.K.
Secretary of State considers it to be in the public interest to do so) or administrator or administrative
receiver appointed to that company, no security created by that company over its property may be
enforced (except (i) with the leave of the Court or (ii) in the case of existence of eligible financial collateral
arrangements under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 whereby the
requirement to get a court order before enforcing security over small companies will not apply), no other
proceedings or legal process may be commenced or continued in relation to that company (except with
the leave of the Court) and the company’s ability to make payments in respect of debts and liabilities
existing at the date of the filing for the moratorium is curtailed. Certain small companies may, however,
be excluded from being eligible for a moratorium (although the Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills may, by regulations, modify such exclusions). As the law currently stands,
companies that on the date of filing are party to an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market
arrangement are excluded from being eligible for this small companies moratorium.

_Disposal of secured assets while subject to insolvency proceedings_

If a company is the subject of (i) a statutory moratorium as a result of either entering administration or
(ii) the small companies moratorium, and either (x) the holder of security created by that company (other
than financial collateral as above described) consents or (y) if the Court gives leave, the relevant
company or its administrator may dispose of the secured property as if it were not subject to the security.
In addition, an administrator can dispose of assets subject to a floating charge without seeking the
consent of the chargeholder or the leave of the Court.

Where the property in question is subject to a security which was created as a floating charge, the
chargee will have the same priority in respect of any property of the company directly or indirectly
representing the property disposed of as he would have had in respect of the property subject to the
security. Where the security in question is other than a floating charge, it shall be a condition of the
chargee’s consent or the leave of the Court that the net proceeds of the disposal shall be applied
towards discharging the sums secured by the security.

_Possible challenges to security interests_

Vulnerable transactions

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company would have certain powers to
apply to court to challenge transactions entered into by a U.K. Obligor if that U.K. Obligor is unable to
pay its debts (as defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act) at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to
pay its debts as a result of the transaction.

A transaction might be challenged in this way (as a transaction at an undervalue) if it involved the U.K.
Obligor making a gift or otherwise entering into a transaction on terms that it received no consideration,
or the U.K. Obligor received significantly less value than under the transaction it gave in return. Where an
undervalue transaction is proved, the court has powers to make any order it thinks fit in order to restore
the position to what it would have been had the U.K. Obligor not entered into that transaction. A court will

227


-----

not intervene, however, if it is satisfied that the U.K. Obligor entered into the transaction in good faith and
for the purposes of carrying on its business and if, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for
believing the transaction would benefit the U.K. Obligor. The court can set aside transactions at an
undervalue entered into by the U.K. Obligor within a period of two years ending with the onset of its
insolvency (as this date is more specifically defined in the U.K. Insolvency Act). In principle, both a
Guarantee granted by a U.K. Obligor or any Collateral provided by it could be challenged as a
transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction might also be challenged in this way (as a preference) where a U.K. Obligor has done
something or suffered something to be done which has the effect of putting a creditor, surety or
guarantor in a better position than the one that person would have been in the event of the U.K. Obligor
going into insolvent liquidation. A court will not intervene however when the U.K. Obligor, in deciding to
give the preference, was not, in deciding to give the act that amounted to a preference, influenced by a
desire to put this person in a better position in the event of insolvent liquidation. If the preference is given
to a person connected to the U.K. Obligor (other than an employee), the court can go back two years
from the date of the onset of insolvency. If the person is not connected to the U.K. Obligor, the court can
only look back and set aside those preferences entered into in the period of six months ending on the
onset of the U.K. Obligor’s insolvency.

Further, an administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction.
The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by a U.K. Obligor up to three years
before the day on which the U.K. Obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A
transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the
terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly
contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The U.K. Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by a company
during the ‘‘relevant time’’ may be invalid in whole or in part if certain conditions are met. In the case of a
floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to a U.K. Obligor, the relevant
time is deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of the U.K. Obligor’s insolvency
provided that at the time the charge was granted the U.K. Obligor was unable to pay its debts or became
unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted.
If the floating charge is created in favor of a person connected to the U.K. Obligor, the relevant look back
time is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency.

As a result of the rights to challenge described above, in the event that a U.K. Obligor becomes unable to
pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the issuance of the Notes, an administrator or liquidator
is appointed and the conditions contemplated in the relevant legal provisions are met, the provision of
the relevant Notes Guarantees and Collateral may be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or a
court may set aside the granting of the Notes Guarantees and Collateral as invalid.

_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by
the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend,
among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the U.K.
Obligor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the holder of the security in practice. Where a U.K. Obligor is free to deal with the assets that
are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the
court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to
attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant
fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in
its discretion and without the consent of the chargee.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any
unsecured creditors of the relevant U.K. Obligor in respect of that part of the U.K. Obligor’s net property

228


-----

which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined
preferential creditors of the U.K. Obligor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the
proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation
or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.

_Limitation on enforcement_

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the U.K. Obligors in respect of the obligations of another
group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be
allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the
above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent
security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may
be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with a U.K. Obligor in good faith, however the relevant
legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for
each U.K. Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the
Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would
be most likely to promote the success of the U.K. Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the
directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found
to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a
court.

_Equitable share charge_

The fixed charges over shares in companies incorporated in England and Wales granted by certain
Guarantors are equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor
transfers the beneficial interest in the shares to the chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies
in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the
discretion of the court.

_Account banks’ right to set-off_

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by a U.K. Obligor
over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an ‘‘Account
**Bank’’) may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under**
the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash
pooling or other arrangements with that U.K. Obligor. As a result, and if the security granted over those
accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank
accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect
to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has
crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain
insolvency events with respect to the relevant U.K. Guarantor) and the Account Bank has been formally
notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and
set-off rights, since the Account Bank will only be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights until
such time as it is informed that the beneficial interest in the debt represented by the account credit
balance has been transferred to a third party.

_Transaction defrauding creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was
made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against a company, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim
which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction
defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by
an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and
the U.K. Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by
the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation)
also bring an application to set aside such transaction. The challenge must be made within 12 years (or
in the case of claims for a sum of money, six years) from the date that the cause of action arose. The
relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines
that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit
to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to

229


-----

protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of,
or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was
entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from
a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances
and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and
without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the
transaction.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated or organized under the laws of the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Sweden, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Security Documents will generally be
governed by the laws of the jurisdictions where such assets are located or the laws of the jurisdiction of
organization of the Issuer and/or pledged equity securities. The Intercreditor Agreement will be
governed by the laws of England and Wales. The Indenture (including the Notes Guarantees) and the
Notes will be governed by New York law. The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the
Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since the assets of the Issuer and each of the
Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive officers are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person,
including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes
or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. Federal or state securities
laws, may not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the
Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the
jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and
the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action,
including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor or a security provider, investors
will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though
the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries
in which each of the Issuer and the non-U.S. Guarantors is located, you should consult with your own
advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere
outside the United States.

**The Netherlands**

The Issuer is incorporated under Dutch law and has its registered seat in the Netherlands. None of the
directors of the Issuer reside in the United States and all of the Issuer’s assets are located outside of the
United States. Civil liabilities based on the securities laws of the United States may not be enforceable in
the Netherlands, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. courts.

The United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any court in the United States, whether or
not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to
obtain a judgment which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a
competent Dutch court. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment
without re-litigation on the merits (i) if that judgment results from legal proceedings compatible with
Dutch notions of due process, (ii) if that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of
the Netherlands and (iii) if the jurisdiction of the relevant federal or state court in the United States has
been based on internationally accepted principles of private international law. Subject to the foregoing
and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be
able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in
the Netherlands. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In
addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an
original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

According to Dutch law, a legal or natural person is upon certain conditions entitled to elect a domicile
which is different from its physical or real domicile. However, our Dutch counsel is not aware of any
statutory or case law confirming that the principle referred to in the foregoing sentence also includes the
ability to validly elect a domicile outside the Netherlands for service of process purposes. Therefore, our
Dutch counsel recommends that, in the event of initiating legal proceedings against a party domiciled or
residing in the Netherlands, service of process is also effected upon it at its domicile or residence in the
Netherlands.

**Switzerland**

Judgments obtained against any of the Swiss Guarantors outside of Switzerland (and, in particular, in
the United States) may be recognized in Switzerland before a court of competent jurisdiction in

231


-----

accordance with the proceeding set forth by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law
(Bundesgesetz ¨uber das internationale Privatrecht) and the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure
(Schweizerische Zivilprozessordnung). Should the judgment concern a monetary payment or a security
(Geldzahlung oder Sicherheitsleistung), the enforcement proceedings are additionally governed by the
Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (Bundesgesetz ¨uber Schuldbetreibung und
_Konkurs)._

Should a treaty concerning the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments exist between
Switzerland and the other country in question, the recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment
would primarily be subject to the provisions of this treaty. The United States and Switzerland currently do
not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than
arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters.

In a proceeding based on the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber das
_internationale Privatrecht) and the Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische_
_Zivilprozessordnung) regarding the recognition and/or the enforcement of a foreign judgment, a Swiss_
court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the foreign court. The
recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a
number of conditions including those set out in articles 25 _et seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on_
International Private Law (Bundesgesetz ¨uber das internationale Privatrecht), which include:

- the Swiss court determines that the foreign court had jurisdiction;

- the judgment of such foreign court has become final and non-appealable;

- the recognition of the foreign judgment is not manifestly contrary to the public policy (schweizerischer
_Ordre public);_

- the counterparty has been properly served with process according to the law of the country of his/her/
its domicile or ordinary residence (if in Switzerland, through judicial aid granted by the Swiss
authorities) or the counterparty has unconditionally joined the proceedings;

- the proceedings leading to the judgment have respected the principles of a fair trial (as understood in
Switzerland) and, in particular, that the counterparty has been granted the right to be heard and the
possibility to properly defend his/her/its case; and

- no action between the same parties and on the same subject matter has been commenced or decided
first in Swiss court and no judgment between the same parties and on the same subject matter has
been first rendered by a foreign court, which judgment may be recognized in Switzerland.

Any judgment obtained against any of the Swiss Guarantors outside of Switzerland in any country bound
by the provisions of the Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters (Lugano-Ubereinkommen[¨] ) would be recognized and enforced in
accordance with the terms set forth in this convention.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from foreign courts in Switzerland. It cannot, however, be assured that any
attempts to enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful.

Regarding judgments by U.S. courts involving punitive damages, it has to be pointed out that the
recognition and enforcement of such punitive damages awards might be denied by Swiss courts as
incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public). Alternatively, a Swiss court may
reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that
they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Swiss civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect
to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the
proceedings, may prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the
depositions of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any
proceeding. In Switzerland, no such pre-trial discovery process exists. Instead, a Swiss court would
decide upon the claims for which evidence is required from the parties and the related burden of proof. It
is doubtful whether a Swiss court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were
commenced in Switzerland predicated solely upon United States federal or state securities laws. In
addition, in an action brought in a Swiss court on the basis of United States federal or state securities

232


-----

laws, the Swiss courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Awards of
punitive damages awarded in original actions outside Switzerland may also not be enforceable in
Switzerland.

**Sweden**

We have been advised by Swedish counsel that enforceability of a judgment rendered by a foreign court
in civil and commercial matters, is generally considered conditional upon that enforceability of such
judgment is expressly provided for under Swedish law or upon a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments. The United States and Sweden do not have a convention or
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters (although the United States and Sweden are both parties to the New York Convention on Arbitral
Awards). This means that a judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based
on civil liability would not be directly enforceable in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgment in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil
law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden, or an administrative
tribunal or executive or other public authority of the Kingdom of Sweden. In such an action, a judgment
rendered by any federal or state court in the United States may be regarded as evidence in respect of, for
example, factual circumstances or the content of U.S. law.

**France**

Certain Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or
principal places of business in France (the ‘‘French Entities’’). The directors, officers and other
executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the ‘‘French
**Persons’’). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Persons are located**
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process
upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon
the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it
may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities,
provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in
Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
entitlements connected with the Notes against the French Entities and/or the French Persons.

The French Entities have been advised by Latham & Watkins, their French counsel, that the United
States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment
rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon
U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur)
in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal de Grande Instance) that has exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is
satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case
law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

- such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is
clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the
choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction
over the matter;

- such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to
the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

- such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions
(i.e. those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S.

233


-----

judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in
France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S.
judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the
_res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared_
enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected
under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law
No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the
communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or
technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in
France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the
regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague
Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France
or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files
and individual liberties, as most recently modified by French Ordinance No. 2011 1012 of August 24,
2011) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from
French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern
their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French
international public policy (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an
action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have
the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can
sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French
Persons. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign
claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has
interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not
be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to
case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action
has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the
choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from
the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily
appearing before the foreign court.

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting
one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to
choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid on the ground that it was discretionary (potestative).
Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the
party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action
before the French courts.

**Germany**

The United States and Germany do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for payment of
money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, may not be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in
Germany.

234


-----

Notwithstanding, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would
generally be recognized by a German court upon all of the following:

- U.S. courts could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles on jurisdictional
competence according to German law;

- the document introducing the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner
that allowed for adequate defense;

- the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became _res judicata rendered by a_
German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which
is to be recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment is not in
contradiction to any such prior judgment;

- the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context,
it should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive
damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble
damages, will not be enforced in Germany. They are regarded to be in conflict with material principles
of German law;

- the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

- the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after
having received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above
principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance that
those judgments will be enforceable. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type
for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Enforcement is also subject to the effect
of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar
laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.

Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of
aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws
of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which
parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third
parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the
outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in
Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United States.
Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States will be regarded
by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A
German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the
judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**England and Wales**

The following discussion sets out the position with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court
judgments in England and Wales and is based upon advice provided to us by our English counsel. The
United States and the United Kingdom do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of court judgments in civil and commercial matters. A judgment rendered by any federal or
state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
securities law, would not be directly enforceable in England and Wales but such judgment would be
treated as constituting a cause of action against the judgment debtor in England and Wales and could
be sued on summarily in the English courts. The English courts should enter judgment against the
judgment debtor without re-examination of the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court
provided:

- the relevant U.S. court had jurisdiction to give the judgment;

235


-----

- the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum
payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or
otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public
law);

- the judgment is not for multiple damages (as defined by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980);

- the enforcement of such judgment would not contravene public policy in England and Wales;

- the enforcement of such judgment is not prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the
amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained);

- the English proceedings were commenced within six years after the date of the judgment;

- before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had not been the
subject of a final judgment of an English court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is
enforceable in England; and

- the judgment has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings, which are in breach of the principles
of natural justice.

It is uncertain whether an English court would impose liability on a judgment debtor in an action
predicated upon the U.S. federal securities law brought in England and Wales.

If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will
be enforceable by methods generally available to the English courts for this purpose. These methods
generally permit the court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. In addition, it may not be
possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to
any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against
the judgment creditor.

**Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements**

**31 March 2014**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

**2.1. General information**

Selecta Group BV (‘‘the Company’’) is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. The Company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as ‘‘the Group’’ or ‘‘the
Selecta Group’’. The Group is a European provider of food and beverage vending machine solutions.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not represent statutory financial
statements of the parent entity Selecta Group B.V.

**2.2. Accounting policies**

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. They do not include all information required for a complete set of
IFRS financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and
transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and
performance since the last annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended
30 September 2013.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies. The key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that
applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 September 2013.

**2.3. New and revised/amended standards and interpretations**

The Group has applied the following new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and revised
International Accounting Standards (IAS) as from 1 October 2013.

**IFRS 10—Consolidated Financial Statements**

This standard provides a single consolidation model that identifies control as the basis for consolidation
for all types of entities. It was applied retrospectively in compliance with the transitional provisions and
did not have material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.

**IFRS 11—Joint Arrangements**

This standard establishes principles for the financial reporting by parties to a joint arrangement. It was
applied retrospectively with the transitional provisions and did not have material on the Group’s
Financial Statements.

**IFRS 12—Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities**

This standard combines, enhances and replaces disclosure requirements for subsidiaries, joint
arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. The Group will modify its disclosures
accordingly at year-end.

**IFRS 13—Fair Value Measurement**

This standard applies to situations where other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements. It
defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and requires certain
disclosures about fair value measurements. It was applied prospectively, in accordance with the
transitional provisions and did not have a material impact on the Group’s Financial Statements.

The option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, known as the ‘corridor method’’ was
eliminated. Since Selecta Group already recognised actuarial gains and losses directly in other
comprehensive income before IAS 19 Revised became effective, this amendment had no impact on the
Group’s financial statements.

_Introduction of net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset_

Under IAS 19, the expected return on plan assets is based on the expected rate of return on the
investments in the plan. This method was replaced by the introduction of net interest on the net defined
benefit liability or asset.

The expected return under IAS 19 depends on the actual investment portfolio and is typically not equal to
the discount rate applied for the determination of the scheme liabilities. The net interest income under
IAS 19R is determined based on this discount rate rather than the expected rate of return.

_Change in the presentation of the defined benefit cost_

Under IAS19R, the defined benefit cost comprises service cost, net interest and remeasurements.
Service cost (current and past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements) and
net interest are recognised in profit or loss, while remeasurements (actuarial gains and losses, any
changes in the effect of the asset ceiling and the difference between (expected) net interest income and
the actual return) are recognised in other comprehensive income for retirement benefits and in profit or
loss for other long-term employee benefits.

_Introduction of more extensive disclosure requirements in the financial statements_

IAS19R introduced more extensive disclosure requirements relating to the characteristics, risks and
amounts in the financial statements regarding defined benefit plans, as well as the effect of defined
benefit plans on the amount, timing and uncertainty of the entity’s future cash flows. The Group will
present these additional disclosures for the first time in the annual financial statements.

_Recognition of past service costs in the period of a plan amendment_

Past service costs are recognised in the period of a plan amendment and unvested benefits are no
longer be spread over a future period until the benefits become vested.

IAS 19 Revised 2011 has been applied retrospectively in compliance with the transitional provisions of
the standard. The impact on the prior period financial statements has been disclosed in note 2.6.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**2.5. Statement of seasonality of interim operations**

Whilst the business of Selecta fluctuates from month to month, the impact between the first and second
six months is limited, and in addition seasonal fluctuations across the months offset each other to a
certain degree at group level.

**2.6. Restatement of prior years’ consolidated financial statements**

**IAS 19 Revised**

IAS 19 Revised became effective for the financial year beginning 1 October 2013. The Group has
adopted IAS 19 Revised retrospectively and has restated the comparative periods included in these
interim financial statements.

The quantitative impact of the above restatements is reflected accordingly in the consolidated statement
of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet and
statement of changes in consolidated equity.

The following tables summarise the impact of the above changes on the Group’s primary financial
statements. There is no impact of the restatement on the consolidated statement of profit or loss and
consolidated statement of comprehensive income since these are the first interim financial statements
prepared in accordance with IAS 34.

During the financial year ended 30 September 2013 the carrying value of the Group, including goodwill,
has been compared to its recoverable amount. It has been concluded that the recoverable amount
exceeds the carrying amounts and therefore no impairment is required to be booked.

In respect to the half year ended ended 31 March 2014 management has reviewed whether there are any
indications of impairment which would trigger the requirement to perform an impairment test at 31 March
2014 and concluded that there are no such indications of impairment.

**6.** **Other intangible assets**

Other intangible assets consists primarily of trademarks and customer contracts.

The trademark recognised by the Group represents the brand name and has an indefinite useful life.
Therefore this trademark is tested for impairment annually.

During the financial year ended 30 September 2013 in undertaking the impairment test, the Group has
used the same projections and parameters as used in the goodwill impairment test, and has included in
the calculation of the WACC an asset specific risk premium of 0.5%. Based on these factors, the
recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount and therefore no impairment is required to be
booked.

In respect to the half year ended ended 31 March 2014 management has reviewed whether there are any
indications of impairment which would trigger the requirement to perform an impairment test at 31 March
2014 and concluded that there are no such indications of impairment.

The customer contracts recognised by the Group are resulting from the acquisition by the Group of
customer contracts in the business combination, have a finite useful life and are amortised over the
determined life time of 15 years.

**10. Pledged assets**

In order to secure the Group’s borrowings, Selecta Group B.V. has pledged its shares in Selecta AG as
security in favour of the lenders. As Selecta AG owns, directly or indirectly, all of the other subsidiaries of
the Group and as the only material asset on Selecta Group B.V.’s own balance sheet is cash at bank
which is subject to a separate pledge as security in favour of the lenders, in effect all of the assets of the
Group are pledged as security. The Group is not allowed to pledge these assets as security for other
borrowings, except in the limited circumstances as stated in the senior and mezzanine facility
agreements.

**11. Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries**

On 29 February 2012 the Group disposed of 100% of the shares of Selecta Italia S.p.A..

The value of the net assets disposed of as reported in the year ended 30 September 2012 included
provisions for certain contingent liabilities which the Group expected to incur. In the second half of 2013
these contingent liabilities were settled, which resulted in a disposal gain of e 202’000.

**Report of the Independent Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements to the Board of**
**Directors of**

**Selecta Group B.V., Amsterdam**

As independent auditor, we have been engaged to audit the accompanying consolidated financial
statements of Selecta Group B.V. (‘‘the Company’’), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as
at September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated statements of profit or loss, consolidated
statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in consolidated equity and consolidated
cash flow statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2013, and
notes thereto, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

_Board of Directors’ Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements_

The board of directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and for such
internal control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

_Auditor’s Responsibility_

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the board of directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

_Opinion_

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of
the Company as at September 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, and of its financial performance and its cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2013 in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

_Other Matter_

This set of consolidated financial statements has voluntarily been prepared by the Board of Directors.
Our report thereon has been prepared at the request of the Board of Directors and does not represent a
statutory auditor’s report required in accordance with the laws and regulations in the Netherlands.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

**2.1. General information**

Selecta Group BV (‘‘the Company’’) is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. The Company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as ‘‘the Group’’ or ‘‘the
Selecta Group’’. The Group is a European provider of food and beverage vending machine solutions.
These financial statements do not represent statutory financial statements of the parent entity Selecta
Group B.V.

**2.2. Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of
certain financial instruments. The principal accounting policies are set out below.

These financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2013 have been re-issued with
comparatives for the years ended 30 September 2012 and 2011. As a result these financial statements
have been amended to include the following::

- Restatement of the amounts originally included in the year ended 30 September 2011, and hence the
opening balance at 1 October 2010, in respect of the company’s long service awards (jubilee benefits)
in Switzerland (see note 2.7)

- Presentation of segmental information (see note 36)

**2.3. Accounting policies**

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Group has adopted all International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS) issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (the IASB) as well as Interpretations given by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee (the IFRIC) and the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) that are relevant to the Group’s
operations and effective for annual reporting periods beginning on 1 October 2012.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are
disclosed in note 2.6.

**2.4. New and revised/amended standards and interpretations**

Several new and amended standards and interpretations were adopted in these consolidated financial
statements. These are either not relevant to the Group’s operations or have no material impact on the
Group’s overall results and financial position.

The expected impact of each new or amended Standard or Interpretation which is relevant to the Group
is presented below. There are no other new or amended standards or interpretations which have been
published and become effective on or after 1 October 2012 that are relevant to the Group’s operations.

**IFRS 9—Financial Instruments**

The standard addresses the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.
IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortised cost or
fair value, replacing the many different rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on how an entity
manages its financial instruments (its business model) and the contractual cash flow characteristics of
the financial assets. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. The
Group is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

**IFRS 10—Consolidated Financial Statements**

This standard provides a single consolidation model that identifies control as the basis for consolidation
for all types of entities. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group Financial Statements.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**IFRS 11—Joint Arrangements**

This standard establishes principles for the financial reporting by parties to a joint arrangement and is
currently being evaluated by Selecta. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group Financial
Statements.

**IFRS 12—Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities**

This standard combines, enhances and replaces disclosure requirements for subsidiaries, joint
arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. It is not expected to have a material
impact on the Group Financial Statements.

**IFRS 13—Fair Value Measurement**

This standard applies to situations where other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements. It
defines fair value, sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and requires certain
disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard will require the Group to make certain
additional disclosures but is not expected to have a material impact on the Group Financial Statements
otherwise.

**IAS 19 Revised 2011—Employee Benefits**

The main changes required by IAS 19 revised (‘‘IAS 19R’’) are as follows:

_Full recognition of deficit or surplus on the balance sheet_

The option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, known as the ‘corridor method’’ will be
eliminated. Since Selecta Group already recognises actuarial gains and losses directly in other
comprehensive income this amendment has no impact on the financial statements.

_Introduction of net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset_

Under IAS 19, the expected return on plan assets is based on the expected rate of return on the
investments in the plan. This method will be replaced by the introduction of net interest on the net
defined benefit liability or asset.

The expected return under IAS 19 depends on the actual investment portfolio and is typically not equal to
the discount rate applied for the determination of the scheme liabilities. The net interest income under
IAS 19R is determined based on this discount rate rather than the expected rate of return. When the
discount rate is lower than the expected return, the application of IAS 19R will result in an increase to the
defined benefit cost recognised in profit or loss.

Under IAS 19, the employer’s net service cost is determined as the gross service cost for the plan less
the cash contributions paid by the employee in the respective accounting period. Under IAS 19R, the
employer’s net service cost will be determined as the gross service cost less the actuarial value of the
employee contributions for the respective accounting period calculated using the Projected Unit Credit
Method. IAS 19R requires the employee contributions to be allocated to periods of service in the same
way as benefits are allocated to the employee’s active service. This is expected to impact the defined
benefit obligation and service cost for all pension plans for which employee contributions increase with
age.

For Selecta Switzerland, which represents 90% of the total defined benefit plans of the whole Selecta
Group, the defined benefit cost recognised in profit or loss would have been approximately e 0.1 million
lower had the Group applied IAS 19R for the 2013 consolidated financial statements.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

_Change in the presentation of the defined benefit cost_

Under IAS19R, the defined benefit cost comprises service cost, net interest and remeasurements.
Service cost (current and past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements) and
net interest are recognised in profit or loss, while remeasurements (actuarial gains and losses, any
changes in the effect of the asset ceiling and the difference between (expected) net interest income and
the actual return) are recognised in other comprehensive income for retirement benefits and in profit or
loss for other long-term employee benefits.

_Introduction of more extensive disclosure requirements in the financial statements_

IAS19R introduces more extensive disclosure requirements relating to the characteristics, risks and
amounts in the financial statements regarding defined benefit plans, as well as the effect of defined
benefit plans on the amount, timing and uncertainty of the entity’s future cash flows.

_Recognition of past service costs in the period of a plan amendment_

Past service costs will be recognised in the period of a plan amendment and unvested benefits will no
longer be spread over a future period until the benefits become vested.

**2.5. Significant accounting policies and valuation methods**

**2.5.1. Basis of consolidation**

**Subsidiaries**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) see note 27. Control is achieved where the Company has
the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its
activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss and consolidated cash flow statement from the effective date of acquisition or
up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their
accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group and the IFRS.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are
identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of
those interests at the date of the original business combination (see below) and the minority’s share of
changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to non-controlling interests in a
subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling
interests to have a deficit balance.

**Joint ventures**

The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by proportional consolidation. The
Group combines its share of the joint ventures’ individual income and expenses, assets and liabilities
and cash flows on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Group’s financial statements. The Group
recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets by the Group to the joint venture that is
attributable to the other joint venture partner. The Group does not recognise its share of profits or losses
from the joint venture that result from the group’s purchase of assets from the joint venture until it resells
the assets to an independent party. However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the
loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss.

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**2.5.2. Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of
the business combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of
assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for
control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. The
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition
under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except
for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at
fair value less costs to sell.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess
of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of
the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit
or loss.

The non-controlling interest in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s
proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

**2.5.3. Foreign currencies**

**Foreign currencies in individual financial statements**

The functional currency of each group company is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which the entity operates, with certain exceptions. For the purpose of the consolidated financial
statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated in Euros (‘‘EUR’’ or ‘‘e’’), which
is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. Euro is the currency that
management uses when controlling and monitoring the performance and financial position of the
Group.

Transactions in currencies other than the group company’s functional currency (foreign currency
transactions) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date on which the transactions were
entered into, or a close approximation thereof. At each balance sheet date, monetary items
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items are maintained at the historical exchange rates and are not retranslated.

Exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

**Foreign currencies in consolidated financial statements**

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s
foreign operations are expressed in Euros using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange
rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the
transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as other comprehensive
income and transferred to the Group’s currency translation reserve. Such exchange differences are
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is
disposed of.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets
and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

**2.5.4. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.

The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:

Land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Infinite (no depreciation is applied)
Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 to 60 years
Vending equipment . . . . . . . . . 4 to 8 years
Vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Machinery & Equipment . . . . . . 8 years
IT Hardware . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 to 5 years

Each significant part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that is different from
that of the asset to which it belongs is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values
and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate
accounted for on a prospective basis.

Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the
same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is
recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**2.5.5. Intangible assets**

**Goodwill**

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
subsidiary recognised at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the Group is deemed to be one cash-generating unit. This
cash-generating unit is tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the unit
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the amount attributable to goodwill is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.

**Other intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from
goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their value can be measured reliably.

**Brand name**

The brand name recognised by the Group has an indefinite useful life and is not amortised. Each period,
the useful life of this asset is reviewed to determine whether events and circumstances continue to
support an indefinite life assessment for the asset. Additionally, the brand name is tested for impairment
annually, and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.

**Customer contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life and are amortised over the determined life time of 15 years.

**Software**

Software licences recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that they will generate future
economic benefits. They are amortised using the straight-line method over five years.

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as
incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and
unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets and are amortised
by the straight-line method over five years when the following criteria are met:

- it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

- management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

- there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

- it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and

- the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

F-31


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development
expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development
costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Other software licences and software development costs are expensed as incurred. No intangible asset
arising from research (or from research phase of an internal project) is recognised. Expenditure on
research (or on the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense when it is
incurred.

**2.5.6. Impairment of non-current assets other than goodwill**

At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its tangible and
intangible assets other than goodwill and property, plant and equipment may be impaired. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual
asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are
also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group
of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

**2.5.7. Prepayments and accrued income**

Prepayments and accrued income comprise payments made in advance relating to the following year,
and income relating to the current year, which will not be received until after the balance sheet date.
Prepayments are measured at the nominal amount of the payments. Accrued income is measured at
amortised costs.

**2.5.8. Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value corresponds
to the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less point-of-sales costs. A valuation
allowance on inventories is recorded, when the cost of inventories is greater than their net realisable
value.

**2.5.9. Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers**

Rebates and other amounts received from suppliers include agreed discounts from suppliers’ list prices,
value and volume-related rebates. Income from value and volume-related rebates is recognised based

F-32


-----

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

on actual purchases in the period as a proportion of total purchases made or forecast to be made over
the rebate period. Agreed discounts relating to inventories are credited to the statement of profit or loss
as the goods are sold. Rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the balance sheet date
are deducted from their carrying values so that the costs of inventories are recorded net of applicable
rebates. Rebates received in respect of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the costs
capitalised.

**2.5.10.** **Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market. They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment losses. An impairment loss on
trade receivables is recognised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The impairment loss is calculated as
the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate.

**2.5.11.** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents comprise
cash on hand, cash in points-of-sale, call deposits with banks, and other short-term, highly liquid
financial assets with original maturities of three months or less.

Due to the Group’s business model, significant cash balances are held at year-end on behalf of the
Group by external cash collecting firms, or en route to or from such cash counting firms. These amounts
are included in other current assets.

Bank overdrafts are included within current liabilities on the balance sheet.

**2.5.12.** **Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value
of money and the risks specific to the liability.

When some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be recovered from a
third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that recovery will be received
and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

**2.5.13.** **Borrowings and other financial liabilities**

Borrowings and other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs)
and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the
borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings and other financial liabilities are classified as
current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
twelve months after the balance sheet date.

**2.5.14.** **Derivative financial instruments**

The Group uses from time to time interest rate swaps and caps as hedges to manage its exposure to
interest rate risk. Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is
entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The
resulting gain or loss is recorded in the statement of profit or loss.

**2.5.15.** **Accruals and deferred income**

Accruals and deferred income comprise expenses relating to the current year, which will not be paid until
after the balance sheet date and income received in advance, relating to the following year. Deferred
income is measured at the nominal value of the payments received less, if appropriate, cumulative
amortisation in accordance with IAS 18. Accruals are measured at amortised cost.

**2.5.16.** **Taxation**

The charge for current income tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are
non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates of the countries where the Group has
operations.

Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of
temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.

Deferred income tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred
income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it can be reasonably expected that taxable profits will
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities, which affects neither taxable nor
accounting income.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the
year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Current tax and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it
relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case it is also
recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right
exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

**2.5.17.** **Employee benefits**

The Group maintains various defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. The pension plans
in Switzerland have been set up on the basis of the Swiss method of defined contributions but do not
fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the Swiss
pension plans are treated as defined benefit pension plans.

Defined benefit obligations are largely covered through pension plan assets of pension funds that are
legally separated and independent from the Group. These are managed by a board of trustees
consisting of representatives of the employees and the employer. The organisation, management and
financing of the pension plans comply with the applicable pension regulations. Employees and
pensioners or their survivors receive statutorily determined benefits upon leaving the company or
retiring as well as in the event of death or disability. These benefits are financed through employer
contributions and employee contributions.

**Defined benefit plans**

In the case of defined benefits pension plans, the pension expenses and obligations are valued
according to the projected unit credit method. The corresponding calculations are carried out yearly by
independent qualified actuaries.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

The pension expenses recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the defined benefit
pension plans correspond to the actuarially determined expenses minus the employee contributions
and are charged as employee benefits expense.

All actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit obligations as well as on the fair value of defined benefit
plan assets are charged or credited in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income.

Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and is
otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the
defined benefit obligation as adjusted for as yet unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the
fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service
cost, plus the present value of available refunds from the plan and reductions in future contributions to
the plan.

**Defined contribution plans**

In the case of defined contribution pension plans, the Group has no further payment obligations once
the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an expense when the employees
render the corresponding service to the Group, which normally occurs in the same year in which the
contributions are paid. Payments made to state-managed plans are dealt with as payments to defined
contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a
defined contribution pension plan.

**2.5.18.** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, excluding trade discounts, value added tax and similar sales
taxes.

**Sale of goods**

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are delivered to the client site or when
goods are purchased from a machine by a customer, depending on the contract terms.

Revenue may be received directly in the form of cash from the consumer, or may be invoiced to a client
periodically.

Where revenue is received in the form of cash, the amount recognised is the amount of cash received
until the last date on which the cash was collected from the machine, plus an estimate of the sales
between this date and the period end calculated based on historical trends.

Where the sale of goods is invoiced to the client, the amount recognised is based either on the amounts
delivered to the client or based on the consumption in the machines, depending on the specific
contractual terms. Where revenue is recognised based on consumption in the machines, the amount
recognised is based on the last recorded consumption from the machine plus an estimate of the sales
between this date and the period end calculated based on historical trends.

**Rendering of services**

Selecta also provides services to clients in the form of machine rentals, technical services and hygiene
services. Where the income is a fixed amount for the period the amount of revenue recognised is based
on this fixed amount. Where the income is dependent on the work performed, the revenue is recognised
based on records of technical site visits or other services provided.

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Interest income**

Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest rate, that is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net
carrying amount of the financial asset.

**Dividend income**

Dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

**2.5.19.** **Operating expenses**

Operating expenses comprise the materials and consumables used, employee benefits expense,
maintenance expenses, administrative expenses, travel and representation expenses, rent expenses
and depreciation and amortisation expenses.

**2.5.20.** **Leases**

The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of property, plant and equipment where
the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased
property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated
between repayment of the outstanding liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental
obligations, net of finance charges, are included in non-current liabilities or current liabilities as
appropriate. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the statement of profit or loss over the
lease period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the
shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term.

Other lease agreements are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as
an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**2.5.21.** **Purchasing income**

The Group receives certain rebates from its suppliers in respect of the purchase of vending machines
and consumables. Where the rebates are received in respect of vending machines which are capitalised
within property, plant and equipment, the cost of those vending machines is reduced by the amount of
the rebate received. In relation to vending machines and consumables sold to customers and
recognised within revenue, the cost of goods sold and the cost of inventories are reduced by the amount
of the rebate received.

**2.5.22.** **Finance costs**

Finance costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss on an accruals basis.

Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and finance leases calculated using the
effective interest method, fair value losses on derivatives classified as held for trading and foreign
exchange losses. Foreign exchange gains and losses are reported on a net basis as either finance
income or finance expense depending on whether the total foreign currency movements represent a
gain or a loss accordingly.

**2.6. Key sources of estimation uncertainties**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience
and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are discussed below.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**2.** **Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives**

In accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 2.5.5, the cash-generating unit to which
goodwill has been allocated and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for
impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. The recoverable
amounts of cash generating units and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are determined based
on their values in use. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions consistent with
the most up-to-date business plans that have been formally approved by management. The amounts
and key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are set out in notes 11 and 12 to the
consolidated financial statements.

**Customer Contracts**

Intangible assets resulting from the acquisition by the Group of customer contracts in a business
combination have a finite useful life and are amortised over the determined life time of 15 years. The
Group actively monitors retention rates on customer contracts and considers other relevant factors
which may provide an indication of impairment. The amounts are described in note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements.

**Employee benefits**

The present value of the pension obligations depends on a variety of factors that are estimated annually
by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions, including the discount rate to be applied to
determine the present value of defined benefit obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate,
the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the
currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of
the related pension liability. The amounts and principal assumptions used are described in note 22 to the
consolidated financial statements.

**Deferred income tax assets**

Deferred income tax assets on unused tax losses carried forward are recognised when it is probable that
there will be future taxable profits against which the losses can be offset. The assessment of
recoverability of the recognised deferred income tax assets is based on assumptions regarding future
profits and is derived from the latest budgets and business plans of the Group. The amounts are
described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is based on management’s best estimate of the consideration
required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and
uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

Provisions for warranties are ordinarily determined by product line and are based on statistics including
the likelihood of a break down occurring and the average cost of repair or replacement.

The amounts are described in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.

**Sales estimations**

Where sales are based on consumption in the machines, there may be a timing difference between the
date on which the cash was last collected from the machines or the date on which the sales readings
were taken. In this case an estimate of the sales between the date of the last cash collection or the last

machine reading and the end of the period is made. The estimate is based on historical sales trends in
respect of the specific client sites and machines. The estimated amount of sales which have been neither
collected in cash or invoiced to customers are recorded as Accrued income and uncollected cash in
points-of-sale, as disclosed in Note 17.

**Inventories**

Food and beverage inventories which have passed their sell by date are fully provided against. Similarly,
where the level of food and beverage inventories held exceeds the sales expected to be achieved before
the sell by date, a provision is made for the excess inventory held.

Provisions for vending equipment in inventory are recorded against vending machines in inventory
according to the age of the machine, as follows:

**Age of vending equipment** **Provision to be made**

< 1 year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . No provision necessary

- 5 years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100%

Provisions for spare parts held in inventory are calculated according to the inventory turnover ratio.

Provisions for inventories are disclosed in Note 15.

**2.7. Restatement of prior years’ consolidated financial statements**

**Long service awards**

Employees of Selecta Switzerland are entitles to long service awards (jubilee benefits) after completing a
certain number of years of service. These awards may be taken as either cash payments or as additional
vacation days.

In prior years no provision has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, whilst the charge to the
consolidated statement of profit or loss has been based on the actual amounts paid in the year rather
than the expense incurred in accordance with IFRS.

The calculation of the amounts to be included in the consolidated financial statements requires an
actuarial valuation to be performed as it is based on detailed assumptions of expected service length,
current service length, date of entry, monthly salary, gender, long service awards paid out to employees
in previous periods.

The quantitative impact of the restatement is reflected accordingly in the consolidated statement of profit
or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, statement of
changes in consolidated equity and disclosure Notes 5 Employee benefits expenses, 24 Provisions,
9 Income taxes and 20 Deferred income taxes.

The following tables summarise the impacts of the above changes on the Group’s primary financial
statements.

of services are often incorporated into one contractual price, it is not possible to split revenue into these
categories. Therefore the Group has disclosed instead the allocation of revenue used for internal

**Impairment testing**

During the financial year the carrying value of the Group, including goodwill, has been compared to its
recoverable amount. It has been concluded that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amounts
and therefore no impairment is required to be booked.

**Summary of goodwill impairment testing**

In undertaking the impairment test, the Group has used post-tax cash flow projections for the
computation of value in use based on the latest forecasts approved by management covering a
three-year period. In years four and five the Group assumes further growth, resulting in an increase in
profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of 3.0% (2012: 3.1% for year four and 5.5% for
year five, 2011: 5.0% for year four and five).

Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of 1.5% per
annum (2012: 1.5%, 2011: 1.5%).

These cash flows are discounted using a post-tax WACC for the Group of 6.1% (2012: 6.0%, 2011: 6.4%),
equivalent to a pre-tax WACC of 7.7% (2012: pre-tax WACC of 7.6%, 2011: pre-tax WACC of 8.1%)). This
WACC has been arrived at by taking the 10 year risk free rates for the countries in which the Group
operates, weighted by the operating cash flow generated by each country, and applying the following
assumptions:

� Market premium . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.55%

� Beta (unlevered) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.55

� Long term debt to equity ratio . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20.5%

� Debt premium . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4.0%

� Group blended tax rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26.5%

Management is confident that the forecasts are realistic and achievable and are supported by underlying
business initiatives, and therefore that no impairment of the carrying amount of the goodwill in respect of
the Group is required.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**11. Goodwill (continued)**

**Sensitivity to change in assumptions**

Assuming consistent future cash flows as applied in the impairment test summarised above, the post-tax
WACC would need to increase to 9.9% (2012: 8.7%, 2011: 8.4%) in order to eliminate all of the
headroom.

Assuming use of the Group post tax WACC of 6.1%, (2012: 6.0%, 2011: 6.4%) and assuming that the
three-year forecast is achieved, long term growth rates would need to fall
to �3.7% (2012: �2.0%, 2011: �1.1%) for all of the headroom to be eliminated.

Therefore management believes that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would
cause the carrying amount of the Group to exceed its recoverable amount.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**12. Other intangible assets (continued)**

The trademark recognised by the Group represents the brand name and has an indefinite useful life.
Therefore this trademark is tested for impairment annually.

The trademark was regarded as having an indefinite useful life when it was acquired because based on
an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there was no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset
was expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. In effect the Group continuously renews the
trademark and still expects to consume the future economic benefits embodied in the trademark
indefinitely. Management are still of the opinion that an amortisation of that asset over a fixed maximum
period would not faithfully represent the underlying asset held.

In undertaking the impairment test, the Group has used the same projections and parameters as used in
the goodwill impairment test, and has included in the calculation of the WACC an asset specific risk
premium of 0.5%. Based on these factors, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by
e 46.6 million (2012: e 73.6 million, 2011: e 15.0 million) and therefore no impairment is required to be
booked.

To eliminate the headroom the post-tax asset specific discount rate should increase by approximately
0.8% from 6.6% to 7.4%(2012: increase by approximately 1.3% from 6.5% to 7.8%, 2011: increase by
approximately 0.2% from 6.9% to 7.1%) or the long-term growth rate would need to decrease from 1.7%
to 0.7% (2012: decrease from 1.5% to �0.1%, 2011: decrease from 1.5% to 1.1%).

**13. Interest in joint venture**

During financial year 2009/2010 the Group formed, along with its venture partner, a new joint venture,
UTE. The Group took a 50% interest in the new company, whose principal activity is the provision of
vending services in Catalonia, Spain. The amounts included in the Group’s statement of profit or loss
and balance sheet in respect of the Group’s share of the joint venture are as follows:

The average credit period on sales of goods is 30 days. No interest is charged on the trade receivables
until the end of the credit period, thereafter the charging of interest is at the discretion of local
management depending on the amounts and customers involved. Where interest is charged in respect
of an overdue receivable the interest rate applied is between 3% and 15% per annum depending on the
country and the customer contract.

The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 360 days because historical experience indicates
that receivables that are past due beyond 360 days are not recoverable. Trade receivables between
30 days and 360 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of
goods, determined by reference to past default experience.

Depending on the size of a potential new customer and the volume of trading expected, prior to
accepting new credit customers, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential
customer’s credit quality and defines a suitable credit limit for the customer.

(2012: e 7.4 million, 2011: e 7.4 million) which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has
not provided for as there has not been any significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still
considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The ageing of

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit
quality of the trade receivable at the reporting date. This is in most cases evidenced by the age of the
receivable, and the Group has implemented specific policies regarding the level of provision required for
the change in credit quality based on the ageing of the receivable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the fact that the Group has a very large customer base
and a mix of credit and cash sales. Accordingly, management believes that there is no further credit
provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Under the terms of the Group’s Senior Facilities Agreement and Mezzanine Facilities Agreement, the
Group is obliged to meet certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. The financial covenants and
their underlying calculations are as follows:

- Cashflow cover: represents the ratio of Consolidated Cash Flow of the last twelve months to Net Debt
Service of the last twelve months.

- Debt cover: the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt at the end of the quarter to Consolidated EBITDA
of the last twelve months.

- Interest cover: the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA of the last twelve months to Consolidated Net Finance
Charges of the last twelve months.

In addition, the Agreements impose a limit on the maximum Capital Expenditure which may be incurred
during the course of a financial year, and if in any financial year the amount of Capital Expenditure spent
is less than the maximum amount permitted for that financial year, the maximum spend for the following
year is increased by the amount of such underspend.

The Group has complied with all of its covenant obligations in both the current and all previous financial
years.

In connection with the acquisition of the Group and the financing of the acquisition by the bank
syndicate, Selecta AG pledged shares of certain of its subsidiaries to the bank syndicate as security.

**Total unused tax losses carried forward . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **180’071** **156’121** **129’509**

These deferred income tax assets have not been recognised as it is not probable that future taxable
profits will be available to utilise the losses.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that
would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such amounts are
currently regarded as permanently reinvested. The parent is not only able to control the distribution of
dividends but has also no plan for any such distribution.

The fair value of the finance lease liabilities approximately equals their carrying amount.

**22. Retirement benefit obligations**

**Defined contribution plans**

The Group operates defined contribution plans for qualifying employees in a number of its countries of
operation. The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the Group under the control of
unrelated parties.

The total expense recognised in the period in respect of defined contribution schemes was e 2.4 million
(2012: e 3.8 million, 2011: e 4.1 million). The expense represents contributions payable to the plans at
the rates specified in the plans.

Included in the Group’s current liabilities at the end of the year is an amount of e 23’000 (2012: e 44’000,
2011: e 127’000) representing contributions due in respect of the reporting period but not yet paid over
to the plans.

**Defined benefit plans**

The Group also offers defined benefit plans in certain countries of operation. Under the plans the
employees are entitled to retirement benefits equal to a percentage of their accumulated savings in the
plan on reaching a locally defined retirement age.

The amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in respect of defined benefit
plans are as follows:

Management estimates the expected returns according to historical trends and analysts’ predictions of
the market for the asset in the next twelve months.

The actual return on plan assets was e 8.8 million (2012: e 14.5 million, 2011: e �1.8 million).

The funded pension plan assets are invested in accordance with local laws. They include neither the
Group’s own financial instrument nor property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.

**29. Financial risk management**

Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Board of Directors
has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s financial policies. Group’s
management reports on a monthly basis to the Board of Directors on the Group’s performance. The
Board of Directors meets approximately 8-10 times a year and meeting minutes are documented. The
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for setting financial strategies, which are executed by Group
Treasury and by the Group’s subsidiaries. The activities of Group Treasury and of the various
subsidiaries are regularly reviewed and monitored by the CFO thus verifying the compliance of
operations within the approved guidelines and limits.

The Group Treasury function, in conjunction with the Group Finance Function, monitors the financial
risks relating to the operations of the Group through regular review of the Group’s performance. In
addition covenant compliance, both actual and future based on Group plans, budgets and forecasts, is
reviewed regularly in conjunction with the Group’s key management. To this end, scenario analyses are

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**29. Financial risk management (continued)**

performed to determine the level of risk and to ensure that appropriate procedures are implemented to
manage and mitigate those risks.

The Group Treasury function is responsible for ensuring adequate funds are available to the Group’s
subsidiaries as necessary. To this end a cash pool has been established in respect of some countries in
which the Group operates, and funds are reallocated across the Group as necessary. The Group’s
Treasury function is also responsible for drawing on and repaying amounts under the Group’s capital
expenditure and revolving credit facilities to meet the cash needs of the Group. All drawings must be
approved by the CFO and the outstanding borrowings under each facility are reported to the Board of
Directors on a monthly basis.

The Group has previously used derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates,
as described below in note 29.5, although no such instruments are in place today. The Group constantly
reviews the cost and benefit of entering into such instruments, given also current interest rates and
market expectations of future rates. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments for
speculative purposes.

**29.1. Market risk management**

Financial market risk is essentially caused by exposures to foreign currencies, interest rates and coffee
price. For further details on interest rate risk management see section 29.5 and foreign currency risk
management see section 29.6

The Group is also exposed to commodity price risk because of coffee price fluctuations. Some of these
fluctuations can be passed on to clients through price increases in line with contractual conditions. The
Group has periodically assessed the economic impact of hedging the coffee prices but considers the
hedging-cost as too high to make hedging a commercially attractive measure. However whilst the Group
does not enter into hedging instruments into coffee prices, coffee volumes are committed with suppliers
between 1 and 6 months in advance depending on current green bean coffee prices and expectations of
future price development.

**29.2. Credit risk management**

Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations as prescribed, resulting in a
financial loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk on its trade receivables, its non-current
other financial assets and its cash and cash equivalents.

The carrying amount of financial assets represent the maximum credit exposure. The maximum
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows:

**Total exposure to credit risk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **156’028** **129’869** **121’205**

Trade receivables are subject to credit limits and ongoing credit evaluation in all the subsidiaries. Due to
its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material
concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables, and there were no counterparties where credit risk
exceeded 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. In addition, due to the nature of the
Group’s operations, a significant portion of its revenues are received in cash.

For details on how the Group manages its credit risk arising from trade receivables see note 16.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**29. Financial risk management (continued)**

The Group is not exposed to significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents as these are spread
over several institutions in different geographic areas.

Settlement risk results from the fact that the Group may not receive financial instruments from its
counterparties at the expected time. This risk is managed by monitoring counterparty activity and
settlement limits.

**29.3. Liquidity risk management**

Liquidity risk arises when a company encounters difficulties to meet commitments associated with
financial instruments. Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing
problems. This risk is managed by limiting exposures in instruments that may be affected by liquidity
problems and by actively matching the funding horizon of debt with incoming cash flows. The Group
manages liquidity risk by ensuring adequate reserves are available, and through its banking facilities, in
particular the Group’s capital expenditure and revolving credit facilities. In addition, the Group
continuously monitors cash flows to ensure that adequate funds exist to settle its liabilities.

The Group has several benchmarks and approval requirements for borrowing and investing as well as
for using derivative financial instruments. In general, subsidiaries may not borrow in their respective local
currency without the approval of the CFO. The subsidiaries may also not hedge their foreign currency
exposures without the approval of the CFO. Wherever possible, the Group requires that subsidiaries
repatriate all their excess cash and bank balances to Group finance companies to allow the Group to
ensure that adequate funds are made available across the Group as necessary.

**Liquidity available through financing facilities**

The Senior Facility Agreement also includes a multicurrency revolving credit facility of GBP 25 million
and a GBP 55 million capital expenditure facility to finance acquisitions and other capital expenditures,
(see note 19).

The revolving credit facility expires in July 2014, however the Group has not used this facility since May
2012 and the current budget for the next year does not foresee a need to make any draw down.

The capital expenditure facility can no longer be drawn down against. The Group has been repaying this
facility as required by the Senior Facilities Agreement. The final repayment will be made in July 2014,
after which this facility will terminate.

**29.4. Capital management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as disclosed in note 19 offset by cash
and bank balances) and equity of the Group (comprising share capital, additional paid in capital,
reserves and retained earnings).

The term loan becomes due for repayment on 2 July 2015, and therefore the Board will be reviewing the
capital structure of the Group in the coming months, taking into consideration a potential refinancing of
the debt and the optimal capital structure of the Group in the future.

**29.5. Interest rate risk management**

Interest rate risk comprises the cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates. The Group
analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Various scenarios are simulated taking into
consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. Depending
on management’s assessment of the risks and the associated cost of hedging, these risks are from time
to time mitigated by the use of derivative financial instruments (see note 2.5 Significant accounting
policies and valuation methods).

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk predominately in CHF, EUR, SEK and GBP as a result of its
borrowings.

**30 September 2013**

**29. Financial risk management (continued)**

In order to minimise this risk, Selecta had previously entered into swap and cap agreements. These
instruments swapped floating interest payable on certain of the borrowings into fixed interest rates. The
interest rate was fixed for 65% of the interest payable on the term loans and an interest rate cap existed
on 35% of the interest payable on the term loans until 30 June 2012. All of these interest rate swaps and
caps expired on 30 June 2012 and no further swaps or caps have been entered into. As a result, interest
payable on the term loans is at variable rates as of 30 June 2012 and there are no outstanding interest
rate swaps or caps as at 30 September 2013. The current interest rates are disclosed in note 19.

The weighted average interest rate on the Group’s borrowings amounts to 3.0% above base rate. The
remaining contractual maturity in respect of the Group’s borrowings is disclosed in Note 29.3.

The tables below shows the maturity date, notional principal amounts, fair value, hedged rates and the
interest settlement period of each of the interest rate swaps outstanding, as well as the percentage of
interest payment in respect of the term loans which are hedged.

**Total . . . . . .** **(16’495)**

**Interest rate risk sensitivity**

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the interest rate exposure as at the end of
the reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, being predominately the Group’s borrowings, the
analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period
was outstanding for the whole year, including the revolving and capital expenditure facilities available to
the Group, the outstanding amount of which may vary as the Group draws down on the facilities and
makes repayments.

As noted above, at 30 June 2012 the hedges have expired and therefore the portion of the Group’s term
loans which are hedged has reduced from 65.1% to zero.

At 30 September 2013, if interest rates had been 1 percent higher/lower, with all other assumptions held
constant, profit after taxation would decrease/increase by e 8.2 million (e 8.5 million respectively in
financial year ended 30 September 2012 and e 3.5 million in financial year ended 30 September 2011).
The increased sensitivity to interest rate changes is caused by the lower level of debt at 30 September
2013.

A 1 percent change is used for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis as it represents management’s
assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.

**29.6. Foreign currency risk management**

Foreign currency transaction risk arises because subsidiaries sometimes undertake transactions in
foreign currencies such as the import of machines and the acquisition of services and the related
borrowings. Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the Group accounts into e and is not
hedged but managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.

In order to minimise the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk, the borrowings and related interest
payments have been established in the four main currencies in which the Group operates, namely EUR,

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)**

**30 September 2013**

**29. Financial risk management (continued)**

CHF, GBP and SEK. In this way a natural hedge exists to a significant extent between the Group’s income
(being the operating profits of the subsidiaries), and its major expenses (being the interest payable on
the borrowings).

**Exposure to currency risk**

Since each of the Group’s subsidiaries invoices its customers in the functional currency in which that
subsidiary operated, and since the significant part of its cost base is also denominated in its functional
currency, the exposure to currency risk within the trading subsidiaries of the Group is not significant.

Certain of the holding companies based in Switzerland, and therefore with Swiss Francs as their
functional currency, have loan receivables and payables, both with external parties and with other Group
companies, denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. The table below shows the
total net assets / (liabilities) which are exposed to currency risk, by currency, arising in those entities:

**Foreign currency sensitivity**

Most Group companies transact the majority of their business in their local currency. For Selecta Group,
transaction risks arise as a result of financing based on another currency than Group functional
currency. The transaction risks analysis has been performed to include variations in the exchange rate
between CHF, GBP and SEK against EUR as those three currencies represent major currencies other
than Group’s functional currency in which the Group’s borrowings were received. The Group’s
sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the Group’s net transaction exposure as at the end of
the reporting period. A �10 percent change is used for the purposes of the sensitivity analysis as it
represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.

At 30 September 2013 a �10 percent change in the CHF, GBP and SEK against EUR would impact the
net profit of the Group according to the table below. The amounts below show the increase in net profit
which would come about as a result of a 10% strengthening of the EUR against each of the currencies
below. For a 10% weakening of the EUR against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable
decrease in net profit.

**29.7. Accounting policies**

The Group manages its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set
out in note 2.6.

**30. Financial instruments**

**Derivative Financial Instruments**

The Group uses from time to time interest rate swaps and caps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate
borrowings. The effect of the hedging activities is disclosed in notes 8 and 19. The fair values of the
interest rate swaps are disclosed above in note 29.5. As at 30 September 2013 the Group has no
outstanding interest rate swaps or caps.

**Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position**

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial
recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is
observable.

- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly
(i.e. derived from prices).

- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for
the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

non-cancellable operating leases relate to a building lease contracts held by the holding and trading
company Selecta AG in Switzerland. The most significant lease contracts have been signed for a period
between 15 and 20 years.

**32. Contingent liabilities and contingent assets**

The Group, through a number of its subsidiaries, is involved in various legal proceedings or claims
arising from its normal business. Provisions are made as appropriate where management assesses that
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will arise. None of these proceedings results in a
material contingent liability for the Group.

**33. Pledged assets**

In order to secure the Group’s borrowings, Selecta Group B.V. has pledged its shares in Selecta AG as
security in favour of the lenders. As Selecta AG owns, directly or indirectly, all of the other subsidiaries of
the Group listed in note 27, and as the only material asset on Selecta Group B.V.’s own balance sheet is
cash at bank which is subject to a separate pledge as security in favour of the lenders, in effect all of the
assets of the Group are pledged as security. The Group is not allowed to pledge these assets as security
for other borrowings, except in the limited circumstances as stated in the senior and mezzanine facility
agreements.

**34. Related party transactions**

**Parent undertaking**

The immediate parent of the Group is ACP Verm¨ogensverwaltung GmbH & Co. KG Nr. 4 d, a company
incorporated in Munich (Germany).

The ultimate controlling party of the Group is Allianz SE, incorporated in Germany.

**Intra group transactions**

Transactions between the parent company and its subsidiaries, and between subsidiaries, have been
eliminated on consolidation.

**Key management personnel**

The Board of Directors of the Group through the date of these Financial Statements and up to the date of
approval comprised:

The value of the net assets disposed of as reported in the year ended 30 September 2012 included
provisions for certain contingent liabilities which the Group expected to incur. In fact the amounts
incurred in respect of these liabilities was lower, and hence an additional disposal gain of e 202’000 was
recognised in the year ended 30 September 2013.

**36. Segment information**

The Group wide operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors (as the Group’s chief
operating decision maker) to assess performance and to determine how resources should be
distributed. Therefore the Group has a single reportable segment which reflects the management
structure implemented within the Selecta Group.

The geographic information below presents revenue and non-current assets (excluding financial assets
and deferred income tax assets) by the country of domicile for the largest countries in the Group for the
