**transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the notes and any associated securities at a**
**level higher than that which might otherwise prevail for a limited period after the issue date.**

**stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time, and must be brought to an end after a**
**limited period.**

**INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

The following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made in this offering
memorandum. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future
events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often,
but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as ‘‘will likely result,’’ ‘‘are expected
to,’’ ‘‘will continue,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘is anticipated,’’ ‘‘estimated,’’ ‘‘intends,’’ ‘‘expects,’’ ‘‘plans,’’ ‘‘seek,’’
‘‘projection’’ and ‘‘outlook.’’ These statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties which
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. Any forward-looking statements are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this offering memorandum.
Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on our results of operations are:

   - risks associated with our high leverage and debt service obligations;

   - the impact of restrictive debt covenants on our operating flexibility;

  - uncertainties associated with general economic conditions in the Netherlands and across Europe;

   - factors affecting our ability to compete in a competitive market;

   - uncertainties associated with our ability to implement our business strategy;

  - uncertainties associated with the restructuring of our Vroom & Dreesmann business unit;

  - uncertainties associated with changing customer preferences and demands;

   - risks relating to the seasonal nature of our business;

   - risks relating to unseasonal weather conditions;

   - risks relating to our real estate property;

   - risks relating to our ability to recruit and retain senior management and personnel;

   - risks relating to sourcing products from foreign markets;

  - the impact of shop crime and fraud;

   - uncertainties associated with our reliance on, and our ability to upgrade and maintain, our
information technology systems;

   - risks relating to the evolution of the funding coverage ratio of our pension funds and the
applicable accounting standards;

   - risks relating to our ability to maintain the reputation of, and value associated with, our brand
names;

   - risks relating to conflicting interests of our principal shareholders and holders of the notes; and

   - other risks and uncertainties inherent to our business.

iv


-----

These and other factors are discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

Because the risk factors referred to in this offering memorandum could cause actual results or
outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this
offering memorandum by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any of these
forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which
it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or
circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events. New factors will emerge in the future, and it is not possible for us to predict
which factors they will be. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or
the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those described in any forward-looking statements.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

Information relating to markets, market size, market share, market position, growth rates,
penetration rates, average prices and other industry data pertaining to our business contained in this
offering memorandum consists of estimates based on data reports compiled by professional
organizations and analysts, on data from external sources, on our knowledge of our sales and markets
and on our own calculations based on such information. In many cases, there is no readily available
external information (whether from trade associations, government bodies or other organizations) to
validate market-related analyses and estimates, thus requiring us to rely on internally developed
estimates. While we have compiled, extracted and reproduced market or other industry data from
external sources, including third party or industry or general publications, neither we nor the initial
purchasers have independently verified the data. We cannot assure you of the accuracy and
completeness of, and take no responsibility for, such data. Similarly, while we believe our internal
estimates to be reasonable, they have not been verified by any independent sources, and we cannot
assure you as to their accuracy.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

Unless otherwise indicated, references in this offering memorandum to ‘‘euro’’ or ‘‘A’’ are to the
single currency of the participating Member States in the Third Stage of European Economic and
Monetary Union pursuant to the Treaty Establishing the European Community, as amended from time
to time; references to ‘‘dollars,’’ ‘‘US$’’ or ‘‘$’’ are to the lawful currency of the United States of
America; and references to ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us,’’ ‘‘our,’’ or similar terms are, prior to the acquisition of Vendex
KBB, to Vendex KBB and its consolidated subsidiaries, and, thereafter, to Victoria Acquisition III B.V.
and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Vendex KBB and its subsidiaries, except where the context
otherwise requires.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, all Dutch
Guilder (‘‘NLG’’) amounts have been translated into euro at an exchange rate of A1.00=NLG 2.20371.

The consolidated financial statements of the issuer and Vendex KBB contained in this offering
memorandum are derived from the financial statements that were prepared for Dutch legal and
statutory purposes in accordance with the law governing the preparation of financial statements in the
Netherlands. There are significant differences between Dutch generally accepted accounting principles
(‘‘Dutch GAAP’’) and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’). For more information,
see ‘‘Annex A—Summary of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS.’’

In accordance with Dutch GAAP, we have classified certain Dutch Hybrid Instruments issued by us
as a form of equity. Under IFRS, however, these instruments would be likely to be treated as a
liability, and, for certain purposes under the indenture governing the notes (the ‘‘Indenture’’) these

v


-----

instruments will be considered as indebtedness. However, given their current treatment under Dutch
GAAP, we have described the Dutch Hybrid Instruments as a form of equity throughout this Offering
Memorandum. See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Dutch Hybrid Instruments,’’ ‘‘Description of
the Notes’’ and ‘‘Annex A-Summary of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS.’’

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with
SEC reporting requirements. Compliance with such requirements would require the presentation of
financial information prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States (‘‘US GAAP’’) and the modification or exclusion of certain financial measures, including
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein).

Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period that ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of
each year. Half-year figures represent the period from the end of the prior fiscal year to the Sunday
closest to July 31st of the relevant year. Accordingly, references herein to:

   - ‘‘Fiscal 2005’’ are to the 52-week period ending January 29, 2006;

   - ‘‘Fiscal 2004’’ are to the 52-week period ending January 30, 2005;

   - ‘‘Fiscal 2003’’ are to the 52-week period ending February 1, 2004;

   - ‘‘Fiscal 2002’’ are to the 52-week period ending February 2, 2003;

   - ‘‘Fiscal 2001’’ are to the 53-week period ending February 3, 2002;

   - ‘‘Fiscal 2000’’ are to the 52-week period ending January 28, 2001;

   - ‘‘Half Year 2004’’ are to the 26-week period ending August 1, 2004;

  - ‘‘Half Year 2003’’ are to the 26-week period ending August 3, 2003; and

  - ‘‘Last 12 Months’’ and ‘‘LTM’’ are to the 52-week period ending August 1, 2004.

**Continued Activities and Discontinued Activities**

Our financial reporting highlights the performance over time of those businesses which we
continue to operate. Accordingly, items reported as being for ‘‘continued activities’’ in all fiscal periods
reflect the performance only of the activities that we continue to engage in at present. As such, for all
fiscal periods ‘‘continued activities’’ refers to our DIY, HEMA, Apparel, Bijenkorf, Vroom &
Dreesmann (‘‘V&D’’) and Consumer Electronics business units, our property companies and our other
activities (in each case as described herein). Accordingly, in any fiscal period, ‘‘discontinued activities’’
are those businesses which we owned during (at least part of) that period but which we no longer own.

**Certain Terms Used to Describe Our Retail Operations**

In describing our company and our business, we use certain terms customary to the retail sector.
Accordingly, the following defined terms are used:

   - ‘‘SKU’’ is a stock keeping unit, which is the basic measure of unique retail products. Multiple
pieces of merchandise represent a single SKU if they are the same in all material aspects, such
as model, size and color;

   - ‘‘FTE’’ or ‘‘full time equivalent’’ is an expression of the size of a workforce measured as the
total number of paid working hours for that workforce divided by the number of working hours
for a standard full time employee during the same period; and

   - ‘‘m[2]’’ refers to square meters.

**Our Group**

We are the leading non-food retailer in the Netherlands with an estimated 8% overall market
share and with expanding operations in Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain.
We were created in 1999 through the merger of two of the oldest and largest retail groups in the
Netherlands, Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB, which were
founded respectively in 1887 and 1870. We are organized into six main business units: DIY; HEMA
(variety store); Apparel; Bijenkorf and V&D (both department stores); and Consumer Electronics. In
addition, we also operate a number of smaller retail-related and service businesses. Our business units
comprise a total of 15 retail formats, which we believe represents a diversified portfolio of
well-established brands, many of which are household names in the Netherlands.

We operate 1,785 stores, both directly and through franchises, representing approximately two
million square meters of net retail space. We estimate that, in the Netherlands alone, our retail formats
collectively receive an average of eight million visitors per week.

**Description of Principal Business Units**

   - DIY. Our DIY business unit is the leading player in the do-it-yourself market in the Benelux,
with a clear leadership position in the consolidating Belgian market and a strong number two
position in the Netherlands. Our DIY business unit operates four complementary retail formats
(Praxis and Formido in the Netherlands and Brico and Brico Plan-It in Belgium) which together
combine larger and smaller size and directly operated and franchise stores, selling an extensive
range of home improvement products, decorative items, tools and appliances, principally to retail
customers.

  - HEMA. HEMA is a unique general merchandise retailer offering a wide range of attractively
designed, good value, everyday household items, under the HEMA brand name. This range of
products consists of items regularly used in typical households: cosmetics, basic apparel (baby
clothes, underwear and general apparel), hard goods (household goods, linen and office
supplies) and food (including baked goods, meats, confectionery and wine). HEMA is a Dutch
institution, enjoying an excellent brand image and a market leadership in a number of
categories. HEMA operates stores in the Netherlands, Belgium and, on a pilot basis, in
Germany.

   - Apparel. Our Apparel business unit is our most international unit, operating in seven countries,
and consists of three retail formats: M&S, Hunkem¨oller and Claudia Str¨ater. Our three formats
offer private label women’s apparel that is carefully designed to appeal to particular segments of
the market. M&S is our largest apparel format and is positioned as a discount boutique for
women over 35. Hunkem¨oller is the leading lingerie, swimwear and nightwear retailer in the
Benelux, and Claudia Str¨ater is a niche player in the up-market, professional and casual
women’s apparel market.

   - Bijenkorf. Bijenkorf is the only national up-market department store chain in the Netherlands.
Bijenkorf offers a wide variety of up-market products, including apparel, cosmetics, accessories,
household goods, leisure goods and fine foods, with international premium brands and A-brands
as well as private label brands.

  - V&D. V&D is the only national middle-market department store chain in the Netherlands. V&D
offers a wide variety of products in several categories, including apparel, lifestyle and home
entertainment, mostly under its own labels. Most V&D stores also include well-known and
popular restaurants operating under the name La Place, and bakery departments operating
under the name Le March´e.

   - Consumer Electronics. Our Consumer Electronics business unit operates five retail formats
(Dixons, Dynabyte, It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper) that cover most segments of the
consumer electronics market: multimedia, computer, digital photography, household electronics
and brown and white goods. We believe that we are among the leading consumer electronics
retailers in the Netherlands. We are currently in discussions with interested parties with respect
to the sale of all or part of the Consumer Electronics business unit, which may or may not lead
to an agreement.

**Our Strengths**

**_Leading Market Position in Attractive and Stable Markets_**

We are the leading non-food retailer in the Netherlands. We estimate our overall market share of
the highly fragmented Dutch non-food retail market at 8%. We are the leading player in the do-ityourself market in the Benelux, being the market leader in Belgium (with an estimated market share of
20%) and having a strong number two position in the Netherlands (with an estimated market share of
24%). Our HEMA store chain is the largest general merchandiser in the Netherlands, and our

2


-----

Bijenkorf and V&D department store retail formats are the only national department store chains
operating in the Dutch market. Our Apparel formats have strong, well differentiated positions in their
respective niche markets, and, including Bijenkorf and V&D, we are, as a group, the largest apparel
retailer in the Netherlands. We believe our Consumer Electronics business unit is among the leading
consumer electronics retailers in the Netherlands.

Our size enables us to negotiate prices from our suppliers that are lower than those offered to our
local competitors, facilitates the negotiation of better rental terms, improves our access to prime real
estate locations and gives us the scale necessary to realize cost efficiencies in marketing and central
administration.

In addition, we believe that the non-food retail market is relatively more stable in the Netherlands
than in many other countries due to regulatory restrictions on out-of-town building developments, space
limitations, and a customer preference for city center shopping. We believe that the stability of the
market structure has historically favored existing non-food retailers, such as ourselves, over new
entrants.

**_Highly Recognized Brand Names and Well Established Franchises_**

We believe that our brands are well established in the Netherlands and benefit from strong market
positions with many years of continuous operations. Bijenkorf and V&D have been active department
store chains for over 100 years, HEMA has operated in the Netherlands for more than 75 years, and
Hunkem¨oller for more than 120 years. Today, our portfolio includes some of the most popular brands
in the Netherlands. For example, HEMA was elected the best retail store in the Netherlands in 2003
(Elsevier Retail Survey) for the second consecutive year and Hunkem¨oller won the Mastercard Retailer
of the Year award in 2003. We believe that the established franchises and nearly universal recognition
in the Netherlands of our various brand names help to drive a high foot traffic in our stores and
represent a significant competitive advantage.

**_Large Store Portfolio in Prime Locations_**

We operate directly or through franchises a portfolio of 1,785 stores in the Netherlands (1,168),
Belgium (289), France (153), Germany (137), Denmark (19), Luxembourg (10) and Spain (9),
representing a net selling space of approximately two million square meters. Our store portfolio is
unique in the Netherlands, as a significant portion of our stores are located in prime retail locations, in
town centers, along high streets and in major shopping districts. This results in very high foot traffic in
our stores. We estimate that in the Netherlands, which has a population of 16.3 million, we receive
approximately 8 million visitors per week. We believe that the quality and size of our store portfolio
represent a significant competitive advantage, given the limited availability of high quality retail
locations in the Netherlands. In addition, we believe that our size and the fact that HEMA, Bijenkorf
and V&D often serve as anchor tenants in their respective locations make us an attractive tenant to
landlords and provide substantial leverage in negotiating and securing current and future rental
agreements.

**_Diversified Business Portfolio_**

We are organized into six main business units and operate across three retail categories through a
total of 15 retail formats. Our portfolio of retail formats offers customers a diversified range of
products and brands that appeal to a broad spectrum of consumer market segments. We sell products
that range from do-it-yourself to apparel to electronics and include both branded and private label
products. Our 15 different retail formats target consumers in the value, middle-market and up-market
segments. For example, HEMA’s products typically appeal to value conscious consumers, while V&D
and Bijenkorf primarily target the middle-market and up-market customers, respectively. While still

3


-----

geographically concentrated in the Netherlands, we have an increasing presence outside the
Netherlands (with 18% of our turnover generated outside the Netherlands in Fiscal 2003). We believe
that the diversity of our business portfolio across different market segments and customer spending
categories reduces the sensitivity of our business to economic downturns and our exposure to adverse
developments in any single product or consumer market segment.

**_Stable Margins and Cash Flows in our Most Significant Business Units and Adjustable Capital Expenditures_**

We benefit from relatively stable cash flows, due mainly to consistent EBITDA generation in our
most significant business units and predictable and adjustable capital expenditure throughout the group.
Despite the recent economic downturn in the Netherlands, one of the most significant in the last
20 years, DIY and HEMA, our two largest EBITDA generators, maintained relatively stable margins.

We have invested A616 million in our business over the past three years which represents 147% of
our depreciation charges during that same period. A large part of our capital expenditures represents
discretionary investments in store refurbishments, expansions and openings, that we are therefore able
to defer, if necessary, to provide greater financial flexibility through the economic cycle.

**_Experienced and Incentivized Management Team_**

Our Board of Management and the head of each business unit have an average of 21 years of
experience in retail. We believe that the depth of experience of our operational management teams,
gained across different retail segments, provides us with an advantage over smaller competitors,
allowing us to exchange knowledge of best practices and deploy members of our operational
management teams across business units. Our Board of Management, together with approximately 50
other managers, have made a significant equity investment in the group, and have been granted an
incentive package with a strong focus on increasing profitability and cash generation.

**_Principal Shareholders with Significant Retail Sector Experience_**

We expect to benefit from the relationships, investment experience, retail expertise and Dutch
market knowledge of our sponsors, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (‘‘KKR’’), Cinven Limited
(‘‘Cinven’’), Permira Advisers Limited (and other entities which act as advisers or consultants to
Permira funds, ‘‘Permira’’) and AlpInvest Partners N.V. (‘‘AlpInvest’’ and together with KKR, Cinven
and Permira, the ‘‘Sponsors’’).

Our Sponsors are some of the world’s leading and most experienced private equity firms and have
a significant track record of successful investments in the retail industry. Our Sponsors’ investments in
the retail industry have included Safeway, Stop & Shop, Fred Meyer, Randall’s Food Markets, Peacock
and Allied Carpets.

**Our Strategy**

The following identifies some of the key elements of our strategy.

**_Improve Operations within the Group_**

Under new ownership, our key priority is to improve the performance of all our business units in
order to increase our profitability and to improve our cash flow generation.

To achieve this goal, each of our DIY, HEMA, Apparel, Bijenkorf and V&D business units, with
the support of specialized consultants, has conducted over the last three months a comprehensive
review of their operations, including for each of their formats an assessment of each significant cost
and working capital component. As a result of this review, we have identified across these business

4


-----

units significant cost savings opportunities and working capital improvements that we expect to be able
to achieve over the next three years.

We have identified cost savings opportunities that may be realized through (i) the optimization of
our head-office functions both in our business units and at corporate level, (ii) the improvement of
efficiency in our stores, (iii) productivity gains in our logistics and back office operations through the
optimization of our warehouse facilities (particularly in Bijenkorf and Apparel) and additional
investments in IT and automation, and (iv) an improvement in our purchasing costs, in particular
through a reduction in the number of suppliers of DIY, Bijenkorf and V&D and an increase in the
share of our Far East sourcing (in particular related to apparel and do-it-yourself products). We expect
that some of these cost savings could be achieved in the near term, and we believe that the
reorganization of V&D has demonstrated our ability to achieve cost savings rapidly and on a significant
scale, with approximately A50 million cost savings on an annualized basis achieved six months after
announcement.

The management of working capital has not previously been a key priority of our business units,
and we believe that significant cash-generating opportunities exist through renegotiating payment terms
with our suppliers across all of our business units and through improving our inventory management
through investment in automation and IT. Some of our business units have significantly shorter
payment terms than comparable businesses operating in similar markets, and we expect to be able to
improve payment terms with many of our suppliers in the near term. While the implementation of
logistics automation or up-to-date retail software can take time, we believe that the successful
mechanization of the HEMA distribution center in 2003 has illustrated our ability to implement such
measures and to generate the expected inventory reductions successfully and on a timely basis.

**_Continue the Integration and Selective Expansion of our DIY Formats_**

Our DIY formats in the Netherlands and Belgium have historically operated as separate businesses
with little coordination. We believe that significant opportunities exist to increase profitability and to
reduce working capital by coordinating purchasing across these formats as well as by sharing resources
and exchanging best practices between them.

In parallel to the implementation of these measures, we will continue to selectively expand our
successful medium-size Brico store concept and large-size Brico Plan-It store concept in Belgium
through further conversions and store openings, and thereby drive our like-for-like sales growth and
reinforce our market position in the country. We may also pursue selected store-opening opportunities
in the Dutch market.

**_Continue to Implement the V&D Restructuring Plan_**

The management team led by Mr. Dirk Goeminne, which successfully turned around HEMA in
1998, has developed and started the implementation of a comprehensive restructuring plan aimed at
restoring the profitability of V&D by (i) cutting cost and (ii) improving gross margin and
re-invigorating like-for-like sales. The first measures of this plan, including a reduction of 1,800 FTEs
and the closing of 12 department stores, have already been successfully completed and have resulted in
annualized cost savings of approximately A50 million and an improvement in V&D’s performance
despite a decline in sales. With the business now stabilized, we are focused on improving gross margin
and re-invigorating V&D’s like-for-like sales growth through a renewal of styling, product offering,
advertising, branding and the introduction of a new store concept.

**_Grow our Business through Selective Initiatives and Disciplined Expansion_**

In addition to the strategies discussed above, we have taken specific initiatives to drive the like-forlike sales growth in our formats, including in particular, adjusting the M&S product offering in line

5


-----

with its target customer group in the Netherlands, and optimizing our product offering at HEMA (new
fresh food offering and improved children and hardware product lines), and we intend to identify and
pursue similar initiatives going forward.

We also intend to selectively expand our store portfolio to consolidate our market position in the
Netherlands and pursue the international expansion of the retail formats that have demonstrated the
ability to grow successfully in other European countries. In addition to the DIY opportunities discussed
above, we have identified the opening of HEMA stores in the Netherlands (in smaller catchment areas)
and Belgium (to continue HEMA’s successful expansion in this country) and the international
expansion of M&S (in France and Southern Europe) and Hunkem¨oller (mostly in Denmark, France
and Southern Europe) as the most attractive opportunities.

All investment decisions are based on stringent return on capital requirements and we have
adopted a conservative and disciplined approach to our international expansion, starting with extensive
market research, followed by deployment of pilot stores and opening of new stores, if appropriate.

**_Review Strategic Alternatives for Consumer Electronics_**

We are currently in discussions with interested parties with respect to the sale of all or part of the
Consumer Electronics business unit, which may or may not lead to an agreement.

**_Focus on De-leveraging_**

One of our key priorities is to reduce our debt levels. To do so, we will aim to maximize the cash
flows available for debt reduction through the implementation of initiatives to improve operating
efficiencies and a continued focus on the management of our working capital.

**The Acquisition**

On April 26, 2004, Vendex KBB and VDXK, an acquisition vehicle controlled by investment funds
advised by KKR and AlpInvest, announced the key terms of a recommended cash offer for all the
outstanding share capital of Vendex KBB (the ‘‘Tender Offer’’). On August 3, 2004, after the closing of
the Tender Offer and the subsequent post-acceptance period, Vendex KBB was delisted from Euronext
Amsterdam and VDXK owned 99.56% of its total outstanding share capital. The Tender Offer, the
refinancing or retention of the existing indebtedness of Vendex KBB, and the payment of fees and
expenses associated therewith (the ‘‘Acquisition’’) amounted to approximately A2.5 billion. The funding
of the Acquisition consisted of:

   - A970 million of equity and equity related financing;

   - A550 million of senior term loans (the ‘‘Term Loans’’) and a revolving credit facility (the
‘‘Revolving Credit Facility’’ and together with the Term Loans, the ‘‘Senior Credit Facilities’’);

   - a A600 million property facility (the ‘‘Mortgage Loan’’);

   - a A350 million subordinated bridge facility (the ‘‘Bridge Facility’’); and

  - A55 million of existing indebtedness of Vendex KBB that was retained.

On August 5, 2004, investment funds advised by KKR syndicated part of their indirect equity
interest in VDXK to investment funds advised by Cinven and investment funds advised by Permira. See
‘‘Principal Shareholders.’’

On or about September 30, 2004, the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans was increased
by A75 million to A625 million and the aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Facility was reduced
by A75 million to A275 million. See ‘‘—The Refinancing.’’

-----

**The Property Transaction**

Our Propcos own 71 stores (59 HEMA stores, seven V&D stores and five Bijenkorf stores) and
three parking lots and receive rental payments from our HEMA, Bijenkorf and V&D business units,
that are expected to amount to A65 million for Fiscal 2004.

As part of the financing of the Acquisition, our Propcos have borrowed A600 million under the
Mortgage Loan on a limited recourse basis, which is expected to be serviced by the rental payments
from our HEMA, Bijenkorf and V&D business units. Our Propcos are ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’
under the terms of the Indenture and are not subject to the restrictive covenants of the Indenture. We
refer to the transactions associated with the Mortgage Loan and the rental payments from our
operating business units to our Propcos as described in ‘‘The Acquisition, the Property Transaction and
Related Transactions—The Property Transaction’’ as the ‘‘Property Transaction.’’

**The Refinancing**

On or about September 30, 2004, we have amended the Senior Credit Facilities to increase the
aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans by A75 million to A625 million. The proceeds from this
A75 million increase of the Term Loans were used to reduce the aggregate principal outstanding
amount under the Bridge Loan from A350 million to A275 million.

The proceeds of this offering will be used to repay the remaining A275 million aggregate principal
amount under the Bridge Facility. We refer to the increase of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Credit Facilities and the offering and sale of the notes to repay the Bridge Loan as the
‘‘Refinancing.’’ See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

**The Issuer**

The issuer, Victoria Acquisition III B.V., is a private limited liability company established under
the laws of the Netherlands on April 26, 2004. The issuer conducted no operations or other activities
prior to the Acquisition.

**Our Principal Shareholders**

Our principal shareholders are a group of investment funds (the ‘‘Consortium’’) advised by KKR,
Cinven, Permira and AlpInvest.

KKR is one of the world’s leading and most experienced private equity firms and has a strong
track record and expertise in the retail sector. Since its foundation in 1976, KKR has invested in excess
of $18 billion in more than 115 transactions, that have represented approximately $118 billion of total
financing. KKR is active in Europe through its affiliate’s London office as well as in the United States.
KKR has invested in transactions representing more than $11 billion in the retail sector, including the
acquisitions of Safeway, Stop & Shop, Fred Meyer, Randall’s Food Markets, AutoZone and Shoppers
Drug Mart.

Cinven is one of Europe’s leading private equity firms and has a strong track record in both
European non-food retail and the large buyout market in the Netherlands. Established in 1977, Cinven
has invested in excess of A7.5 billion in transactions requiring total financing of approximately
A40 billion. Cinven operates throughout Europe from its offices in Frankfurt, London and Paris. Retail
investments led by Cinven include Peacock, Hoogenbosch and Allied Carpets. Large buyouts led by
Cinven in the Netherlands include Nutreco, Kappa Packaging and Kluwer Academic Publishing (now
renamed Springer).

Permira is one of Europe’s leading private equity firms, advising funds totalling approximately
A11 billion, including Permira Europe III, a A5.1 billion fund raised in 2003. Permira is an independent

7


-----

business with offices in London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Stockholm and New York focussing
on European buyout transactions across a number of sectors, including consumer, technology, business
services, chemicals, industrial products and services and healthcare. Since 1985, funds advised by
Permira have invested in more than 260 transactions in 15 different countries.

AlpInvest (formerly NIB Capital) is one of the largest private equity investors in the world, with
more than A19.9 billion of assets under management. AlpInvest’s funds are managed by approximately
100 employees, of whom 60 are investment professionals from offices in Amsterdam, Antwerp,
Frankfurt and New York. AlpInvest’s shareholders and main investors are ABP and PGGM, two of the
largest pension funds in the world with approximately A150 billion and A53 billion of assets under
management, respectively.

**Recent Developments**

In connection with the evaluation of the possible sale of all or part of our Consumer Electronics
business unit, discussions have been progressing with a number of interested parties. Since July 31,
2004, we have commenced negotiations regarding the sale of our interest in IMpact Retail B.V.
(‘‘IMpact’’), which comprises the retail formats It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper. If a
transaction is concluded at the price forming the basis of the current negotiations, management expects
that, in the accounts of Vendex KBB, the disposal would result in a pre-tax book loss of approximately
A30 million, which management believes is tax deductible, resulting in an estimated book loss on
disposal after tax of A20 million. If no transaction is concluded, management believes it has
opportunities to improve the operating profitability of IMpact. Management did not include an
impairment loss on the accounts of Vendex KBB in respect of IMpact in its Half Year 2004 financial
statements. Had an impairment loss been recorded based on the price forming the basis of the current
negotiations, Vendex KBB would have recorded the following accounting entries on its books: (i) a
reduction in operating result of approximately A30 million, (ii) a reduction in net result of
approximately A20 million and (iii) a reduction in group equity of approximately A20 million. These
accounting entries would not have affected cash flow or adjusted EBITDA amounts for the Half Year
2004 presented elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Pending the outcome of negotiations, including
the preparation and negotiation of definitive documents, management has not made any decision to sell
IMpact at the price forming the basis of the current negotiations, and a transaction may or may not
occur. If a transaction does occur at the price forming the basis of current negotiations, Victoria
Acquisition III B.V., the issuer, would not record any impairment charge in its consolidated profit and
loss accounts since, in connection with its preliminary purchase accounting, the relevant assets were
recorded at their then estimated fair value.

74% of the adjusted EBITDA of Vendex KBB excluding the Propcos. The Guarantors will
guarantee the notes on a senior subordinated basis. The Guarantees are subject to a 179-day
standstill on enforcement in certain circumstances and are also subject to release upon certain
circumstances. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees,’’ ‘‘Description
of the Notes’’ and ‘‘Listing and General Information—Guarantor Information.’’

(6) We have initiated a squeeze-out procedure which is expected to be completed in the next six
months. Subsequently, Vendex KBB is expected to merge into VDXK. While this merger is
expected to take place after the completion of the squeeze-out procedure, under certain
circumstances, the Consortium may cause the merger to occur prior to the completion of the
squeeze-out procedure.

(7) The Revolving Credit Facility consists of up to A265 million available to finance working capital
and other general corporate purposes.

**The Offering**

_The following summary of the offering contains basic information about the notes and the Guarantees._
_It is not intended to be complete and it is subject to important limitations and exceptions. For a more_
_complete understanding of the notes and the Guarantees, including certain definitions of terms used in this_
_summary, please refer to the section of this offering memorandum entitled ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’_

Issuer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Victoria Acquisition III B.V.

Notes offered . . . . . . . . . . . . . . A million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes
due, 2014; and

A million aggregate principal amount of % Senior
Notes due, 2014.

We may issue additional notes in the future, subject to compliance
with the covenants in the Indenture.

Maturity date . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will mature on, 2014.

Interest rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . For the Floating Rate Notes: six-month EURIBOR plus %
per year.

For the Fixed Rate Notes: % per year.

Interest payment dates . . . . . . . The interest on the notes will accrue from the date of issuance and
will be payable semi-annually in arrears on and
of each year, commencing on, 2005.

Use of proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . We intend to use the gross proceeds of the offering of the notes to
make a funding loan to Vendex KBB. Vendex KBB will use the
proceeds of the funding loan to repay the principal amount
outstanding under the Bridge Facility. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

Denominations . . . . . . . . . . . . . Each note will have a minimum denomination of A50,000.

Ranking of the notes . . . . . . . . The notes will be senior obligations of the issuer and will rank
equal in right of payment with each other and all of the issuer’s
existing and future senior debt. The notes will rank senior to any of
the issuer’s existing or future indebtedness that is expressly
subordinated to the notes.

Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the
Guarantors.

As of August 1, 2004 and for the Last 12 Months, the subsidiaries
of Vendex KBB that are Guarantors collectively held approximately
81% of the assets of Vendex KBB excluding the Propcos, generated
approximately 79% of the revenues of Vendex KBB excluding the
Propcos and 74% of the adjusted EBITDA of Vendex KBB
excluding the Propcos. See ‘‘Listing and General Information—
Guarantor Information.’’

The Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances, including
the sale of Vendex KBB or its subsidiaries if certain conditions are
met. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Guarantees.’’

11


-----

Security . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will be secured by a second priority pledge over the
funding loan and a second priority pledge over the shares of VDXK
and Vendex KBB. The security granted in favor of the notes may be
released in certain circumstances, including the sale of Vendex KBB
or its subsidiaries, if certain conditions are met. In the event of a
merger transaction between Vendex KBB and VDXK, the security
over the ownership interest in the merged entities will be released
except for security over the ownership interests in the surviving
entity. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below)
restricts in certain circumstances, the right of the issuer to enforce
and receive payments under the funding loan.

Ranking of the guarantees . . . . . Each Guarantee will be senior subordinated indebtedness of the
relevant Guarantor. Accordingly, the Guarantees will:

             - rank junior in right of payment to each Guarantor’s existing
and future senior indebtedness (including any obligations in
respect of the Senior Credit Facilities);

             - rank pari passu in right of payment with any future senior
subordinated indebtedness of the Guarantors; and

             - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Guarantors.

In addition, each Guarantee will effectively rank junior in right of
payment to its existing and future secured obligations (to the extent
of the value of the collateral securing those obligations) and the
existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including
trade payables) of its non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement provide that the
Guarantors are not permitted to make payments in respect of their
Guarantees if a payment default has occurred and is continuing
under the Senior Credit Facilities or during the continuation of a
payment blockage period. Enforcement actions in respect of the
Guarantees are also subject to a standstill period imposed by the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

As of August 1, 2004, after giving pro forma effect to the
Refinancing, the Guarantors would have had a total of
approximately A680 million of indebtedness to which the
Guarantees would be contractually subordinated.

Optional redemption . . . . . . . . . _Floating Rate Notes._

We may redeem some or all of the Floating Rate Notes at any time
on or after, at the redemption prices described
in ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption—
Redemption—Floating Rate Notes,’’ plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any.

12


-----

In addition, at any time on or prior to, we may
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Floating Rate Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at
a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a
premium equal to the interest rate per annum of the Floating Rate
Note applicable on the date on which the notice of redemption is
given plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, provided that at least 60% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Floating Rate Notes originally issued remains
outstanding immediately after each such redemption.

_Fixed Rate Notes._

We may redeem some or all of the Fixed Rate Notes at any time
on or after, 2008, at the redemption prices described
in ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption,’’ plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any.

In addition, at any time prior to, 2007, we may
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed
Rate Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a
redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a
premium equal to % plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, provided that at least 60% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Fixed Rate Notes remains outstanding immediately
after the redemption.

At any time prior to, 2008, we may redeem all or
part of the Fixed Rate Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes redeemed plus a ‘‘make
whole’’ premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as
described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.’’

Additional amounts; tax
redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . All payments in respect of the notes will be made without
withholding or deduction for any taxes or other governmental
charges, except to the extent required by law. If withholding or
deduction is required by law, subject to certain exceptions, we will
pay additional amounts so that the net amount you receive is no
less than that you would have received in the absence of such
withholding or deduction. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Withholding Taxes.’’

If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction
become effective that would impose withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on any series of the notes or the
Guarantees, we may redeem the notes of that series in whole, but
not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

13


-----

Repurchase at the option of
holders upon a change of
control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we experience a change of control, you will have the right to
require us to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101%
(in the case of the Fixed Rate Notes) or 100% (in the case of the
Floating Rate Notes) of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any. See
‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control.’’

Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . . The Indenture will, among other things, limit our ability to:

             - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

             - pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or
redeem our stock;

             - make investments or certain other restricted payments;

             - create certain liens or enter into sale and lease-back
transactions;

             - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

             - enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’
ability to pay dividends; and

             - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

All of these limitations will be subject to a number of important
qualifications and exceptions. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—

Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the lenders under the Senior
Credit Facilities and ABN AMRO Bank, N.V. acting as security
agent on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities
and on behalf of the holders of the notes (the ‘‘Security Agent’’).
Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee will agree to
certain provisions that, among other things, give effect to the
subordination of the Guarantees and the funding loan. See

Transfers.’’

14


-----

Absence of a public market for
the notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes are new securities and there is currently no established
trading market for the notes. Accordingly, there can be no
assurances as to the development or liquidity of any market for the
notes. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to
make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do
so, and may discontinue any market making at any time at their
sole discretion and without notice.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA**

The summary historical consolidated financial data as of the end of and for the Fiscal 2001, Fiscal
2002 and Fiscal 2003 periods have been derived from the consolidated financial statements of Vendex KBB
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The summary historical consolidated financial data as of
the end of and for the Half Year 2003 and Half Year 2004 periods have been derived from the unaudited
interim consolidated financial information of Vendex KBB included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. The unaudited financial data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of results of the interim period and may not be indicative of
future financial results.

Our financial reporting highlights the performance over time of those businesses that we continue to
operate. Accordingly, items reported as being for ‘‘continued activities’’ in all fiscal periods reflect the
performance only of the activities that we continue to engage in at present. As such, for all fiscal periods,
‘‘continued activities’’ refers to our DIY, HEMA, Apparel, Bijenkorf, V&D and Consumer Electronics
business units, our Propcos and our other activities (in each case as described herein). Accordingly, in any
fiscal period ‘‘discontinued activities’’ are those businesses which we owned during (at least part of) that
period but which we no longer own.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data has been prepared in
accordance with Dutch GAAP and has been derived from the historical consolidated financial information
of the issuer and Vendex KBB. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data gives
effect to the Refinancing, the Property Transaction, and the deconsolidation of the Propcos which are
‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’ under the terms of the Indenture, as if they had occurred on August 1, 2004.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated profit and loss account data gives effect to the
Refinancing, the Acquisition, the Property Transaction and the deconsolidation of the Propcos, as if they
had occurred on February 2, 2003. See ‘‘The Acquisition, the Property Transaction and Related
Transactions’’ and ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

The Acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under Dutch GAAP.
Under this method, assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values on the date of purchase. The total
purchase price in excess of the preliminary estimate of fair value of the assets acquired (including both
tangible and identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed resulted in the creation of goodwill. We
have not yet completed our final assessments of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and
accordingly cannot assure you that our actual results will be the same or similar to those presented in the
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are
reasonable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is for informational purposes only,
and does not purport to present what our results of operations and financial condition would have been
had these transactions actually occurred, nor does it project our results of operations for any future period
or our financial condition at any future date.

Our historical consolidated financial statements and our unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
information are presented in euro and are prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP, which differs in certain
significant respects from IFRS. The material differences between Dutch GAAP and IFRS as they relate to us
are discussed in ‘‘Annex A—Summary of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS.’’

You should read this summary historical financial data and unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial information in conjunction with ‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical Consolidated
Financial Data,’’ ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects,’’ ‘‘Annex A—Summary of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP
and IFRS’’ and the audited and unaudited historical and pro forma consolidated financial statements and
the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) Restricted Group excludes the Propcos. The Propcos are ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’ under the terms of the Indenture and
are not subject to the restrictive covenants of the Indenture.

(2) See ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Recent Developments’’ for a discussion of certain key accounting
consequences relating to the possible sale of IMpact.

(3) In accordance with guidelines published in November 2002 by the Dutch Council for Annual Reporting, we have changed
our revenue recognition policies to align with IFRS. The change has been reflected for all periods beginning after
February 3, 2002 and accordingly our Fiscal 2001 is not presented on a comparable basis.

(4) Financial income and expenses includes one-time costs of A49 million in Half Year 2004, which relates to the repayment of
financial indebtedness as a result of the Acquisition.

(5) Represents changes in value of, and income from, receivables forming part of fixed assets, and in the value of, and income
from, securities.

(6) Other represents extraordinary expenses after tax of A48 million for Fiscal 2001 and represents results from participating
interests for all other periods.

(7) We anticipate using A53 million of our cash to purchase the remaining shares of Vendex KBB and to pay outstanding fees
associated with the Acquisition. This would result in remaining available cash of A145 million as of August 1, 2004.

(8) Represents third-party interest-bearing indebtedness.

(9) Cash flow from operations (continued activities) represents operating result from continued activities plus depreciation and
amortization, plus or minus movements in inventories, debtors, short-term liabilities, operating provisions and other
movements. For the avoidance of doubt this amount has not been reduced by consolidated interest expense and taxation on
continued activities because such amounts cannot be allocated between continued and discontinued activities.

(10) Operational working capital is calculated as inventories plus debtors less short-term liabilities.

(11) Net rental expense represents aggregate rental expense paid to third-parties less rental income received from third-parties,
pro forma periods include rental expense payable to the Propcos.

(12) Depreciation expense is primarily reflected in selling and distribution costs in the consolidated financial statements elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

(13) Amortization expense is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(14) EBITDA from continued activities represents operating result before discontinued activities, depreciation and amortization.
EBITDAR from continued activities represents EBITDA from continued activities before net rental expense. These
measures are presented because we believe that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. However, other companies in our industry may calculate them
differently than we do. EBITDA from continued activities and EBITDAR from continued activities are not measurements of
financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash
flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net income as indicators of our operating
performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with Dutch GAAP. The following table presents
the calculation of these measures:

(a) Represents costs recorded in connection with the restructuring of V&D. In Fiscal 2002 the charge amounted to
A48 million, offset by a withdrawal of provisions relating to exceptional V&D inventory reduction of A18 million. In
Fiscal 2003 the charge amounted A80 million, offset by a release of provisions of A6 million.
(b) Represents restructuring provisions recorded in connection with restructuring at M&S of A2 million and Bijenkorf of
A3 million.
(c) Represents direct costs primarily associated with the Acquisition.
(d) Represents the loss on the sale of the Sittard IT facility, offset by a gain related to the termination of a contract for the
distribution of mobile telephones (Consumer Electronics).
(e) Represents for Fiscal 2003 primarily a charge recorded of A6 million due to the early termination of a pension contract
offset by A1 million of other gains. The charges are included in Other in our segmental financial data.
For a further description of certain of the adjustments set forth above, see ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.’’

(17) Cash interest expense represents interest expense excluding amortization of debt issuance costs of A5 million.

(18) Net debt represents gross third-party interest-bearing indebtedness less cash, as adjusted to reflect the payment of additional
Acquisition costs.

(19) Represents rental payments to the Propcos from the operating companies, less operating costs and charges.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves risks. In addition to the other information contained in this offering_
_memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the notes._
_Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or which we currently believe are immaterial_
_may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the possible_
_events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be_
_materially and adversely affected. If that happens, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the_
_notes when due and you could lose all or part of your investment._

**Risks Relating to Us and Our Business**

**_Our high leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or_**
**_results of operations._**

We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. The degree to which we will
be leveraged could have important consequences to you, including, but not limited to:

   - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, other business expansion opportunities and other corporate requirements;

   - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the
payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, leaving this cash flow unavailable to
fund operations, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry; and

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations.

Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations
as well as our ability to service our debt obligations, including the notes.

We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could be senior to the notes
or the Guarantees or which could mature prior to the notes. The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities,
the Indenture and certain of our other senior indebtedness restrict us from incurring additional
indebtedness, but do not prohibit us from doing so. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would
increase the leverage-related risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_We are subject to certain restrictive debt covenants, which limit our operating flexibility._**

Our Senior Credit Facilities, Mortgage Loan and Indenture contain covenants which impose
significant restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

   - incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness of others;

   - make acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;

   - dispose of assets;

  - consolidate or merge with or into other companies; or

   - create certain liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions.

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our
ability to pursue business opportunities, or make changes to our business operations that may be in
your interest.

21


-----

**_We are significantly affected by general economic conditions in the Netherlands and across Europe._**

We generated 82% of our turnover in the Netherlands in Fiscal 2003. Our results are therefore
primarily impacted by the prevailing economic climate, levels of employment, salaries, wage rates, the
availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence, and consumer perceptions of economic conditions
in the Netherlands. According to the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics, Dutch consumer confidence,
in spite of a recent improvement, still remains at a low level. Despite a recent but moderate increase in
the GDP growth rate of the Netherlands, a continuous rise in unemployment over the last three years
and the uncertain economic outlook have adversely affected consumer spending habits. In Half Year
2004, retail sales in the Netherlands declined across almost all product categories. This had a negative
impact on, and may continue to have a negative impact on, our turnover. Moreover, many of the items
that we sell represent discretionary purchases, particularly in our Bijenkorf business unit, which means
that we may experience a decline in sales that is proportionally greater than the level of general
economic decline. We also operate in other European countries, where we generated 18% of our
turnover in Fiscal 2003, and as a result we are also impacted by the economic conditions in these
countries. Therefore, an economic downturn or continued weakness in consumer spending in the
Netherlands and across the rest of Europe could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We operate in competitive markets._**

All of our business units operate in competitive markets. We compete with a wide variety of
retailers of varying sizes and covering different product categories. Some of our competitors are general
retailers that compete with us in a number of product groups, while others are specialist retailers that
compete with us only in single product categories.

Actions taken by our competitors, as well as actions taken by us to maintain our competitiveness
and reputation, have placed and will continue to place pressure on our merchandise pricing, margins
and profitability. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources, greater purchasing
economies of scale and lower cost bases than us, any of which may give them a competitive advantage
over us. These factors have had in the past, and could have in the future, a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We believe that the non-food retail market is relatively more stable in the Netherlands than in
many other countries, partly due to regulatory restrictions on out-of-town building developments. Any
change in such zoning regulations could therefore favor, to a certain extent, new market entrants and
therefore have a material adverse effect on our operations.

**_We may be unable to implement our business strategy._**

Our future financial performance and success largely depend on our ability to implement our
business strategy successfully. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business
strategy as described in this offering memorandum or those to be developed in the future or that
implementing this business strategy will sustain or improve and not harm our results of operations. In
particular, we may not be able to achieve cost savings or working capital improvements, apply best
practices across business units, achieve greater standardization and consistency in our IT systems or
secure quality store locations at reasonable rates. In addition, the success of our selective expansion
strategy will depend upon our ability to open and operate new stores on a timely and cost-effective
basis while continuing to increase sales at our existing stores. There can be no assurance that the
opening of new stores will not result in the diversion of sales from our existing stores in certain cases,
thereby reducing existing store sales and resulting in lower operating profit. Any failure to develop,
revise or implement our business strategy in a timely and effective manner could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our V&D business unit has been experiencing significant losses and may continue to be unprofitable._**

V&D, one of our department store business units, reported operating losses of A39 million (before
restructuring costs of A80 million) in Fiscal 2003 and A24 million in Half Year 2004. In Fiscal 2003, we
designed a comprehensive restructuring plan for V&D that is currently being implemented. See
‘‘Summary—Our Strategy—Continue to Implement the V&D Restructuring Plan.’’ While a significant
portion of the cash outflows relating to the restructuring plan have occurred in Fiscal 2003 and Half
Year 2004, we expect to incur additional cash outflows over the coming years as part of the continuous
implementation of the measures under the V&D restructuring plan, and for which provisions have been
made. See ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.’’ In
addition, we cannot assure you that the operating profits of V&D will improve or that we will be
successful in re-establishing historic levels of profitability. If the operating profits of V&D fail to
improve, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

**_We may not be able to predict or fulfil customer preferences or demand accurately._**

The demand for a significant portion of the products we sell is subject to rapidly changing
customer tastes. The availability of new products and changes in customer preferences have made it
more difficult to predict or fulfil sales demand accurately. Our success depends in part on our ability to
effectively predict and respond to quickly changing consumer demands and preferences, and to
translate market trends into appropriate, saleable merchandise offerings. Many of our suppliers are
located in the Far East, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The long lead times between ordering
and delivery make it more important to predict, and more difficult to fulfil, the demand for items
accurately. We cannot assure you that our orders will match actual demand. If we are unable to
successfully predict or respond to changing styles or trends or if we misjudge the market, our sales will
be lower and we may be faced with a substantial amount of unsold merchandise or missed sales
opportunities. In response, we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to
dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_Our business could suffer as a result of weak sales during peak selling seasons._**

Our business is subject to seasonal peaks. Historically, our most important trading period in terms
of turnover, operating results and cash flow has been the Christmas season, with approximately 19% of
our sales occurring from the second half of November to the end of December. We incur significant
additional expenses in advance of the Christmas season in anticipation of higher sales during that
period, including for acquiring additional inventory, advertising, and hiring additional employees. Past
turnover trends indicate that, in addition to the Christmas season, peaks in turnover occur during April
and September as a result of promotional events and seasonal sales, and in the spring and summer for
our DIY business unit. If for any reason turnover during our peak seasons, particularly the Christmas
season, is significantly lower than expected, we may be unable to adjust our expenses in a timely
fashion and may be left with a substantial amount of unsold inventory, especially in seasonal
merchandise that is difficult to clear. In that event, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or
promotional sales to dispose of excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business can be adversely affected by severe or unseasonal weather conditions._**

Our results are affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonal weather conditions. Periods
of warm or cold weather could also render a portion of our inventory incompatible with such
unseasonal conditions. Adverse weather conditions early in the season could have a double impact on
our profitability, leading to a slowdown in sales at full margin followed by more extensive markdowns
at the end of the season. Prolonged unseasonal weather conditions or temporary severe weather during

23


-----

one of our peak trading seasons, such as the Christmas season, could adversely affect our turnover and,
in turn, our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, heavy snowfall or other extreme weather
conditions, such as floods, may make it difficult for our employees and customers to travel to our
stores.

**_Our properties are subject to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations._**

Operations at our retail facilities and distribution centers are subject to a variety of risks,
including: natural disasters; terrorism and acts of violence; damage to the buildings; failure to comply
with applicable regulations, including zoning and environmental regulations, and to maintain necessary
permits and approvals; equipment failure; and work stoppages. In particular, three of our main retail
facilities are located close to the envisaged track of a new metro line in Amsterdam. While the
municipality of Amsterdam has provided assurances that the construction of the new metro line will not
disrupt our operations and we are negotiating an indemnification agreement with the municipality of
Amsterdam to compensate us in the event any such disruptions do occur, we cannot assure you that the
construction of the new metro line will not result in a reduced accessibility and limitations to the use of
the affected retail facilities. In addition, any major breakdown of plant or equipment, or IT systems, or
accident such as serious fire or flood, at any of our distribution centers may significantly impact our
ability to distribute products to our stores and maintain an adequate supply chain. Any significant
interruption in operations resulting from such events or other events could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may not be able to recruit or retain key management and personnel._**

Our success depends in part on the continued service of key members of our management team
and on our ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees. The successful
implementation of our strategy depends on the availability of skilled management, both at our head
offices and at each of our business units. If we or one of our business units lose one or more key
senior executives and fail to replace them in a satisfactory manner, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.

**_We depend on suppliers located outside the European Union for a significant portion of our products._**

We purchase a significant portion of our products in markets outside of the European Union,
principally in the Far East and Middle East. We face a variety of risks generally associated with doing
business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from these regions, including, among others,
political instability; increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods; imposition of duties
and taxes, other charges and restrictions on imports; currency and exchange rate risks; risks related to
labor practices, environmental matters or other issues in the foreign countries or factories in which our
merchandise is manufactured; delays in shipping; and increased costs of transportation. Any of these
risks, in isolation or in combination, could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and
results of operations. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future
operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of our foreign currency
exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. New initiatives may be proposed that
may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or
other trade sanctions that, if enacted, could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in
such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries. The future performance of
our business will partly depend on our foreign suppliers and may be adversely affected by the factors
listed above, all of which are beyond our control.

24


-----

**_Shop crime and fraud in our stores may adversely affect us._**

We seek to prevent shop crime and fraud in our stores. Accordingly, in recent years we have
invested in excess of A40 million annually in training, security techniques, preventive measures and
equipment, including through co-operative ventures with other retailers. Despite these efforts, shop
crime and fraud have continued to rise, and new methods of committing fraud continue to be
developed. There can be no assurance that continued or expanded efforts to counteract this trend will
be effective or that the cost of such efforts will not increase. The failure to control and reduce shop
crime and fraud in a cost-effective manner could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We depend heavily on our information technology systems to operate our business._**

Our business activities rely to a significant degree on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of
our various computer and communications systems and those of third parties. Any significant
breakdown of plant or equipment, accidents, such as a serious flood or fire, or other significant
disruption to the operations of our primary sites for all of our computer and communications systems
could significantly affect our ability to manage our information technology systems, which in turn could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we plan to implement major changes to the information technology systems at several
of our business units. We expect that our information technology systems will require continuous
enhancements and ongoing investments as we integrate and continue to improve them to manage our
inventory. Our inability to integrate and upgrade these systems in a timely and cost effective manner or
the failure of these systems to adequately address our needs could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any negative impact to our coverage funding ratio or adverse change in the accounting standards applicable_**
**_to our pension funds could have an adverse effect on us._**

The coverage funding ratios of pension plans throughout the Netherlands, including Vendex
KBB’s, have been adversely affected by recently volatile and declining equity markets. Vendex KBB’s
main pension fund, Stichting Pensioenfonds Vendex KBB, had a coverage funding ratio of 103% of its
pension obligations as of February 1, 2004. Pursuant to a recovery plan, approved by the Dutch pension
regulator (Pensioen & Verzekeringskamer), Vendex KBB is required to raise this coverage funding ratio
to 126% by 2014. To achieve this goal, in January 2002, Vendex KBB increased its total cash
contributions from 12.6% in 2001 to 15.0% in 2002 and to 17.6% in 2003 of the total wages for the
main pension plan (after applying a non pensionable salary amount currently set at A16,543 per
employee) and from 3% to 4% in 2003 of the total wages for the early retirement pension plan. In
addition, as of January 1, 2004, Vendex KBB raised the early retirement age from 62 to 63. If despite
these additional contributions the pension fund’s funding levels fail to improve, Vendex KBB may have
to negotiate additional changes to its pension plan with the trade unions and may need to obtain
further approvals from the Dutch pension regulator. Possible changes thereto could include a one-time
cash injection into the fund, an increase in Vendex KBB’s ongoing cash contributions, an increase in
the employees’ cash contributions, a suspension or reduction of future indexation or, in extreme cases,
a reduction of benefits. If Vendex KBB were required to increase its cash contribution into the pension
scheme, either as a one-time injection or on an ongoing basis, such payments could negatively impact
our ability to conduct our operations and service our debt obligations, including the notes.

25


-----

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of and value associated with our brand names could adversely affect_**
**_our business._**

Our brand names represent an important asset of our business. Maintaining the reputation of, and
value associated with, our brand names is central to the success of our business, but there can be no
assurance that our business strategy and its execution will accomplish this objective. In addition, our
franchised stores make us dependent on third-party franchisees to operate their businesses effectively,
on ethical and commercially reasonable terms, and in a manner that does not negatively impact our
reputation. Substantial erosion in the reputation of, or value associated with, our brand names could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of the notes._**

The members of the Consortium may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures,
additional financing or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance the value of their
equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of notes. In
addition, members of the Consortium or their affiliates may, currently or in the future, own businesses
that directly compete with ours.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and for other general corporate purposes. Our_**
**_ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures,
will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends,
to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many
of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and additional debt and
equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when
due, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. For a discussion of our cash flows and
liquidity, see ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.’’

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the notes, and any future debt that we may
incur, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**_The issuer is a holding company and is dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to_**
**_make payments on the notes._**

The issuer is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through holding
companies and their operating subsidiaries. Other than the funding loan and the equity of VDXK, the
issuer does not have any significant assets and does not, and will not, conduct any revenue-generating
operations. The issuer will therefore be dependent upon the cash flow from its subsidiaries and the

26


-----

receipt of funds from them in the form of dividends, other distributions, intercompany loans or
payments under the funding loan.

In addition, even if our subsidiaries generate sufficient cash from their operations, their ability to
provide funds to Vendex KBB and the issuer is subject to, among other things, local tax restrictions,
restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Facilities and future loan agreements, and local corporate
law restrictions related to earnings, level of legal or statutory reserves, losses from previous years and
capitalization of our subsidiaries.

Although the Indenture limits the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to enter into consensual
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make payments, there are significant qualifications and
exceptions to these limitations.

**_The issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under the funding loan because the issuer’s right to_**
**_receive payments under the funding loan are contractually subordinated to other liabilities of Vendex KBB._**

The obligations of Vendex KBB under the funding loan are contractually subordinated to all
obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The ability of
the issuer to take enforcement action against Vendex KBB under the funding loan is subject to
significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement. The funding loan will also be subject to
a first priority pledge in favor of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities, and in order to
facilitate a sale of the surviving entity by the Senior Security Agent on behalf of the lenders under the
Senior Credit Facilities, all of the issuer’s rights in the funding loan may be disposed of (subject to
certain conditions), with the amounts realized being applied first to satisfy the obligations owing under
the Senior Credit Facilities.

As a result of the foregoing:

  - in the event of a bankruptcy, moratorium, winding-up or similar proceeding involving Vendex
KBB, including the appointment of an insolvency administrator or receiver or similar officer,
(i) the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities will be entitled to payment in full of all
obligations owing under the Senior Credit Facilities before the issuer would be entitled to
payments under the funding loan, and, as a result, before you would ultimately receive any
payments on the notes, (ii) the issuer will be required to turn over any amounts it receives under
the funding loan to the Senior Security Agent until all obligations owing under the Senior Credit
Facilities are paid in full, and (iii) the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of
Vendex KBB or any of its subsidiaries will be required to pay any amounts payable to the issuer
in respect of the funding loan to the Senior Security Agent until all amounts outstanding under
the Senior Credit Facilities are paid in full;

  - the Guarantors may not make payments with respect to the Guarantees and Vendex KBB may
not make payments with respect to the funding loan, in each case, in the event that any payment
has not been made when due in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities or a notice is served
declaring the Senior Facilities due and payable or payable on demand as a result of a payment
default with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities, and this prohibition will continue until there
is no outstanding payment default with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities or if the requisite
lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities consent to such payments;

  - the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities may prevent Vendex KBB from making payments
under the funding loan and the Guarantors from making payments with respect to the
Guarantees for a period of up to 179 days (or, if a standstill period has commenced during such
179-day period, for a period extending to the end of the standstill period) in the event that there
exists an event of default, other than a payment default, under the Senior Credit Facilities;

27


-----

   - the issuer has agreed to a 179-day standstill period on enforcement actions it could otherwise
take under the funding loan if there is an event of default under the notes; and

   - in the event that the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities obtain and enforce a first priority
security interest with respect to the funding loan, the issuer’s rights under the funding loan may
be assigned from the issuer to a third party, and the issuer would have no right, title or interest
under the funding loan or claims against Vendex KBB under the funding loan.

The notes and the funding loan may be subjected to similar restrictions in the future in favor of
future unsubordinated indebtedness of Vendex KBB or any of its subsidiaries.

**_Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the notes, and any claim by the issuer or any of its creditors,_**
**_including the holders of the notes, against such non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to_**
**_all of the claims of creditors of those non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our existing and future subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. As of August 1, 2004, after
giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing and the Property Transaction, on a consolidated basis the
issuer had total assets of A4,259 million and total liabilities, excluding shareholder’s equity, of
A2,808 million. As of August 1, 2004 and for the Last 12 Months ended August 1, 2004, the subsidiaries
of Vendex KBB that are Guarantors collectively held approximately 81% of the assets of Vendex KBB
excluding the Propcos, generated approximately 79% of the revenues of Vendex KBB excluding the
Propcos and 74% of the adjusted EBITDA of Vendex KBB excluding the Propcos. The Indenture does
not limit the transfer of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of our restricted subsidiaries,
including our non-guarantor subsidiaries. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.’’
Accordingly, non-guarantor subsidiaries could account for a higher portion of our assets, liabilities, net
sales and net income in the future.

In the event that one of our non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes,
dissolves or otherwise winds up, its assets will be used first to satisfy the claims of its creditors,
including its trade creditors, banks and other lenders. Consequently, any claim by the issuer or its
creditors, including holders of the notes, against a non-guarantor subsidiary will be structurally
subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary.

**_Enforcement of the Guarantees may be subject to certain limitations and will require satisfaction of certain_**
**_conditions._**

Under Dutch law, enforcement of the Guarantees may, in whole or in part, be limited to the
extent that the undertakings of each Guarantor under its Guarantee are deemed to be in conflict with
its objects (ultra vires). The issuing of such Guarantee may conflict with such Guarantor’s objects if
(i) the text of the objects clause in its articles of association (statuten) does not include a reference to
the issuance of guarantees to secure the obligations of affiliated companies and (ii) such Guarantor
does not, irrespective of the wording of the objects clause, derive certain direct or indirect commercial
benefit from the offering in respect of which such Guarantee is issued.

In addition, the ability to take enforcement action against the Guarantors under the Guarantees is
subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of such
Guarantees. As a result:

  - in the event a bankruptcy, moratorium, winding up or similar proceeding involving a Guarantor,
including the appointment of an insolvency administrator or receiver or similar officer, (i) the
lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities will be entitled to payment in full of all obligations
owing under the Senior Credit Facilities before the Trustee and the holders of the notes would
be entitled to payments under the Guarantee, (ii) the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions, and
the holders of the notes will be required to turn over any amounts they receive under the

28


-----

Guarantee to the Senior Security Agent until all obligations owing under the Senior Credit
Facilities are paid in full, and (iii) the person responsible for the distribution of the distributing
assets of a Guarantor will be required to pay any amounts payable to the Trustee and the
holders of the notes under the Guarantee to the Senior Security Agent until all obligations
owing under the Senior Credit Facilities are paid in full;

  - the Guarantors may not make payments under the Guarantees in the event of a payment default
under the Senior Credit Facilities and this prohibition will continue until there is no outstanding
payment default under the Senior Credit Agreement, if the requisite lenders under the Senior
Credit Facilities consent to such payments or if the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities
have been repaid in full and all commitments thereunder cancelled;

  - the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities may prevent the Guarantors from making
payments to the Trustee and the holders of the notes under the Guarantees for a period of up
to 179 days (or, if a standstill period has commenced during such 179-day period, for a period
extending until the end of the standstill period) in the event that there exists an event of default,
other than a payment default, under the Senior Credit Facilities; and

   - the Trustee has agreed to a 179-day standstill period on enforcement actions it could otherwise
take against the Guarantors in respect of the Guarantees for an event of default under the
notes.

In addition, the Guarantees may be subject to similar restrictions in the future in favor of future
unsubordinated indebtedness of the issuer or any of its subsidiaries.

The Guarantees are also subject to release under certain circumstances, including but not limited
to the sale of any Guarantor pursuant to an enforcement of security over the shares of any such
Guarantor or a holding company of that Guarantor, provided that certain requirements with respect to
such enforcement are satisfied. See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

As a result of these and other provisions in the Guarantees and the Intercreditor Agreement, you
may not be able to recover any amounts from the Guarantors under the Guarantees in the event of a
default on the notes and certain of the Guarantees may be released without any recovery being
available.

**_Dutch insolvency laws to which we are subject may not be as favorable to you as United States or other_**
**_insolvency laws._**

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EU
Insolvency Regulation’’), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in
relation to the issuer or any Guarantor will be the court of the Member State (other than Denmark)
where the company concerned has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of
such EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such issuer or any Guarantor has its
‘‘center of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which the courts of the different EU Member States
may have differing and even conflicting views. It should also be noted that no final decisions have been
taken in cases that have been brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to questions of
interpretation or the effects of the EU Insolvency Regulation throughout the European Union.
Furthermore, ‘‘center of main interests’’ is not a static concept and may change from time to time.
Although under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation there is a rebuttable presumption that
any such issuer or any Guarantor has its ‘‘center of main interests’’ in the Member State in which it has
its registered office, Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘center of main
interests’’ of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and ‘‘is therefore ascertainable by third parties’’. In that respect factors
such as the place for the holding of board meetings, the place where the issuer or any Guarantor

29


-----

conducts the majority of its business and the place where the large majority of the issuer’s or any
Guarantor’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the
issuer or any Guarantor has its ‘‘center of main interests.’’

If the center of main interests of any such issuer or any Guarantor is and will remain located in
the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the issuer or
any Guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and
accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency
proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened
in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognised in other Member
States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member
State. If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark)
under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than
Denmark) may open ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in
the territory of such other Member State. If the issuer or Guarantor does not have an establishment in
any other Member State, no court of any other Member State shall have the ability to open territorial
proceedings in respect of such issuer or Guarantor under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The issuer and all of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and have
their centers of main interest outside the United States. Therefore, any insolvency proceedings in
relation to the issuer and/or the Guarantors would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law. Dutch
insolvency law differs significantly from insolvency proceedings in the United States and may make it
more difficult for holders of notes to recover the amount they would normally expect to recover in a
liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the United States.

There are two primary insolvency regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments
(surs´eance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and
enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily
designed to liquidate and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a debtor to its creditors. Such
liquidation should also take place by way of a going concern sale. Both insolvency regimes are set forth
in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act.

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself. Upon
commencement of moratorium of payments proceedings, the court will grant a provisional moratorium.
Unless a draft composition (akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for moratorium of
payments, a meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. The definitive
moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (one-quarter in amount of claims held
by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or one-third in number of creditors represented at
such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. In both
cases, the moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors.
Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings (under US bankruptcy law) during which both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of
payments, under Dutch law, secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security
authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the issuer and/or the Guarantors to satisfy their
claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. However, the court may order a ‘‘cooling down
period’’ for a maximum period of two months during which enforcement actions by secured creditors
are barred. The maximum period of such a ‘‘cooling down period’’ is likely to become four months by
the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005, when Bill 27 444 would enter into force. In a moratorium of
payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. Such a composition will be binding on
all unsecured and non-preferred creditors if it is approved by a qualified majority of (i) two-thirds in
number of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing 75% in amount of the
claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the
court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce the recovery of a holder of notes in a Dutch

30


-----

moratorium of payments proceedings. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a
moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition.

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the
proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors on the basis of the relative claims of those creditors.
Certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special
rights that may adversely affect the interests of holders of notes. For example, secured creditors may
enforce their rights against assets of the issuer and/or the Guarantors to satisfy their claims under a
Dutch bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your
potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, the
court may order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ for a maximum of two months (or four months in the near
future) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred. The claim of a creditor may
be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms.
Generally, claims of the holders of notes which were not due and payable by their terms on the date of
a bankruptcy of the issuer and/or the Guarantors, will be accelerated and become due and payable as
of that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the receiver of the issuer and the
Guarantors to be verified. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value
of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceeding. The
valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy
proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date
of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatie-vergadering), the
receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other
creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors meeting may be
referred to a separate court proceeding (renvooi procedure). These renvooi procedures could cause
holders of notes to recover less than the principal amount of their notes or less than they could recover
in a US liquidation. Such renvooi procedures could also cause payments to the holders of notes to be
delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. Further, in a bankruptcy a composition may be
offered to creditors, which may be binding on creditors in the same manner as set forth above in
relation to a moratorium. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes
of creditors. A contractual subordination of the Guarantees in respect of certain other indebtedness of
the issuer and/or the Guarantors will be given effect, as much as possible under Dutch law, in
accordance with such contract terms.

A receiver in bankruptcy can force the secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a
reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any,
and the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs. Excess proceeds of enforcement
must be returned to the issuer in its insolvency; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of
the secured creditor on the issuer. Such set-off is allowed prior to the issuer’s insolvency.

Simultaneously with the opening of the issuer’s bankruptcy, a Dutch receiver or administrator will
be appointed. Such appointment will have an overriding effect on the appointment of a receiver as set
out in the relevant security documents. The appointment of such receiver cannot prevent the issuer
from being declared bankrupt in the Netherlands. Any future rights or assets acquired by the issuer
after it has been declared bankrupt or after it has been granted a moratorium of payments will not be
subject to the security interests created by the relevant security documents.

**_We may not be able to finance the change of control offer required by the Indenture._**

Upon a change of control, as defined under the Indenture, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to 101% (in the case of the Fixed Rate
Notes) or 100% (in the case of the Floating Rate Notes) of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were
to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at the time to pay the

31


-----

purchase price of the outstanding notes or that the restrictions in the agreements governing our Senior
Credit Facilities would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in
an event of default under our Senior Credit Facilities and may cause the acceleration of other
indebtedness which may be senior to the notes or rank equally with the notes. In any case, we expect
that we would require third-party financing to make a change of control offer. We cannot assure you
that we would be able to obtain this financing. See ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’

**_We have not included US GAAP or IFRS financial information, and we are not required by the Indenture to_**
**_supply separate financial data with respect to the Guarantors in the future._**

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with Dutch GAAP, which differs in certain
significant respects from IFRS and US GAAP. We have not presented a reconciliation of our financial
statements to IFRS or US GAAP in this offering memorandum. Moreover, we do not intend to, and
the Indenture will not require us to, reconcile future financial statements to IFRS or US GAAP.
Because there are significant differences between Dutch GAAP, IFRS and US GAAP, there may be
substantial differences in our results of operations and financial position, including debt levels, if we
were to prepare our financial statements in IFRS or US GAAP instead of Dutch GAAP. In particular,
our operating income and EBITDA could be materially different under IFRS and US GAAP. See
‘‘Annex A—Summary of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS.’’ The financial terms
in covenants under the Indenture will be based on Dutch GAAP as applied by Vendex KBB on
February 1, 2004 for the notes (unless Vendex KBB elects to use IFRS or US GAAP in the future),
and accordingly there may be a difference between our reported results in the future and certain
covenant calculations under the Indenture.

We are presently considering whether to adopt IFRS but have made no final decision. If in the
future we elect to adopt IFRS or US GAAP, then the Indenture will permit us to report according to
such standards, and the covenant calculations will be based on the relevant standards as in effect on
the date of our election. There could be significant differences between our reported results under our
adopted standards and our results under Dutch GAAP, and between such reported results and the
results upon which the covenant calculations will be based. We will not be required to reconcile these
differences. In addition, our covenants may become more or less restrictive from time to time,
depending upon the effect of the standards that we adopt. This could result in our being able to take
actions which might be to your detriment—such as incurring greater debt than would otherwise have
been possible—or not take actions that would otherwise be to your benefit—such as making profitable
investments or acquisitions.

We have not presented separate financial statements or summary financial data for the Guarantors
and we are not required by the Indenture to do so in the future.

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers._**

We are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, a majority of our assets are outside the
United States and our directors and officers live outside the United States. Our auditors are also
organized outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult to serve process against any of
these persons in the United States. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in the
Netherlands of civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United
States. See ‘‘Enforcement of Certain Civil Liabilities.’’

**_Transfer of the notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the notes._**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any United States
securities laws and we have not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the notes in the future.
You may not offer the notes for sale in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a

32


-----

transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. The notes and the Indenture will
contain provisions that will restrict the notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except
pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions,
under the Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not registered the notes under any other country’s
securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the notes within the United
States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

**_You may not be able to sell your notes._**

The notes are new securities for which there is no established market. We cannot assure you as to:

   - the liquidity of any market that may develop for the notes;

   - your ability to sell your notes; or

   - the prices at which you will be able to sell your notes.

Future trading prices of the notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Additionally, under
IFRS the Dutch Hybrid Instruments would be likely to be classified as debt. The trading prices of the
notes may be affected if we begin reporting under IFRS, or Dutch GAAP migrates towards IFRS, and
we are required to account for the Dutch Hybrid Instruments as debt. See ‘‘Description of Certain
Indebtedness—Dutch Hybrid Instruments’’ and ‘‘Annex A—Summary of Significant Differences
Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS.’’ The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to
make a market in the notes. However, they are not obliged to do so, and any market making may be
discontinued at any time without notice.

The liquidity of a trading market for the notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in
the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is
possible that the market for the notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a
negative effect on you, as a holder of the notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance.

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the notes._**

The notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euro, an investment in the notes will entail the risk of possible
significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency which you measure the return on
your investments against caused by economic, political and other factors over which we have no
control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which you measure the return on
your investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the notes below their stated coupon
rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the notes is translated into the currency by
reference to which you measure the return on your investments. In addition, there may be tax
consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from an investment in the
notes.

**THE ACQUISITION, THE PROPERTY TRANSACTION AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

On April 26, 2004, Vendex KBB and VDXK, an acquisition vehicle controlled by investment funds
advised by KKR and AlpInvest, announced the key terms of a recommended cash offer for all the
outstanding share capital of Vendex KBB. On August 3, 2004, after the closing of the Tender Offer and
the subsequent post-acceptance period, Vendex KBB was delisted from Euronext Amsterdam and
VDXX owned 99.56% of its total outstanding share capital. The funding of the Acquisition amounted
to approximately A2.5 billion and consisted of:

   - A970 million of equity and equity related financing;

  - A550 million of Term Loans;

  - a A600 million Mortgage Loan;

   - a A350 million Bridge Facility; and

  - A55 million of existing indebtedness of Vendex KBB that was retained.

On August 5, 2004, investment funds advised by KKR syndicated part of their indirect equity
interest in VDXK to investment funds advised by Cinven and investment funds advised by Permira. See
‘‘Principal Shareholders.’’

On or about September 30, 2004, the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans was increased
by A75 million to A625 million and the aggregate principal amount of the Bridge Facility was reduced
by A75 million to A275 million.

**The Property Transaction**

As part of the financing of the Acquisition, our Propcos, which are ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’
under the terms of the Indenture and are not subject to the restrictive covenants of the Indenture, have
borrowed, on a limited recourse basis as described below, A600 million under the Mortgage Loan.

The Mortgage Loan is expected to be serviced by the rents paid by HEMA, Bijenkorf and V&D to
our Propcos for the use of the 71 stores and three parking lots owned by the Propcos. The rental
payments to be received by the Propcos from our operating business units for Fiscal 2004 amount to
A65 million. Furthermore, prior to July 5, 2004, some of the operational fixed assets related to rented
stores (such as fixtures and fittings) were reported as being leased by the Propcos to HEMA and
Bijenkorf. On July 5, 2004, we modified this reporting methodology by allocating to the relevant
business unit these operational fixed assets, with an aggregate value of approximately A50 million.
Accordingly, going forward, our business units will not be charged any rent for these operational fixed
assets, which rental payments totaled A7.5 million for Fiscal 2003. In order to compensate the Propcos
for this reduction in rental income, we have increased the aggregate annual rental payments on
properties to our Propcos by a corresponding A7.5 million. The lenders under the Mortgage Loan do
not benefit from any direct guarantee or credit support from our operating business units and have no
direct recourse against the assets of our operating business units, other than a first ranking pledge over
the shares of the Propcos, a rental shortfall guarantee by Vendex KBB to the Propcos for the rental
obligations of our operating business units and an assignment of an indemnity agreement from
Vendex KBB and other operating companies in favor of the Propcos relating to certain tax, pension
and other liabilities against which the Propcos are entitled to indemnification. The Propcos have also
assigned their rights to receive rental payments to the lenders under the Mortgage Loan. The lenders
under the Mortgage Loan benefit from a first priority mortgage over the properties owned by the
Propcos. The lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities benefit from a second ranking mortgage over
the properties owned by the Propcos and a second ranking pledge over the shares of the Propcos. The

34


-----

Senior Credit Facilities contain certain covenants restricting the ability of our operating business units
to, among other things, grant loans or guarantees to, assume any liabilities of, or enter into lease
agreements other than on arm’s-length terms with, the Propcos. These covenants are subject to certain
exceptions, including loans to the Propcos to pre-finance capital expenditures in a maximum aggregate
amount of A10 million at any time, obligations under certain lease agreements, certain management and
indemnity agreements and the Propcos’ tax liabilities. See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness.’’

A portion of the proceeds received under the Mortgage Loan has been used by our Propcos to
repay their existing debt and certain transaction costs. The remaining part of the proceeds, representing
A481 million, have subsequently been loaned to Vendex KBB through an intercompany loan (the
‘‘Subordinated Propco Proceeds Loan’’), and then used by Vendex KBB to repay part of its existing
debt.

On September 30, 2004, the receivable arising for the Propcos out of the Subordinated Propco
Proceeds Loan was purchased by VDXK from the Propcos in consideration for a limited recourse note.
VDXK in turn contributed the Subordinated Propco Proceeds Loan receivable to Vendex KBB in
exchange for equity and equity-related instruments. As a result, the borrower and the lender under the
Subordinated Propco Proceeds Loan were consolidated in Vendex KBB, and the Subordinated Propco
Proceeds Loan was extinguished. The issuer then assumed VDXK’s position as a debtor under the
limited recourse note in exchange for equity-related instruments issued by VDXK. Victoria Acquisition
II B.V., the parent company of the issuer, then assumed the issuer’s position as debtor under the
limited recourse note in exchange for equity-related instruments issued by the issuer, resulting in the
removal from the Restricted Group of the liability on the limited recourse note to the Propcos.

We refer to these transactions, together, as the ‘‘Property Transaction.’’

**The Related Transaction**

On September 13, 2004, Vendex KBB converted from a public limited liability company (N.V.) to a
private limited liability company (B.V.). Having completed the conversion of Vendex KBB into a private
limited liability company, we initiated a squeeze-out procedure which will result in VDXK owning
100% of Vendex KBB. The squeeze-out procedure is expected to be completed in the next six months.
Subsequently, Vendex KBB is expected to merge into VDXK. While this merger is expected to take
place after the completion of the squeeze-out procedure, under certain circumstances, the Consortium
may cause the merger to occur prior to the completion of the squeeze-out procedure.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds of this offering will be approximately A275 million. The issuer
will lend the principal amount of the offering to Vendex KBB pursuant to a funding loan. Vendex KBB
will in turn use the amounts received under the funding loan and cash on hand of A9 million to repay
the principal amount outstanding under the Bridge Facility and the fees and expenses of the
Refinancing. The Bridge Facility currently bears an interest rate of 700 bps above EURIBOR and has a
scheduled maturity date of July 5, 2005. See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness.’’

(1) Cash includes A5 million owned by the Propcos. As adjusted cash is decreased by A53 million to
reflect anticipated payments to purchase the remaining shares of Vendex KBB and to pay
outstanding fees associated with the Acquisition.

(2) The Propcos are ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’ under the Indenture and are not subject to the
restrictive covenants of the Indenture. For a description of the Mortgage Loan, see ‘‘The
Acquisition, the Property Transaction and Related Transactions—The Property Transaction’’ and
‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Mortgage Loan.’’

(3) Group equity includes A947 million of equity-related instruments (also referred to as ‘‘Dutch
Hybrid Instruments’’) with characteristics similar to permanent equity. In connection with the
Property Transaction, we issued an additional A481 million Dutch Hybrid Instruments to Victoria
Acquisition II B.V., our parent, in exchange for its assumption of liability under a limited recourse
note payable to the Propcos. Under IFRS, these Dutch Hybrid Instruments would be likely to be
treated as a liability, and for certain purposes under the Indenture, these Instruments will be
treated as indebtedness. However, given their current treatment under Dutch GAAP, we have
described the Dutch Hybrid Instruments as a form of equity throughout this offering
memorandum. See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Dutch Hybrid Instruments,’’
‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and ‘‘Annex A—Summary of Significant Differences Between Dutch
GAAP and IFRS.’’

**SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA**

The selected historical consolidated financial data as of the end of and for the Fiscal 2001, Fiscal
2002 and Fiscal 2003 periods have been derived from the consolidated financial statements of Vendex
KBB included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The selected historical consolidated financial
data as of the end of and for the Half Year 2003 and Half Year 2004 periods have been derived from
the unaudited interim consolidated financial information of Vendex KBB included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum. The unaudited financial data includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of results of the interim period and may not be
indicative of future financial results.

Our financial reporting highlights the performance over time of those businesses that we continue
to operate. Accordingly, items reported as being for ‘‘continued activities’’ in all fiscal periods reflect
the performance only of the activities that we continue to engage in at present. As such, for all fiscal
periods, ‘‘continued activities’’ refers to our DIY, HEMA, Apparel, Bijenkorf, V&D and Consumer
Electronics business units, our Propcos and our other activities (in each case as described herein).
Accordingly, in any fiscal period ‘‘discontinued activities’’ are those businesses which we owned during
(at least part of) that period but which we no longer own.

The issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of Half Year 2004
reflects the Acquisition. The Acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting under Dutch GAAP. Under this method, assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair
value on the date of purchase. The total purchase price in excess of the preliminary estimate of fair
value of the assets acquired (including both tangible and identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities
assumed resulted in the creation of goodwill. We have not yet completed our final assessments of the
fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and accordingly cannot assure you that our actual results
will be the same or similar to those presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Our historical consolidated financial statements are presented in euro and are prepared in
accordance with Dutch GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from IFRS. The material
differences between Dutch GAAP and IFRS as they relate to us are discussed in ‘‘Annex A—Summary
of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS.’’

You should read this selected historical consolidated financial data in conjunction with
‘‘Capitalization,’’ ‘‘Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial
Review and Prospects,’’ ‘‘Annex A—Summary of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP and
IFRS’’ and the audited and unaudited historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(1) See ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Recent Developments’’ for a discussion of certain key accounting
consequences of the possible sale of IMpact.

(2) In accordance with guidelines published in November 2002 by the Dutch Council for Annual Reporting, we have changed
our revenue recognition policies to align with IFRS. The change has been reflected for all periods beginning after
February 3, 2002 and accordingly our Fiscal 2001 is not presented on a comparable basis.

(3) Financial income and expenses includes one-time costs of A49 million in Half Year 2004, which relates to the repayment of
financial indebtedness as a result of the Acquisition.

(4) Represents changes in value of, and income from, receivables forming part of fixed assets, and in the value of, and income
from, securities.

(5) Other represents extraordinary expenses after tax of A48 million for Fiscal 2001 and represents results from participating
interests for all other periods.

(6) Represents third-party interest-bearing indebtedness.

40


-----

(7) Cash flow from operations (continued activities) represents operating result from continued activities plus depreciation and
amortization, plus or minus movements in inventories, debtors, short-term liabilities, operating provisions and other
movements. For the avoidance of doubt this amount has not been reduced by consolidated interest expense and taxation on
continued activities because such amounts cannot be allocated between continued and discontinued activities.

(8) Operational working capital is calculated as inventories plus debtors less short-term liabilities.

(9) Net rental expense represents aggregate rental expense paid to third-parties less rental income received from third-parties.

(10) Depreciation expense is primarily reflected in selling and distribution costs in the consolidated financial statements elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

(11) Amortization expense is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(12) EBITDA from continued activities represents operating result before discontinued activities, depreciation and amortization.
EBITDAR from continued activities represents EBITDA from continued activities before net rental expense. These
measures are presented because we believe that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested
parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. However, other companies in our industry may calculate them
differently than we do. EBITDA from continued activities and EBITDAR from continued activities are not measurements of
financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to cash
flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net income as indicators of our operating
performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with Dutch GAAP. The following table presents
the calculation of these measures:

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information of the issuer has been
prepared in accordance with Dutch GAAP and has been derived from the historical financial
information of the issuer and Vendex KBB.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet gives effect to the Refinancing,
the Property Transaction and the deconsolidation of the Propcos as if they had occurred on August 1,
2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated profit and loss accounts give effect to the
Refinancing, the Acquisition (taking into account the matters disclosed in note 7), the Property
Transaction, and the deconsolidation of the Propcos as if they had occurred on February 2, 2003.

The Acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under Dutch
GAAP. Under this method, assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values on the date of
purchase. The total purchase price (including cost directly related to the Acquisition) in excess of the
preliminary estimate of fair value of the assets acquired (including both tangible and identifiable
intangible assets) and liabilities assumed resulted in the creation of goodwill. We have not yet
completed our final assessments of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and accordingly
cannot assure you that our actual results will be the same or similar to those presented in the following
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information.

The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and assumptions that we believe
are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is for informational
purposes only, and does not purport to present what our results of operations and financial condition
would have been had these transactions actually occurred, nor does it project our results of operations
for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read in
conjunction with the ‘‘Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Data,’’ ‘‘Selected Historical
Consolidated Financial Data,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,’’ our historical
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and the historical consolidated financial statements of
Vendex KBB, each included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information does not give effect to the annual fee
of A2.0 million to be paid to the Consortium. See ‘‘Certain Relations and Related Party Transactions.’’

**Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet**
**(all amounts in E millions, except percentages)**

1. Represents the estimated debt issuance costs associated with the borrowings used to redeem the
Bridge Facility including the increase in the Senior Credit Facilities and the issuance of the notes.
The classifications of these costs is consistent with prior accounting treatment by Vendex KBB,
under which debt issuance costs were capitalized and included within debtors on the balance sheet.

2. Represents the decrease in cash resulting from the payment of the estimated debt issuance costs
and the accrued interest related to the Bridge Facility.

3. Represents the adjustments to give effect to the changes in outstanding borrowings in connection
with repayment of the Bridge Facility as follows:

Short-term loans:

4. Before giving pro forma effect to the Property Transaction, the lender and borrower of the
A481 million Subordinated Propco Proceeds Loan were each members of the issuer’s consolidated
reporting group, resulting in no recognition on the consolidated financial information of the
receivable or payable associated therewith. As a result of the Property Transaction, the receivable
held by the Propcos must be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet.

5. Represents the issuance of equity-related instruments (Dutch hybrid instruments) to Victoria
Acquistion II B.V. by the issuer in connection with the Property Transaction.

6. Represents the deconsolidation of the Propcos, which are the Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the
Indenture. These shares and assets serve as security for the Mortgage Loan which is an obligation
of the Propcos. These amounts are derived as follows:

**Historical** **Acquisition** **Pro Forma**
**Propcos[(A)]** **Adjustments** **Reclassification** **Propcos**

Tangible fixed assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 454.9 345.5[(B)] — 800.4

**(all amounts in E millions, except percentages)**

(B) Represents the revaluation of tangible fixed assets (less one-month depreciation) in connection
with the Acquisition that is not reflected in the historical Propcos’ balance sheet.

(C) Represents the deferred tax liability associated with the revaluation of the tangible fixed
assets.

(D) Represents the indirect investment of the issuer in the Propcos. The reclassification is made in
order to present the investment in the Propcos as financial fixed assets of the Restricted
Group.

(E) Represents ordinary course receivables from the Restricted Group. The reclassification is
made in order to present the obligation to the Propcos as a short-term liability of the
Restricted Group.

7. The accounting for the Acquisition has been based on a preliminary purchase price allocation. The
preliminary allocation resulted in a net increase in depreciable tangible fixed assets of
A253.3 million and the recognition of A848.6 million of goodwill. This adjustment represents:

   - the increase in depreciation expenses resulting from the net adjustment in tangible fixed assets
depreciated over an estimated economic life ranging from 4 to 40 years. This depreciation has
been historically recorded in selling and distribution costs by Vendex KBB; and

  - the increase in amortization expenses for the goodwill recognized and amortized over a period
of 20 years. The goodwill amortization is historically included in general administrative expenses
by Vendex KBB.

We also recorded an increase of A69.2 million to record land at its estimated fair value, which is
not depreciated.

**Fiscal** **Half Year** **Half Year**
**2003** **2003** **2004**

Depreciation expense (included in selling and distribution
costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.9 1.0 1.0
Amortization expense (included in general administrative
expenses) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42.4 21.2 21.2

The actual amortization and depreciation expense may change from this estimate upon the
finalization of the purchase price allocation. The preliminary allocation is based upon estimates we
believe are reasonable and is subject to revision as additional information becomes available.

The pro forma Acquisition adjustments to the profit and loss account do not give effect to the
different accounting principle for employee benefits as compared to Vendex KBB, because doing
so would have involved the use of estimates that are currently based on preliminary and overall
calculations only. On a pro forma basis, the effect of this adjustment would have resulted in lower
employee benefit costs and therefore higher pro forma operating result. The different accounting
principle has no impact on cash flows.

8. We incurred costs directly associated with the Acquisition that have been reflected in the historical
profit and loss account. This represents the elimination of these direct charges and consists of the
following:

Fiscal 2003:
Professional advisers fees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.5

Total exceptional charges on Acquisition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.5

Half Year 2004:
Professional advisers fees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14.6
Redemption of stock options . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.6

Total exceptional charges on Acquisition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22.2

These adjustments are offset against the increase in amortization expense described above to
derive the pro forma adjustment to general and administrative expenses.

Pro forma adjustment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 57.0 (27.7) 31.2

(A) The Senior Credit Facilities require us to enter into derivative instruments to fix the interest
rate on a minimum of 50% of the outstanding borrowings. We have assumed that the
minimum amount has been hedged.

(B) Interest on the Term Loan A is payable at EURIBOR (assumed at 2.12%) plus a margin
ranging from 2.25% to 1.25%. We have assumed a margin of 2.25%. For the hedged portion
of Term Loan A we have assumed a fixed rate of 3.52% plus the margin of 2.25%, based on
the average swap rate for the next three years.

(C) Interest on the Term Loan B is payable at EURIBOR (assumed at 2.12%) plus a margin
ranging from ranging from 2.75% to 2.25%. We have assumed a margin of 2.75%. For the
hedged portion of Term Loan B we have assumed a fixed rate of 3.52% plus the margin of
2.75%, based on the average swap rate for the next three years.

(D) Interest on the Term Loan C is payable at EURIBOR (assumed at 2.12%) plus a margin of
3.25%. For the hedged portion of Term Loan C we have assumed a fixed rate of 3.52% plus
the margin of 3.25%, based on the average swap rate for the next three years.

(E) Interest on the Bridge Facility is payable at EURIBOR (assumed at 2.12%) plus a margin of
7% (increasing upwards from six months after the initial borrowing date). We have assumed a
margin of 7%.

(F) The Mortgage Loan requires us to enter into derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on
a minimum of 75% of the borrowings. Interest on the Mortgage Loan is payable at
EURIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. For the hedged portion of the borrowings we have

51


-----

**Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Profit and Loss Accounts**
**(all amounts in E millions, except percentages)**

assumed a fixed rate of 3.58% plus a margin of 1.75%, based on the average swap rate for the
next five years. In addition, we have an interest cap for our remaining interest rate exposure.
The assumed rate for the remaining part of the mortgage loan reflects EURIBOR (assumed
at 2.12%) plus a margin of 1.75% plus a cap premium of 0.38%. Should EURIBOR rise
above 3.75% the maximum interest on the non-hedged portion of the mortgage loan is 5.88%,
including margin and the cap premium.

(G) Interest on the retained indebtedness represents the actual historical interest expense.

(H) This represents debt issuance costs and commitment fees associated with our senior
indebtedness. The debt issuance costs are amortised over the terms of the debt instrument
which ranges from 7 to 10 years.

The EURIBOR rate applied is based on the historical 6-month rate at August 1, 2004. The effect
on the pro forma income of a change of 0.125% in EURIBOR interest rates on the variable rate
debt would be approximately A0.4 million for the Half Year 2004, A1.0 million for the Fiscal 2003,
and A0.5 million for the Half Year 2003.

10. Represents incremental tax effect, at an assumed tax rate of 34.5%. There is no tax effect included
for the amortization of goodwill.

11. We intend to use the proceeds of the Refinancing and cash on hand to repay the Bridge Facility
together with accrued interest and fees associated with the notes offered hereby. The following pro
forma adjustments reflect the repayment of the Bridge Facility:

**Interest**
**rate (%)** **Amount** **Interest**

(A) We have assumed interest rate of 8.00%. The effect on the pro forma result on ordinary
activities before tax of a 0.125% change in this rate would be approximately A0.3 million on an
annual basis and A0.2 million for a half year.

(B) Interest on the Term Loan B is payable at EURIBOR (assumed at 2.12%) plus a margin
ranging from 2.75% to 2.25%. We have assumed a margin of 2.75%. We have assumed 50%
of the borrowings will be hedged and for that portion have assumed a fixed rate of 3.52% plus
the margin of 2.75%, based on the average swap rate for the next three years.

a fixed rate of 3.52% plus the margin of 3.25%, based on the average swap rate for the next
three years.

(D) Reflects the amortization of estimated debt issuance costs of the notes and increased Senior
Credit Facilities over an average life of 8 to 10 years. In addition, this assumes that the debt
issuance costs related to the Bridge Facility will continue to be amortized over the life of the
facilities which were used to redeem the Bridge Facility.

12. Represents interest income associated with the loan to Victoria Acquisition II B.V. of A481 million.
The interest rate assumed is equal to the average interest cost of the Mortgage Loan plus margin
of 0.13% (approximately 5.39%).

**Overview**

We are the leading non-food retailer in the Netherlands with an estimated 8% overall market
share and with expanding operations in Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain.
We were created in 1999 through the merger of two of the oldest and largest retail groups in the
Netherlands, Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB, which were
founded respectively in 1887 and 1870. We are organized into six main business units: DIY; HEMA
(variety store); Apparel; Bijenkorf and V&D (both department stores); and Consumer Electronics. In
addition, we also operate a number of smaller retail-related and service businesses. Our business units
comprise a total of 15 retail formats, which we believe represents a diversified portfolio of
well-established brands, many of which are household names in the Netherlands.

We operate 1,785 stores, both directly and through franchises, representing approximately two
million square meters of net retail space. We estimate that, in the Netherlands alone, our retail formats
collectively receive an average of eight million visitors per week.

**Significant Factors Affecting our Results of Operations**

**_The Acquisition, Property Transaction and Related Transactions_**

In the future, we intend to report results of operations for the issuer and its consolidated
subsidiaries. Such results of operations may not be comparable to our previously reported results of
operations due to the Acquisition, the application of purchase accounting adjustments related thereto,
and the Property Transaction. In particular:

   - the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Acquisition and related transactions
significantly increases our interest expense;

   - the substantial indebtedness incurred to finance the Acquisition has significantly increased our
total liabilities; and

55


-----

   - the significant adjustment to goodwill and tangible/intangible assets recorded in connection with
the Acquisition and related transactions has led to a significant increase in amortization and
depreciation expenses.

For information regarding the nature and pro forma effect of the above-mentioned adjustments on
the results of operations of the issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries, see ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.’’

In addition, included in this offering memorandum are the results of operations of the issuer and
its consolidated subsidiaries for Half Year 2004, which results contain adjustments for the Acquisition
and the application of purchase accounting adjustments related thereto. These results only reflect the
results of operations of Vendex KBB and its consolidated subsidiaries from July 5, 2004, the effective
date of the Acquisition, and are therefore not directly comparable to the results of operations of
Vendex KBB and its subsidiaries, which do not contain such adjustments.

**_Streamlining of Retail Formats—Discontinued Operations_**

Since the merger of Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB in
1999, we have sold or liquidated 16 retail formats. These events have resulted in a substantial change in
the composition of our group. As a result of our various disposals and terminations, our results from
discontinued activities have varied significantly between the periods discussed below, and certain of the
disposals have also impacted other portions of our profit and loss account, such as taxation. The most
significant retail format disposals and terminations that we have made are described below.

In the course of Fiscal 2001, the Amici operations were wound down and store leases and staff
were transferred to a third party. The Amici sale had no impact on our operating result as the net
premiums received in connection with the transfer of leases and the release of a provision previously
taken for restructuring offset operational losses from Amici in Fiscal 2000 up to the announcement
date.

During Fiscal 2001, we sold the US toy chain FAO Schwarz in an asset sale. Out of a total of
42 stores, 25 stores were transferred to the buyer in exchange for a vendor note and an equity stake in
the buyer, both of which we valued at zero. The remaining 17 stores were discontinued. In connection
with this disposal we recognized a book loss of A160 million, covering pre-transaction operational losses
in Fiscal 2001 and all closure, restructuring and wind down costs. The transaction qualified as a
liquidation of a foreign subsidiary under Dutch income tax laws, which allowed us to take all
cumulative losses since the acquisition of FAO Schwarz by N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB in
the early 1990s, including the capital loss on the sale, against Dutch profits. This resulted in a tax credit
of A82 million in Fiscal 2001.

During Fiscal 2002, we completed a packaged sale (the ‘‘Packaged Sale’’) of six operating
companies operating ten retail formats in a variety of product groups (including shoes, jewellery, optics,
baby and maternity apparel and sportswear and sporting articles), which resulted in a book profit of
A145 million. This transaction led to a substantial simplification of our group. The ten retail formats
involved represented nearly half of our retail formats, but only approximately 15% of net turnover in
Fiscal 2001. We also terminated the operations of a Consumer Electronics retail format in Fiscal 2002
and separately disposed of a smaller Apparel retail format which together resulted in a book loss of
A4 million.

In addition, during Fiscal 2002 we restructured our central information technology (‘‘IT’’)
organization and, following the Packaged Sale, we disposed of our Sittard IT location, which had
primarily serviced the businesses sold. The resulting one-time loss of A15 million was recorded under
‘‘Other.’’

56


-----

We include the turnover and results of the disposed or terminated retail formats in the
discontinued activities sections of our profit and loss account. Turnover and operating result from
discontinued activities reflect the turnover and operating result from the businesses that we disposed of
or terminated. Operating result from discontinued activities also reflects the book gains and losses that
we record in connection with the disposals or terminations as well as any costs relating to such
disposals or terminations.

**_Expansion and Acquisitions_**

We have actively pursued the development and expansion of a selected number of retail formats
both through the opening of new stores as well as the acquisition of whole businesses or groups of
stores. In a number of cases this has taken the group into new geographical markets within Europe.
These expansion activities have significantly affected our results of operations from continued activities
in the periods discussed below.

Our Apparel business unit has grown predominantly by organic expansion. M&S grew rapidly in
France, adding a total of 60 stores since the beginning of Fiscal 2001 through the end of Half Year
2004. In Fiscal 2002, we opened two pilot M&S stores in Spain. Following the success of the pilot
program, we decided to continue the expansion and have opened an additional seven stores in Spain
through Half Year 2004. Hunkem¨oller significantly expanded its operations in Denmark by opening a
further eight stores since the beginning of Fiscal 2001 through the end of Half Year 2004 and, following
the success of its pilot program, opened a further ten stores in France in the same period. In addition
to expanding into new markets, Hunkem¨oller opened a further ten stores in the Netherlands and seven
stores in Germany during the same period.

Our HEMA business unit has also expanded both in the Netherlands and in other countries. Since
Fiscal 2001, HEMA opened 16 stores in the Netherlands, 15 stores in Belgium and three pilot stores in
Germany.

In Fiscal 2002, we acquired the Belgian DIY operations of Brico, the market leader in Belgium,
which took us into the Belgian market with 97 stores that we continue to operate under the Brico retail
format. The inclusion of Brico for ten months of Fiscal 2002 added A310 million of net turnover,
representing 29% of net turnover from continued activities in the DIY business unit in Fiscal 2002. In
addition, we acquired seven megastores in Belgium from Leroy Merlin and Castorama effective July
2003 and August 2003, respectively. In all, our DIY business unit grew from A737 million annual net
turnover in Fiscal 2001, to A1,289 million in the Last 12 Months.

We will continue to consolidate our leading market positions in the Netherlands through selective
investments that meet our stringent return on capital requirements. We will also selectively pursue the
international growth of those retail formats that have demonstrated the potential to be successful in
other European countries. We have identified our DIY, HEMA and Apparel business units as the most
suitable for international expansion.

**_V&D Restructuring_**

V&D has experienced serious difficulties in recent years. In Fiscal 2002, V&D reported a
A59 million operating loss, which included a one-time charge of A48 million (of which we subsequently
withdrew A18 million) taken in connection with the clearance of older merchandise and various
revitalization measures. In Fiscal 2003, our V&D business unit reported an operating loss of
A39 million excluding the A80 million one-time charge relating to the V&D restructuring plan
announced in September 2003 of which A60 million related to a reduction of 1,800 FTEs and
A20 million related to the closing of 12 V&D department stores. The difficulties at V&D were the
result of several factors, including a promotion-driven purchasing strategy and outdated supply chain
management. These problems were compounded by a lack of coherent positioning within and among

57


-----

product categories and the complexity of operating too many small stores with marginal contributions
in terms of profitability. The first measures of the restructuring plan announced in Fiscal 2003 have
already resulted in annualized cost savings of approximately A50 million. With the business now
stabilized, we are focused on improving gross margin and re-invigorating V&D’s like-for-like sales
growth through a complete renewal of styling, product offering, advertising and branding and the
introduction of a new store concept. See ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental—V&D’’ below and
‘‘Business—Our V&D Operations’’ for further discussion of both V&D’s recent results and the
restructuring program.

**_Seasonality and Weather_**

Our business is highly seasonal. For most of our business units, our most important trading period
in terms of turnover, operating result and cash flow is the Christmas season (the second half of
November through December). Spring and summer are also important periods for our DIY business
unit.

Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal or unseasonal weather conditions. Adverse
weather conditions early in the season have a double impact on profitability, leading first to a
slowdown in sales at full margin, usually followed by more extensive markdowns at the end of the
season.

**_General economic conditions in the Netherlands_**

As discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Us and Our Business—We are significantly
affected by general economic conditions in the Netherlands and across Europe,’’ our results are
affected by general economic conditions, primarily in the Netherlands. While we have expanded beyond
the Netherlands in recent years, the Netherlands currently is still our most significant market,
representing approximately 82% of our net turnover in Fiscal 2003. According to the Dutch Central
Bureau of Statistics (‘‘CBS’’), consumer confidence in July 2003 was at the lowest point since the early
1980s. Since then, consumers have become more positive about the economic situation, but according
to the CBS, consumer confidence still remains at a low level. According to the CBS, GDP increased by
1.4% and 0.6% in 2001 and 2002, respectively, and declined by 0.9% in 2003. After three consecutive
quarters with a positive quarter-on-quarter GDP growth corrected for seasonal effects and working
days, GDP decreased by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2004. According to the CBS, the July 2004,
interannual inflation rate in the Netherlands was at 1.1% which was the second lowest in the
Euro-zone after Finland. According to the CBS, unemployment has risen almost continually over the
last three years with an average of 6.4% of the labor force unemployed in the period May-July 2004.
According to the CBS, in the second quarter of 2004, retail trade in the Netherlands saw its turnover
decline by 2.4% compared to the same quarter of 2003. In addition, according to the CBS, turnover of
retail trade in each of the last five quarters has been lower than in the same respective quarters of the
previous year.

**Recent Developments**

In connection with the evaluation of the possible sale of all or part of our Consumer Electronics
business unit, discussions have been progressing with a number of interested parties. Since July 31,
2004, we have commenced negotiations regarding the sale of our interest in IMpact, which comprises
the retail formats It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper. If a transaction is concluded at the price
forming the basis of the current negotiations, management expects that, in the accounts of Vendex
KBB, the disposal would result in a pre-tax book loss of approximately A30 million, which management
believes is tax deductible, resulting in an estimated book loss on disposal after tax of A20 million. If no
transaction is concluded, management believes it has opportunities to improve the operating
profitability of IMpact. Management did not include an impairment loss on the accounts of
Vendex KBB in respect of IMpact in its Half Year 2004 financial statements. Had an impairment loss
been recorded based on the price forming the basis of the current negotiations, Vendex KBB would
have recorded the following accounting entries on its books: (i) a reduction in operating result of
approximately A30 million, (ii) a reduction in net result of approximately A20 million and (iii) a
reduction in group equity of approximately A20 million. These accounting entries would not have
affected cash flow or adjusted EBITDA amounts for the Half Year 2004 presented elsewhere in this
offering memorandum. Pending the outcome of negotiations, including the preparation and negotiation
of definitive documents, management has not made any decision to sell IMpact at the price forming
the basis of the current negotiations, and a transaction may or may not occur. If a transaction does
occur at the price forming the basis of current negotiations, Victoria Acquisition III B.V., the issuer,
would not record any impairment charge in its consolidated profit and loss accounts since, in
connection with its preliminary purchase accounting, the relevant assets were recorded at their then
estimated fair value.

**Results of Operations—Consolidated**

_Set forth below is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations. This discussion is followed by_
_a more detailed discussion of the results of each of our business units under the heading ‘‘—Results of_
_Operations—Segmental.’’_

**_Net Turnover_**

Net turnover represents the revenues from goods and services sold, net of VAT and sales
discounts. In the case of company-operated stores, the net turnover is determined based on the amount
paid by consumers net of VAT and sales discounts. In the case of franchise stores and concessions, net
turnover is based on the value of goods delivered to franchisees or concession holders, as well as the
franchise fees or the concessionary fees.

**_Changes to the principles for recording and presenting turnover_**

In accordance with a change to the Dutch guidelines for recording income (RJ 270 profit and loss
_account), the principles for recording and presenting turnover have been changed from Fiscal 2003._
Guideline 270 sets out detailed criteria in relation to the definition of income and when turnover is to
be recognized.

The table below shows the effect of the change, per year, on the net turnover per business unit.

The main reasons for the differences between the net turnover as per the former definition and as
per the new definition for Fiscal 2003 are as follows:

   - At HEMA, the point-of-sale turnover of the franchisees’ photo service and restaurant activities
were formerly presented as turnover, whereas under the new guideline only supplies to
franchisees may be presented as net turnover (effect –A19 million);

  - Sales by concession holders at Bijenkorf were formerly presented as turnover, whereas under the
new guideline only the fee may be presented as net turnover (effect –A25 million); and

   - In Consumer Electronics, turnover generated by sales of services such as service certificates and
extended guarantee insurance were formerly presented as other income, whereas the new
guideline states that it should be presented as turnover (effect +A12 million).

There are no implications for the operating result or the opening equity. The comparative figures
included in the following discussion have been adjusted accordingly.

60


-----

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover increased by A32 million, or 1.5%, from A2,137 million in Half Year 2003 to
A2,169 million in Half Year 2004. The acquisition of the seven Belgian Leroy Merlin and Castorama
DIY stores (which were both included for the entire period in Half Year 2004 as compared to Half
Year 2003 where the six Leroy Merlin DIY stores were included for only one month) contributed an
additional A57 million in net turnover, or an increase of 2.7%. Excluding this acquisition, net turnover
decreased by A25 million, or 1.2%. The decrease in net turnover, excluding the effect of acquisitions,
primarily resulted from lower net turnover in the V&D and Apparel business units, partially offset by
increased sales at DIY, Consumer Electronics, Other, HEMA and Bijenkorf.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

In Fiscal 2003 we changed the principles for recording and presenting turnover. As a result, the
comparative figure for consolidated net turnover of our continued activities for Fiscal 2003 has been
adjusted from A4,487 million, according to the former definition of recording and presenting turnover,
to A4,451 million, according to the new definition of recording and presenting turnover. Details of this
change are described above under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Consolidated—Changes to the principles
for recording and presenting turnover.’’

Net turnover decreased by A236 million, or 5.0%, from A4,687 million in Fiscal 2002 to
A4,451 million in Fiscal 2003. Net turnover in Fiscal 2002 included A360 million from discontinued
activities compared to none in Fiscal 2003. Net turnover from continued activities increased by
A124 million, or 2.9%, from A4,327 million in Fiscal 2002 to A4,451 million in Fiscal 2003. The increase
was entirely attributable to acquisitions, mainly Brico (which was included for the entire period in
Fiscal 2003 compared to ten months in Fiscal 2002), the six Belgian Leroy Merlin DIY stores (which
were included for approximately seven months in Fiscal 2003) and the one Belgian Castorama DIY
store (which was included for approximately six months in Fiscal 2003). Excluding the effect of
acquisitions, net turnover from continued activities increased in the HEMA, Bijenkorf and DIY
business units which increase was entirely offset by decreased sales at V&D and Consumer Electronics.
Net turnover in Apparel was essentially unchanged.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover decreased by A241 million, or 4.9%, from A4,958 million in Fiscal 2001 to
A4,717 million in Fiscal 2002. Net turnover in Fiscal 2001 included A940 million from discontinued
activities compared to A360 million in Fiscal 2002. Net turnover from continued activities increased by
A339 million, or 8.4%, from A4,018 million in Fiscal 2001 to A4,357 million in Fiscal 2002. It should be
noted that Fiscal 2002 had 52 weeks, while Fiscal 2001 had 53 weeks. Net turnover from continued
activities increased by 10.2% on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001. Of this, 7.7% was attributable to
acquisitions, mainly Brico in DIY, which was included in Fiscal 2002 results for approximately ten
months. The increase in net turnover from continued activities excluding the effect of acquisitions was
primarily the result of increased net turnover in our Apparel, Bijenkorf and DIY business units, which
was partially offset by decreased net turnover in V&D. HEMA also showed positive growth in net
turnover while Consumer Electronics was essentially unchanged.

**_Gross Operating Result_**

Gross operating result represents net turnover minus cost of sales. Our consolidated gross
operating result reflects the aggregate gross operating result of each of our business units. However,
our business units operate in different markets with varying gross margins (i.e., gross operating result as
a percentage of net turnover). Accordingly, our consolidated gross margin represents an aggregate
margin which is not necessarily indicative of developments in our individual business units. In addition,

61


-----

in accordance with Dutch GAAP, we are required to allocate certain distribution costs between cost of
sales (which impacts our gross operating result) and selling and distribution costs (which does not
impact our gross operating result). In certain circumstances, operational changes at our business units
can result in a re-classification of expenses between cost of sales and selling and distribution costs,
resulting in changes to our gross operating result and gross margin without changing our consolidated
operating result. As a result of the foregoing, we believe that it is more informative for investors to
focus on the operating results of our business units (which are described by business unit under the
caption ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental’’ below) rather than on our consolidated gross operating
result.

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Gross operating result increased by A9 million, or 1.2%, from A772 million in Half Year 2003 to
A781 million in Half Year 2004. Gross operating result as a percentage of net turnover from continued
activities remained essentially unchanged at 36.0% in Half Year 2004. V&D improved its gross
operating margin. Gross operating margins at DIY, HEMA, Apparel, Bijenkorf and Consumer
Electronics remained essentially unchanged. Gross operating margin of Other decreased significantly,
predominantly as a result of increased mark downs at Schaap & Citroen due to two store closures and
from lower selling prices at AudioSonic.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

As a result of the reclassification of certain income and expenses the comparative figure for gross
operating result in Fiscal 2002 has been increased by A22 million from A1,652 million to A1,674 million.
Previously an income of A18 million (primarily resulting from service certificates and extended
guarantee insurance) was accounted for in other operating income, which does not impact gross
operating result, but such income was reclassified as gross operating result. In addition certain
expenses, which add up to a net amount of A4 million, previously classified under cost of sales and
therefore impacting gross operating result, were reclassified to operating expenses, which do not affect
gross operating result.

Gross operating result decreased by A67 million, or 4.0%, from A1,674 million in 2002 to
A1,607 million in 2003. Gross operating result from continued activities increased by A77 million, or
5.0%, from A1,530 million in 2002 to A1,607 million in 2003. Gross operating result as a percentage of
net turnover from continued activities improved from 35.4% in 2002 to 36.1% in 2003. In Fiscal 2003
the gross operating result included A9 million of the A80 million charge we took in connection with
V&D’s restructuring as described below under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental—V&D.’’ The
gross operating result in Fiscal 2002 included A25 million of the A48 million one-time charge that we
took in connection with V&D’s revitalization program as described below under ‘‘—Results of
Operations—Segmental—V&D.’’ We subsequently withdrew A18 million of this charge in the course of
Fiscal 2002 as a result of the improved inventory position at V&D. Excluding the impact of these
one-time items, our gross operating result from continued activities increased by 5.1%. Gross margins
of Apparel, HEMA, DIY and Bijenkorf improved, while gross margins of Consumer Electronics and
V&D were essentially unchanged.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Gross operating result decreased by A107 million, or 6.1%, from A1,759 million in Fiscal 2001 to
A1,652 million in Fiscal 2002. Gross operating result from continued activities increased by A139 million,
or 10.2%, from A1,368 million in Fiscal 2001 to A1,507 million in Fiscal 2002. The gross operating result
in Fiscal 2002 included A25 million of the A48 million one-time charge that we took in connection with
V&D’s revitalization program as described below under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental—V&D.’’
We subsequently withdrew A18 million of this charge in the course of Fiscal 2002 as a result of the

62


-----

improved inventory position at V&D. Excluding the impact of this one-time charge and the subsequent
withdrawal, our gross operating result from continued activities increased by 10.7%. Gross operating
result as a percentage of net turnover from continued activities increased from 34.0% in Fiscal 2001 to
34.6% in Fiscal 2002. HEMA, Apparel, Consumer Electronics and the Dutch DIY business all
generated higher gross margins in Fiscal 2002. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in gross
margins at Bijenkorf, as a result of increased markdowns reflecting the decline in consumer confidence
in the Netherlands in Fiscal 2002, and at V&D, reflecting the revitalization charge mentioned above.

**_Net Operating Expenses_**

Net operating expenses consists of items reported in our profit and loss account in the lines
captioned ‘‘Selling and Distribution Costs,’’ ‘‘General Administrative Expenses’’ and ‘‘Other Operating
Income.’’

Selling and Distribution Costs consists of all costs allocable to selling and distribution activities,
including the costs of store premises, results on their disposal and results on redevelopment projects.
General Administrative Expenses represents the total general management costs of the individual parts
of our group, the costs of group management and other expenses not classified as cost of sales or
selling and distribution costs. Other Operating Income mainly relates to income in respect of fees based
on the sales of concessionaires in our stores and other commission income.

For our internal management control purposes we classify costs between ‘‘stores,’’ ‘‘distribution’’
and ‘‘head office’’ rather than Selling and Distribution Costs, General Administrative Expenses and
Other Operating Income, which are the classifications required by Dutch GAAP. In certain
circumstances, operational changes at our business units can result in a re-classification of expenses
between these three line items, without changing our consolidated operating result. Therefore we have
chosen to provide a commentary on the three items aggregated, which we call ‘‘net operating
expenses.’’ While this commentary may be helpful, we believe that it is more informative for investors
to focus on the operating results of our business units (which are described by business unit under the
caption ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental’’ below) rather than on our consolidated ‘‘net operating
expenses.’’

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net operating expenses increased by A36 million, or 5.0%, from A719 million in Half Year 2003 to
A755 million in Half Year 2004. This increase includes A18 million of net operating expenses
attributable to the inclusion of the seven Belgian DIY megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin and
Castorama for the entire period in Half Year 2004 compared to the inclusion of the six Leroy Merlin
DIY stores for only one month in Half Year 2003. In addition, net operating expenses in Half Year
2004 includes one-time costs related to the Acquisition of A22 million, charges of A3 million that we
took in connection with a restructuring plan at Bijenkorf, charges in total of A2 million related to
restructuring measures and an impairment of assets at M&S and A2 million of one-time costs related to
special projects at the holding company. After adjusting for these items, net operating expenses
decreased in Half Year 2004 by 1.5%. This decrease was due to the successful implementation of cost
savings measures at V&D partially offset by increased operating expenses at HEMA, Bijenkorf, DIY
and Apparel as a result of an increase in retail sales area and higher personnel costs resulting from
expansion.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

As a result of the reclassification of certain income and expenses the comparative figure for net
operating expenses in Fiscal 2002 has been increased by A22 million from A1,348 million to
A1,370 million. Previously an income of A18 million (primarily resulting from service certificates and

63


-----

extended guarantee insurance) was accounted for in other operating income, but such income was
reclassified as gross operating result resulting in increased net operating expenses. In addition certain
expenses, which add up to a net amount of A4 million previously classified under cost of sales and
therefore not impacting net operating expenses, were reclassified to operating expenses.

Net operating expenses increased by A176 million, or 12.8%, from A1,370 million in Fiscal 2002 to
A1,546 million in Fiscal 2003. Net operating expenses in Fiscal 2002 included the book profit of
A145 million that we recognized in connection with the Packaged Sale. Net operating expenses from
continued activities increased by A154 million, or 11.1%, from A1,388 million in Fiscal 2002 to
A1,542 million in Fiscal 2003. This increase includes A45 million of net operating expenses attributable
to the inclusion of Brico for the entire period in Fiscal 2003 compared to ten months in Fiscal 2002,
the six megastores acquired from Leroy Merlin for seven months in Fiscal 2003 and the one DIY store
acquired from Castorama for six months in Fiscal 2003. Net operating expenses in Fiscal 2003 included
A71 million of the A80 million one-time charge that we took in connection with V&D’s restructuring as
described below under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental—V&D,’’ a A6 million exceptional release
of provisions at V&D, a A5 million aggregate one-time charge, essentially related to the termination of
a contract with an insurance company and A5 million of gains on real estate development. Net
operating expenses in Fiscal 2002 included A23 million of the A48 million one-time charge that we took
in connection with V&D’s revitalization program as described below under ‘‘—Results of Operations—
Segmental—V&D,’’ a one-time gain of A7 million principally from the termination of a contract for the
distribution of mobile telephones at Consumer Electronics, a one-time charge of A15 million taken in
connection with the restructuring of our central IT operations, including a loss on the disposal of one
of our two IT locations, and A11 million of gains on real estate development. After adjusting for these
items and for the increase in net operating expenses attributable to the inclusion of Brico for the entire
period in Fiscal 2003, the six Leroy Merlin DIY stores acquired for seven months in Fiscal 2003 and
the one DIY store acquired from Castorama for six months in Fiscal 2003, the increase in net
operating expenses from continued activities in Fiscal 2003 was approximately 4.7%. This increase was
due to an increase in retail sales area, increased marketing expenditure at Praxis and HEMA, start up
costs of HEMA in Germany and continued expansion of M&S in France.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net operating expenses decreased by A310 million, or 18.7%, from A1,658 million in Fiscal 2001 to
A1,348 million in Fiscal 2002. Net operating expenses in Fiscal 2002 included the book profit of
A145 million that we recognized in connection with the Packaged Sale. Net operating expenses from
continued activities increased by A216 million, or 18.8%, from A1,149 million in Fiscal 2001 to
A1,365 million in Fiscal 2002. Of this increase, A90 million is attributable to the acquisition of Brico in
Belgium. In addition, net operating expenses in Fiscal 2002 included A23 million of the A48 million
one-time charge that we took in connection with V&D’s revitalization program as described below
under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental—V&D,’’ a one-time charge of A15 million taken in
connection with the restructuring of our central IT operations, including a loss on the disposal of one
of our two IT locations, and the net effect of A3 million of lower gains on real estate development.
Excluding the impact of the foregoing items, net operating expenses from continued activities increased
approximately 7% in Fiscal 2002. This increase was due to an increase in retail sales area, general
inflationary pressures, particularly on personnel and rental costs, start-up costs of HEMA in Germany,
amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of Brico, and accelerated expansion of M&S in
France, where operating costs are relatively high compared to the other countries where we operate.

**_Operating Result_**

Operating result represents the sum of the aggregated segmental operating result for all our
business units, minus the amortization of goodwill, the impact of property disposals and adjusted for
discontinued activities.

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Operating result decreased by A27 million, or 50.9%, from A53 million in Half Year 2003 to
A26 million in Half Year 2004. Operating result in Half Year 2004 includes a one-time cost for the
Acquisition of A22 million in the result of Half Year 2004, charges of A3 million that we took in
connection with a restructuring plan at Bijenkorf, A2 million related to restructuring measures and an
impairment of assets at M&S, and A2 million of one-time costs related to special projects at the holding
company. Excluding these charges, operating result increased by A2 million, or 3.8%, from A53 million
in Half Year 2003 to A55 million in Half Year 2004. The increase resulted primarily from the inclusion
of the seven Belgian megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin and Castorama for the entire period
in Half Year 2004 compared to the inclusion of the six Leroy Merlin DIY stores for only one month in
Half Year 2003. The operating result from V&D, Other, DIY and Consumer Electronics increased, but
these increases were offset by a decrease in operating result from Apparel, Bijenkorf and HEMA.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Operating result decreased by A243 million, or 79.9%, from A304 million in Fiscal 2002 to
A61 million in Fiscal 2003. Operating result in Fiscal 2002 included a contribution of A162 million from
discontinued activities (mainly resulting from the gain recognized on the Packaged Sale) compared to a
loss of A3 million in Fiscal 2003 (resulting from an expenditure of A7 million for the settlement of
pension commitments with a former company of the group partly offset by a gain related to the release
of a provision for the FAO Schwarz company which was sold in Fiscal 2002). Operating result from
continued activities decreased by A78 million, or 54.9%, from A142 million in Fiscal 2002 to A64 million
in Fiscal 2003. Operating result from continued activities in Fiscal 2003 included aggregate charges of
A80 million that we took in connection with the restructuring of V&D, a A6 million exceptional release
of provisions at V&D and a one-time aggregate charge of A5 million, essentially related to the
termination of a contract with an insurance company. Operating result from continued activities in
Fiscal 2002 included aggregate charges of A48 million that we took in connection with V&D’s
revitalization program (A18 million of which we subsequently withdrew in the course of Fiscal 2002 as a
result of the improved inventory position at V&D), a one-time gain of A7 million principally from the
termination of a contract for the distribution of mobile telephones at Consumer Electronics, and a
one-time charge of A15 million taken in connection with the restructuring of our central IT operations,
including a loss on the disposal of one of our two IT locations. Excluding these charges and the gain,
operating result from continued activities decreased by A37 million, or 20.6%, from A180 million in
Fiscal 2002 to A143 million in Fiscal 2003. This decrease resulted primarily from a significant decrease
in operating result from V&D and Apparel partially offset by an increase in operating result from DIY
and HEMA. Operating result from Bijenkorf and Consumer Electronics (excluding the one-time gain
described above) were essentially unchanged.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Operating result increased by A203 million, or 201%, from A101 million in Fiscal 2001 to
A304 million in Fiscal 2002. Operating result in Fiscal 2002 included a positive contribution of
A162 million from discontinued activities (mainly as a result of the gain recognized on the Packaged
Sale) compared to an operating loss of A119 million from discontinued activities in Fiscal 2001
(resulting primarily from the loss on the disposal of FAO Schwarz). Operating result from continued
activities decreased by A78 million, or 35.5%, from A220 million in Fiscal 2001 to A142 million in Fiscal

2002. Operating result from continued activities in Fiscal 2002 included aggregate charges of
A48 million that we took in connection with V&D’s revitalization program (A18 million of which we
subsequently withdrew in the course of Fiscal 2002 as a result of the improved inventory position at
V&D), a one-time gain of A7 million principally from the termination of a contract for the distribution
of mobile telephones at Consumer Electronics and a one-time charge of A15 million taken in
connection with the restructuring of our central IT operations, including a loss on the disposal of one
of our two IT locations. Excluding these charges and the gain, operating result from continued activities
decreased by A40 million, or 18.2%, in Fiscal 2002 compared to Fiscal 2001. This decrease primarily
resulted from significant decreases in operating result at Bijenkorf and V&D that were partially offset
by increases at DIY, HEMA, Apparel and Consumer Electronics.

**_Financial Income and Expenses_**

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Financial expenses increased by A58 million from A22 million in Half Year 2003 to A80 million in
Half Year 2004. Financial Expenses included one-time costs of A49 million related to the repayment of
financial indebtedness as a result of the Acquisition. Excluding these one-time costs, financial expenses
increased by A9 million, or 40.9%, from A22 million in Half Year 2003 to A31 million in Half Year 2004.
The increase in expenses primarily resulted from higher average interest rates following the refinancing
of November 2003 and higher average debt levels in Half Year 2004 compared to Half Year 2003.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Financial expenses remained unchanged at A49 million. Financial expenses in Fiscal 2003 included
A1 million of amortization of one-time expenses related to the refinancing of virtually the whole
interest-bearing debt and the available short-term credit lines in November 2003. Excluding this
one-time expense, interest costs decreased by 2.0% from A49 million in Fiscal 2002 to A48 million in
Fiscal 2003. The decrease primarily resulted from the reduction of debt levels following the Packaged
Sale partly offset by an increase in indebtedness associated with the acquisition of the seven Belgian
megastores from Leroy Merlin and Castorama and higher interest costs during the last two months of
Fiscal 2003 following the refinancing in November 2003.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Financial expenses decreased by A2 million, or 3.9%, from A51 million for Fiscal 2001 to
A49 million in Fiscal 2002. The decrease primarily resulted from the reduction in indebtedness resulting
from the Packaged Sale.

**_Changes in Value_**

Changes in value consists primarily of gains and losses recognized on disposal of participating
interests and unlisted securities and changes in the recorded value of financial fixed assets.

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

There were no changes in value recorded on this line item in Half Year 2004 and in Half Year
2003.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

There were no changes in value recorded under this line item in Fiscal 2003. In Fiscal 2002, we
recorded a loss of A16 million relating to the decrease in value of our participation in a number of
Brazilian shopping centers, which were sold in the second half of Fiscal 2002.

66


-----

_2002 Compared to 2001_

In Fiscal 2002, we recorded a loss of A16 million relating to the decrease in value of our
participation in a number of Brazilian shopping centers, which were subsequently sold. This compared
with a gain of A6 million that we recorded in Fiscal 2001, which mainly resulted from the sale of our
equity stake in an American sports retailer.

**_Taxation_**

The statutory corporate tax rate in the Netherlands was 34.5% for Fiscal 2003, 34.5% for Fiscal
2002 and 35% for Fiscal 2001.

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

We recorded a tax expense in Half Year 2003 of A11 million compared to a A15 million tax income
in Half Year 2004. The decrease in taxation primarily resulted from increased financial expenses and
the decrease in operating result.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Taxation decreased by A31 million from A35 million in Fiscal 2002 to A4 million in Fiscal 2003. The
change is illustrated in the following table:

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Taxation increased by A40 million from a tax credit of A5 million in Fiscal 2001 to a tax expense of
A35 million in Fiscal 2002. The change is illustrated in the following table:

**Fiscal** **Fiscal**
**2001** **2002**

The tax benefit in Fiscal 2001 on discontinued activities relates almost entirely to the disposal of
FAO Schwarz, as described above. The gain on the Packaged Sale was tax exempt under the rules of
the Dutch participation exemption for the purpose of corporate income tax. As a result, our effective
tax rate was reduced.

**_Extraordinary Expenses After Tax_**

There were no extraordinary expenses for Half Year 2004, Fiscal 2003 or Fiscal 2002.

We incurred A48 million of extraordinary expenses after taxes in Fiscal 2001, primarily relating to
additional contributions to our main pension fund. During Fiscal 2001, the legal predecessors of the
Stichting Pensioenfonds Vendex KBB (the N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer pension fund for 90% of

67


-----

our staff in the Netherlands), Stichting Pensioenfonds Confidentia (the Vendex International N.V.
pension fund prior to the merger) and Stichting Pensioenfonds KBB (the KBB pension fund prior to
the merger), merged, with retroactive effect from January 1, 2001. In conjunction with this merger of
the pension funds, we made an additional contribution in order to achieve financial equality between
the two funds when they merged.

**Results of Operations—Segmental**

_In order to present the operating results of each of our business units on a comparable basis, we have_
_adjusted the actual operating results of HEMA, Bijenkorf and V&D, which use the properties owned by the_
_Propcos, by charging them rent on these properties. The rental amount is determined in lease agreements_
_based on negotiations between the relevant business unit and the relevant Propco and is reflected in the_
_results of our Propcos. In addition, we have certain shared service companies that perform services for our_
_business units. The costs of these services are allocated to the business units at negotiated rates while the_
_payment for these services is reflected in ‘‘—Results of Operations—Segmental—Other.’’ The discussion of_
_our operating results by segment set forth below is based on the results of each business unit, adjusted as_
_described in this paragraph. Segmental operating result represents the operating profit of each of our_
_business units before goodwill and impact of property disposals._

_Net Turnover_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover in our DIY business unit increased by A69 million, or 11.0%, from A626 million in
Half Year 2003 to A695 million in Half Year 2004. The increase reflected the inclusion of turnover of
the seven Belgian megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin and Castorama for the entire period in
Half Year 2004 compared to the inclusion of the six Leroy Merlin DIY stores for only one month in
Half Year 2003. Excluding this acquisition, net turnover increased by A13 million, or 2.1%, from
A626 million in Half Year 2003 to A639 million in Half Year 2004. The Belgian operations experienced
an increase in like-for-like sales and added one new store in Half Year 2004. Net turnover of the Dutch
operations slightly decreased in Half Year 2004 as a result of a small decrease in like-for-like sales at
Praxis, partly offset by an increase in like-for-like sales at Formido and the opening of one new store.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

In Fiscal 2003 we changed the principles for recording and presenting turnover. As a result the
comparative figure for net turnover of Fiscal 2002 in our DIY business unit has been adjusted from
A1,066 million, according to the former definition of recording and presenting turnover, to
A1,063 million according to the new definition. Details of this change are described above under
‘‘—Results of Operations—Consolidated—Changes to the principles for recording and presenting
turnover.’’

68


-----

Net turnover in our DIY business unit increased by A157 million, or 14.8%, from A1,063 million in
Fiscal 2002 to A1,220 million in Fiscal 2003. The increase reflected the inclusion of turnover from Brico
for the entire period in Fiscal 2003 compared to ten months in Fiscal 2002, as well as the inclusion for
approximately seven months and six months, respectively, in Fiscal 2003 of the six Belgian megastores
we acquired from Leroy Merlin and the one Belgian DIY store we acquired from Castorama.
Excluding these acquisitions, net turnover increased by 2.4% in Fiscal 2003. Net turnover of the Dutch
operations increased 1.5% as a result of a slight increase in net turnover at Praxis and an increase in
net turnover at Formido. In Fiscal 2003, Praxis added four stores and acquired seven stores from
franchisees, while Formido closed three stores on a net basis. Brico experienced an increase in like-forlike sales and added three new franchise stores in Fiscal 2003.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover in our DIY business unit increased by A329 million, or 44.6%, from A737 million in
Fiscal 2001 to A1,066 million in Fiscal 2002. DIY’s increase in net turnover in Fiscal 2002 compared to
Fiscal 2001 was 46.6% on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001. The increase in net turnover primarily
resulted from the acquisition of Brico in Belgium, which was included in results for approximately ten
months in Fiscal 2002 and contributed A310 million of net turnover in Fiscal 2002. Net turnover in our
Dutch DIY operations increased by A19 million, or 2.6%, from A737 million in Fiscal 2001 to
A756 million in Fiscal 2002, equivalent to a 4.0% increase on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001. None of
this increase is attributable to store openings. In fact, the number of stores declined by one in the
Netherlands. Praxis achieved a growth figure that was somewhat higher than the aggregate 4.0% as
Formido’s net turnover actually declined due to the loss of one store and the high level of sales that we
achieved in Fiscal 2001 from promotions organized around Formido’s 25th anniversary. The growth in
net turnover for the Dutch DIY operations was greater than the overall 3% growth in the do-it-yourself
market in the Netherlands. The newly acquired Brico business in Belgium performed well over the
same period. Sales for the ten months for which Brico was consolidated in Fiscal 2002, were higher
than sales for the same period a year earlier (prior to acquisition by us), partially reflecting the
introduction of a successful new store concept and the opening of four new franchise stores.

_Segmental Operating Result_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Segmental operating result in our DIY business unit increased by A3 million, or 6.1%, from
A49 million in Half Year 2003 to A52 million in Half Year 2004. Excluding the effect of the inclusion of
the seven Belgian megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin and Castorama for the entire Half Year
2004 compared to the inclusion of the six megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin for approximately
one month in Half Year 2003, the segmental operating result increased by A1 million. The increase in
segmental operating result was due to increased gross operating result principally from net turnover
growth in Belgium, partly offset by increased net operating expenses due to expansion of our store
base. Gross operating margin slightly increased.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Segmental operating result in our DIY business unit increased by A4 million, or 5.1%, from
A78 million in Fiscal 2002 to A82 million in Fiscal 2003. Excluding the effects of the acquisition of Brico
for the entire period in Fiscal 2003 compared to ten months in Fiscal 2002, the effect of the six Belgian
megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin for seven months in Fiscal 2003 and the effect of the
Belgian DIY store we acquired from Castorama for six months in Fiscal 2003, the segmental operating
result increase was A3 million. The significant increase in the segmental operating result of Brico in
Fiscal 2003 was partially offset by the slightly lower segmental operating result of our Dutch DIY

69


-----

operations in Fiscal 2003 due to increased competitive pressure in the Dutch do-it-yourself market as
demonstrated by the relatively high number of price promotions.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Segmental operating result in our DIY business unit increased by A21 million, or 36.8%, from
A57 million in Fiscal 2001 to A78 million in Fiscal 2002. Of this increase, A14 million is attributable to
the inclusion of Brico for ten months of Fiscal 2002. Our Dutch DIY operations showed an increase in
segmental operating result of A7 million, or 12.3%, from A57 million in Fiscal 2001 to A64 million in
Fiscal 2002. Although our gross margin increased, the impact of this on our segmental operating result
was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that was proportionally greater than our sales
in Fiscal 2002 due to inflationary pressures. Brico had a good year (prior to the acquisition by us) with
segmental operating result growing significantly from the prior year.

_Net Turnover_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover in our HEMA business unit increased by A4 million, or 0.9%, from A426 million in
Half Year 2003 to A430 million in Half Year 2004. The increase in net turnover was entirely attributable
to expansion of our store base. In Half Year 2004, we opened five stores in Belgium and three in the
Netherlands. Excluding this expansion, the net turnover decreased slightly as a result of lower like-forlike sales in the Netherlands, partly offset by an increase in like-for-like sales in Belgium.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

In Fiscal 2003 we changed the principles for recording and presenting turnover. As a result the
comparative figure for net turnover of Fiscal 2002 in our HEMA business unit has been adjusted from
A933 million, according to the former definition of recording and presenting turnover, to A911 million,
according to the new definition. Details of this change are described above under ‘‘—Results of
Operations—Consolidated—Changes to the principles for recording and presenting turnover.’’

Net turnover in our HEMA business unit increased by A7 million, or 0.8%, from A911 million in
Fiscal 2002 to A918 million in Fiscal 2003. Excluding the effects of store expansion, net turnover
decreased by 0.7%. In Fiscal 2003 we opened six directly operated and two franchise stores in the
Netherlands, seven stores in Belgium and one pilot store in Germany. HEMA’s turnover in Germany in
Fiscal 2003 was below expectations. This was caused by insufficient recognition of HEMA’s brand name
as well as its product assortment.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover in our HEMA business unit increased by A9 million, or 1.0%, from A924 million in
Fiscal 2001 to A933 million in Fiscal 2002. HEMA’s increase in net turnover in Fiscal 2002 compared to

70


-----

Fiscal 2001 was 2.9% on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001. Less than one-third of this increase related to
expansion of our store base. In Fiscal 2002, we opened five small stores in the Netherlands, three
stores in Belgium and two pilot stores in Germany. There was a substantial increase in like-for-like
sales in Belgium. Increases in like-for-like sales were generated by increases in most of HEMA’s
product groups, with women’s apparel, baby clothing, socks, and underwear particularly driving the
increase. Sales in the first three quarters of Fiscal 2002 were higher than in the same period in Fiscal
2001, but the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002 showed a small decline in turnover compared to the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2001 when sales were boosted by promotional activities relating to HEMA’s 75th
anniversary and its role in the distribution of euro kits.

_Segmental Operating Result_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Segmental operating result in our HEMA business unit decreased by A1 million from A8 million in
Half Year 2003 to A7 million in Half Year 2004. The gross operating result decreased due to lower likefor-like sales, which was partially compensated by a reduction in net operating expenses. Our gross
margin remained stable.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Segmental operating result in our HEMA business unit increased by A2 million, or 5.4%, from
A37 million in Fiscal 2002 to A39 million in Fiscal 2003. The segmental operating result of HEMA was
negatively impacted by start-up losses in Germany in Fiscal 2003; excluding these start-up losses the
segmental operating result of HEMA increased by approximately 14%. Improvements in gross margin
and logistic efficiency, combined with tight cost management, led to this increase in segmental
operating result.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Segmental operating result in our HEMA business unit increased by A5 million, or 15.6%, from
A32 million in Fiscal 2001 to A37 million in Fiscal 2002. The increase, which was proportionally greater
than the percentage increase in net turnover, reflected improvements in gross margin resulting from a
reduction in markdowns. The effect of these improvements more than compensated for general
inflationary pressures on operating expenses in Fiscal 2002.

_Net Turnover_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover in our Apparel business unit decreased by A8 million, or 3.3%, from A240 million in
Half Year 2003 to A232 million in Half Year 2004.

In all countries average prices at M&S have been adjusted downwards without any offset by
growth in the number of items sold which resulted in a significant decrease in like-for-like sales. On the
back of the negative turnover development the pace of expansion has been slowed down. Only 14 new
stores were opened in Half Year 2004 compared to 25 store openings in Half Year 2003.

Hunkem¨oller continued its expansion in Half Year 2004 with nine store openings and also
experienced a strong increase in like-for-like sales, especially in Denmark and Germany.

72


-----

Claudia Str¨ater recorded an increase of like-for-like sales despite the overall difficult market
conditions in the Benelux. In Germany, the pilot store of Claudia Str¨ater is performing satisfactorily
and we may therefore consider further expansion in this country.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

In Fiscal 2003 we changed the principles for recording and presenting turnover. As a result the
comparative figure for net turnover for Fiscal 2002 in our Apparel business unit has been adjusted
from A455 million, according to the former definition of recording and presenting turnover, to
A456 million, according to the new definition. Details of this change are described above under
‘‘—Results of Operations—Consolidated—Changes to the principles for recording and presenting
turnover.’’

Net turnover in our Apparel business unit increased by A1 million, or 0.2%, from A456 million in
Fiscal 2002 to A457 million in Fiscal 2003. In the first half year of Fiscal 2003 development in turnover
was positive with increases in net turnover of 7.8% and approximately 5.0% during the first and second
quarter, respectively. Net turnover in the third and fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 decreased by 6.1%
and 5.2%, respectively. While Hunkem¨oller and Claudia Str¨ater were able to show some recovery in
the fourth quarter from a weak third quarter, turnover at M&S continued to suffer. Compared to
Fiscal 2002, M&S and Claudia Str¨ater had a lower net turnover, while Hunkem¨oller increased net
turnover, in Fiscal 2003. The disappointing turnover developments were the result of difficult trading
conditions in the European apparel sector. During the second half of Fiscal 2003 consumer spending in
this sector was under significant pressure, especially in the Netherlands. M&S continued its rapid
expansion in Fiscal 2003, with 27 store openings in France and six store openings in Spain, while
Hunkem¨oller significantly expanded in Denmark with eight store openings and in France with seven
store openings.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover in our Apparel business unit increased by A31 million, or 7.3%, from A424 million in
Fiscal 2001 to A455 million in Fiscal 2002. Apparel’s increase in net turnover in Fiscal 2002 compared
to Fiscal 2001 was 9.4% on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001. All three units showed positive like-for-like
sales increases on top of the expanded store bases. Hunkem¨oller in particular experienced a high level
of growth, with significant like-for-like sales increases in all of the countries in which it operates in
addition to the opening of four new stores. M&S continued to increase its store base in France, adding
18 stores in Fiscal 2002, in addition to opening three stores in Germany and two pilot stores in Spain.
Claudia Str¨ater opened one new store in the Netherlands in Fiscal 2002.

_Segmental Operating Result_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Segmental operating result in our Apparel business unit decreased by A14 million, or 46.7%, from
A30 million in Half Year 2003 to A16 million in Half Year 2004. Segmental operating result of M&S in
Half Year 2004 included one-time charges of A2 million related to restructuring measures and an
impairment of fixed assets. Excluding these one-time costs, the segmental operating result in our
Apparel business unit decreased by A12 million, or 40.0%, from A30 million in Half Year 2003 to
A18 million in Half Year 2004. This significant decrease resulted entirely from negative developments at
M&S, including a decline in like-for-like sales growth, a decrease in gross operating margins and an
increase in net operating expenses. Hunkem¨oller realized an improvement in its segmental operating
result based on growth in net turnover and an improvement in gross operating margin. The segmental
operating result of Claudia Str¨ater was essentially unchanged.

73


-----

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Segmental operating result in our Apparel business unit decreased by A11 million, or 23.9%, from
A46 million in Fiscal 2002 to A35 million in Fiscal 2003. This significant decrease is almost entirely
attributable to M&S, which after a significant improvement in the first half, showed a strong decrease
in its segmental operating result in the second half of Fiscal 2003. Due to early clearance of the winter
collection, margins and segmental operating result decreased in the second half of Fiscal 2003, more
than offsetting the improvement in segmental operating result in the first half of the year. As a
consequence, the segmental operating result of M&S in Fiscal 2003 was significantly lower than the
segmental operating result in Fiscal 2002. Hunkem¨oller’s segmental operating result in Fiscal 2003
decreased slightly as higher turnover and a higher gross margin were offset by higher operating
expenses principally due to increased retail sales area. Claudia Str¨ater’s segmental operating result in
Fiscal 2003 was down due to a decline in gross operating result following a decrease in net turnover
and increased net operating expenses, principally due to increased retail sales area.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Segmental operating result in our Apparel business unit increased by A2 million, or 4.5%, from
A44 million in Fiscal 2001 to A46 million in Fiscal 2002. Hunkem¨oller showed a strong rebound in its
gross operating result in Fiscal 2002, with its gross margin more than fully recovering from the prior
year decline. Claudia Str¨ater continued to experience growth in its profitability, with gross margin
reaching an all-time high. M&S had a disappointing year in Fiscal 2002, which was attributable to
difficulties in the first half of Fiscal 2002, when poor weather conditions contributed to slow sales in
early spring, requiring significant mark downs in the late summer in order to clear merchandise. The
results of M&S were also negatively impacted by difficult trading conditions in Germany.

_Net Turnover_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover in our Bijenkorf business unit increased by A3 million, or 1.8%, from A167 million in
Half Year 2003 to A170 million in Half Year 2004. The increase in net turnover reflected expansion
resulting from the 2003 openings of the Maastricht store and the outlet store, offset by a decrease in
like-for-like sales due to store refurbishments in Amsterdam and Rotterdam as well as by the generally
weak economic conditions in non-food retail in the Netherlands during Half Year 2004.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

In Fiscal 2003 we changed the principles for recording and presenting turnover. As a result the
comparative figure for net turnover of Fiscal 2002 in our Bijenkorf business unit has been adjusted
from A420 million, according to the former definition of recording and presenting turnover, to
A389 million, according to the new definition. Details of this change are described above under

74


-----

‘‘—Results of Operations—Consolidated—Changes to the principles for recording and presenting
turnover.’’

Net turnover in our Bijenkorf business unit increased by A10 million, or 2.6%, from A389 million in
Fiscal 2002 to A399 million in Fiscal 2003. Net turnover in Fiscal 2003 was negatively influenced by the
disappointing sale of Christmas gifts by Bijenkorf Business Cadeau. Excluding this effect, net turnover
increased by 3.7%. This increase in net turnover was generated entirely from expansion (a medium
store in Enschede opened in September 2002, an outlet store in Lelystad was opened in May 2003, and
a new store in Maastricht opened in August 2003). Excluding expansion, net turnover was slightly
lower.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover in our Bijenkorf business unit increased by A14 million, or 3.4%, from A406 million in
Fiscal 2001 to A420 million in Fiscal 2002. Bijenkorf’s increase in net turnover in Fiscal 2002 compared
to Fiscal 2001 was 4.8% on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001. The increase in net turnover was generated
almost entirely from the increased number of stores in Fiscal 2002 (three stores opened in
September 2001 and a medium store opened in Enschede in September 2002). The economic downturn
in the Netherlands became more pronounced as Fiscal 2002 progressed. As a department store format
that is positioned in the upper and luxury segment of the market, and which generates approximately
80% of its net turnover from international brands, Bijenkorf suffered disproportionately from the sharp
decline in consumer confidence in Fiscal 2002 and sales could only be maintained by launching
marketing and price cutting campaigns at an early stage.

_Segmental Operating Result_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Segmental operating result in our Bijenkorf business unit decreased by A5 million, or 62.5%, from
a loss of A8 million in Half Year 2003 to a loss of A13 million in Half Year 2004. Segmental operating
result in Half Year 2004 included a restructuring charge of A3 million related to a cost savings program.
Excluding this restructuring charge, segmental operating result decreased by A2 million, or 25.0%, from
a loss of A8 million in Half Year 2003 to a loss of A10 million in Half Year 2004. As a result of seasonal
patterns, Bijenkorf’s segmental operating result is typically a loss during the first half of the year. The
decrease in segmental operating result was entirely attributable to increased net operating expenses due
to expansion, only partially offset by increased gross operating result from increased turnover.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Segmental operating result in our Bijenkorf business unit was essentially unchanged at A2 million
in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002. The segmental operating result in Fiscal 2003 was negatively influenced
by poor sales of Christmas gifts by Bijenkorf Business Cadeau but was positively influenced by cost
saving measures implemented in both the head office and the stores. In addition, the gross margin
improved in Fiscal 2003.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Segmental operating result in our Bijenkorf business unit decreased by A15 million, or 88.2%, from
A17 million in Fiscal 2001 to A2 million in Fiscal 2002. Segmental operating result as a percentage of
net turnover declined from 4.2% in Fiscal 2001 to 0.5% in Fiscal 2002. Part of this decline was due to
reduced margins in Fiscal 2002 resulting from increased markdowns and price promotions. The
remainder was caused by a decrease in net turnover that was only partially offset by decreased
operating expenses. Furthermore, Fiscal 2002 was only 52 weeks long compared to Fiscal 2001, which
was 53 weeks.

_Net Turnover_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover in our V&D business unit decreased by A52 million, or 13.6%, from A382 million in
Half Year 2003 to A330 million in Half Year 2004. We closed five stores at the beginning of Half Year
2004 as part of our restructuring plan. Excluding these store closures, net turnover still declined
significantly. Net turnover evolution in the second quarter of Half Year 2004 was slightly better than in
the first quarter, but like-for-like growth remained negative. Most non-food product groups contributed
to the negative sales trend. The food and restaurant business of V&D remains strong and was the best
performing product category.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

In Fiscal 2003 we changed the principles for recording and presenting turnover. As a result the
comparative figure for net turnover of Fiscal 2002 in our V&D business unit has been adjusted from
A856 million, according to the former definition of recording and presenting turnover, to A855 million
according to the new definition of recording and presenting turnover. Details of this change are
described above under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Consolidated—Changes to the principles for
recording and presenting turnover.’’

Net turnover in our V&D business unit decreased by A43 million, or 5.0%, from A855 million in
Fiscal 2002 to A812 million in Fiscal 2003. The decline in turnover started in April of Fiscal 2003 after
a successful ‘‘Price Circus’’ (which is an important promotional event for V&D). The revitalization
measures we adopted in Fiscal 2002 delivered insufficient results to stem the downward trend
experienced in earlier years. This trend was aggravated by the general slowdown of consumer
expenditure in non-food retail in the Netherlands compounded by lower sales in July as a result of
exceptionally hot weather conditions. In response to these negative results, we decided to change
management in July of Fiscal 2003. The new management team has worked on a comprehensive
package of measures designed to improve V&D’s results as described below under ‘‘Business—Our
V&D Operations—The V&D Restructuring.’’ As a result, management’s attention in the second half
year was primarily focused on the implementation of these far reaching measures to reduce costs.

76


-----

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover in our V&D business unit decreased by A34 million, or 3.8%, from A890 million in
Fiscal 2001 to A856 million in Fiscal 2002. V&D’s decrease in net turnover in Fiscal 2002 compared to
Fiscal 2001 was 2.0% on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001, despite the opening of one small store in the
first quarter of Fiscal 2002. The decrease in net turnover was the result of a failure to sufficiently
address the unit’s competitive weaknesses and was exacerbated by decreasing consumer confidence in
the Netherlands in Fiscal 2002. Net turnover declines were particularly notable in hard good categories
such as CDs, stationery and cosmetics.

In response to the negative sales developments during Fiscal 2001 and disappointing sales in the
first quarter of Fiscal 2002, we decided in April 2002 to launch a revitalization program. Core elements
of this program were a radical clearing out of old merchandise, which resulted in substantial
markdowns over the course of Fiscal 2002, a number of smaller scale cost saving initiatives, the launch
of an effort to make the merchandise mix more attractive (the effect of which was planned to be visible
in the stores commencing in the spring of 2003) and a number of initiatives to make our stores more
attractive. We also relaunched the Enschede and Maastricht stores with a modernized store design.

_Segmental Operating Result_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Segmental operating result in our V&D business unit improved by A11 million from an operating
loss of A35 million in Half Year 2003 to an operating loss of A24 million in Half Year 2004, reflecting
the success of the cost savings measures implemented under the V&D restructuring program. See
‘‘Business—Our V&D Operations—The V&D Restructuring.’’ In Half Year 2004 net operating
expenses were A26 million lower and gross margin was higher than in Half Year 2003, which was partly
offset by a decrease in gross operating result due to the negative turnover trend.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Segmental operating result in our V&D business unit declined by A60 million from an operating
loss of A59 million in Fiscal 2002 to an operating loss of A119 million in Fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003
included a restructuring charge of A80 million related to the comprehensive package of measures
designed to improve V&D’s performance. The most important measures of the restructuring plan
include cost savings, from, inter alia, a reduction of personnel by 1,800 FTE’s, the closure of 12 smaller
stores, the implementation of a new business control model, a reduction of capital expenditures, a
buying stop, and reduction of the number of suppliers in order to enhance buying power. The
restructuring charge of A80 million consisted of A60 million related to redundancies, A8 million related
to the write-down of fixed assets and A12 million related to other store closure costs (such as rental
liabilities and the restoration of stores to their original state). V&D’s segmental operating result in
Fiscal 2002 included a one-time charge of A48 million relating to the revitalization program. Out of this
charge, A25 million related to the write-off of inventories, of which A18 million was subsequently
withdrawn in Fiscal 2002 as a result of the improved inventory position. Excluding these one-time items
in both Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, segmental operating result at V&D declined by 34.5% to a loss of
A39 million in Fiscal 2003. The negative turnover trend led to a decreased gross operating result.
Although V&D made good progress in reducing net operating expenses as part of the restructuring
program, it was insufficient to compensate for the decline in gross operating result.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Segmental operating result in our V&D business unit decreased by A71 million from a positive
contribution of A12 million in Fiscal 2001 to a loss of A59 million in Fiscal 2002. The segmental
operating result in Fiscal 2002 was impacted by a one-time charge of A48 million relating to the

77


-----

revitalization program. The revitalization charge consisted of A25 million relating to the write-off of
inventories, A18 million relating to restructuring charges (principally headcount reductions at the V&D
head office) and A5 million for additional marketing efforts relating to inventory clearance activities.
The A25 million charge relating to inventories resulted from the implementation of stricter obsolescence
rules for merchandise that is not sold in-season. Full scale implementation of the clearance started in
April 2002 and lasted until January 2003 and resulted in a 20% decline in V&D’s inventory position as
well as a significantly improved age profile of year end inventories. Out of this A25 million charge
relating to inventories, A18 million was subsequently withdrawn in the course of Fiscal 2002 as a result
of the improved inventory position. The unreleased A7 million is not expected to be released in future
periods.

Excluding the one-time items, the decline in segmental operating result of A23 million, from
A12 million of operating profit in Fiscal 2001 to an operating loss of A11 million in Fiscal 2002, resulted
from the decline in turnover described above, inflationary pressures on operating expenses and a
decline in gross margin reflecting the need to take heavy markdowns to clear old merchandise.

_Net Turnover_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover in our Consumer Electronics business unit increased by A9 million, or 3.2%, from
A279 million in Half Year 2003 to A288 million in Half Year 2004. Both It’s and Modern Electronics
achieved increases in like-for-like sales despite the fact that they were operating in a very difficult
market environment in Half Year 2004. Both Dixons and Dynabyte recorded a decrease in like-for-like
sales, partly offset by growth from store additions (in total three new stores opened in Half Year 2004).
Some product categories, like digital audio and telecom, showed growth, while, in particular, PC
hardware turnover declined.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

In Fiscal 2003 we changed the principles for recording and presenting turnover. As a result the
comparative figure for net turnover of Fiscal 2002 in our Consumer Electronics business unit has been

78


-----

adjusted from A589 million, according to the former definition of recording and presenting turnover, to
A615 million, according to the new definition of recording and presenting turnover. Details of this
change are described above under ‘‘—Results of Operations—Consolidated—Changes to the principles
for recording and presenting turnover.’’

Net turnover in our Consumer Electronics business unit decreased by A12 million, or 2.0%, from
A615 million in Fiscal 2002 to A603 million in Fiscal 2003. Both Dixons and Dynabyte expanded their
store base, with six new stores opened by Dixons and three new stores opened by Dynabyte in Fiscal
2003. Dynabyte increased its like-for-like sales. Dixons benefited from strong growth in digital
photography and computer games, while Dynabyte benefited from increased demand for laptop
computers. It’s and Modern Electronics both recorded a significant decline in like-for-like sales. These
two businesses were operating in a very difficult market environment with increasing competitive
pressure in Fiscal 2003. The market decline reflects a consumer trend of trading down into lower
priced models. Due to the difficult market environment, the expansion of It’s and Modern Electronics
was limited. It’s opened only one store, while the store portfolio of Modern Electronics was further
reduced by two stores. Prijstopper increased the number of stores by two.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover in our Consumer Electronics business unit was essentially unchanged at A590 million
in Fiscal 2001 compared to A589 million in Fiscal 2002. However, net turnover in Consumer Electronics
in Fiscal 2002 compared to Fiscal 2001 increased by 1.7% on a 52-week basis for Fiscal 2001. As Fiscal
2002 progressed the effect of the economic downturn in the Netherlands was increasingly apparent at
all of Consumer Electronics’ formats. However, Dixons achieved a small increase in like-for-like sales
in addition to opening five new stores in Fiscal 2002. In particular, sales of computers at Dixons
increased in Fiscal 2002 after the Dutch consumer association designated Dixons’ own brand computer
as a ‘‘best buy.’’ Dynabyte opened three new stores in Fiscal 2002 but its net turnover was flat on a
like-for-like basis. Although Modern Electronics started Fiscal 2002 with severely depressed like-for-like
sales in the first quarter due to problems resulting from the integration of back office operations with
It’s, sales rebounded sharply later in the year. Modern Electronics’ like-for-like sales increased
substantially in the second half of Fiscal 2002 compared to the same period in Fiscal 2001 following our
restructuring of the format. The increase in Modern Electronics’ like-for-like sales was partially offset
by the closure of 17 smaller stores in Fiscal 2002. It’s experienced a small decrease in like-for-like sales,
which was partially offset by the opening of three new stores.

_Segmental Operating Result_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Segmental operating result in our Consumer Electronics business unit increased by A2 million from
A1 million in Half Year 2003 to A3 million in Half Year 2004. The increase in segmental operating
result in Half Year 2004 is entirely attributable to the increase in gross operating result from turnover
growth and decreased net operating expenses at It’s and Modern Electronics. The segmental operating
result of Dixons and Dynabyte was essentially unchanged.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Segmental operating result in our Consumer Electronics business unit decreased by A8 million, or
32.0%, from A25 million in Fiscal 2002 to A17 million in Fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 included a one-time
net gain of A7 million resulting from the termination of a contract for the distribution of mobile
telephones and the balance of income and expenditure connected with the restructuring of Modern
Electronics. Excluding this net gain, segmental operating result decreased by 5.6% from A18 million in
Fiscal 2002 to A17 million in Fiscal 2003. Excluding the above-mentioned net gain, the segmental

-----

operating result of Dixons and Dynabyte together remained essentially unchanged in Fiscal 2003.
Modern Electronics realized an improvement of the segmental operating result in Fiscal 2003 as a
result of the restructuring measures implemented in Fiscal 2002. The segmental operating result of It’s
decreased significantly following the decline in net turnover as described above.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Segmental operating result in our Consumer Electronics business unit increased by A11 million, or
78.6%, from A14 million in Fiscal 2001 to A25 million in Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 included a one-time
net gain of A7 million resulting from the termination of a contract for the distribution of mobile
telephones and the balance of income and expenditure connected with the restructuring of Modern
Electronics. Excluding this gain, segmental operating result increased by A4 million, or 28.6%, in Fiscal
2002. This increase primarily resulted from an improvement in gross margin at Modern Electronics and
It’s reflecting the benefit of the integration of the back offices of these two format that we commenced
in late Fiscal 2001.

**_Other_**

Other activities primarily consist of Schaap & Citroen, an up-market jewellery format, and
AudioSonic, a wholesaler consumer electronics trading company aimed at the low price segment of the
market. Other activities also include two internal shared service companies, Vendex KBB IT Services,
our internal IT company (which only reports operating result), and Vendex KBB Cards and Financial
Services, which is a unit we formed in Fiscal 2002, which distributes financial products (including store
credit cards). These internal shared service companies charge our business units for their services on a
negotiated basis.

Holding costs consist primarily of the costs incurred in our corporate head office, excluding
expenses incurred in relation to a number of centralized services, such as real estate services relating to
our leased stores, insurance and foreign exchange management, which are charged to the operating
companies and, as such, are directly included in their segmental operating results.

_Net Turnover_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net turnover from other activities increased by A7 million, or 41.2%, from A17 million in Half Year
2003 to A24 million in Half Year 2004. The increase resulted primarily from increased net turnover at
AudioSonic. Net turnover at Schaap & Citroen increased significantly as a result of sales promotions in
two stores which are to be closed. Excluding the effect of these sales promotions net turnover increased
only slightly.

80


-----

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Net turnover from other activities increased by A4 million, or 10.5%, from A38 million in Fiscal
2002 to A42 million in Fiscal 2003. The increase resulted from increased net turnover at AudioSonic as
increasingly poor macro economic conditions increased demand for keenly priced alternatives to
premium branded audio and video equipment. Net turnover at Schaap & Citroen declined in Fiscal
2003 as a result of depressed market conditions and the collapse of international tourism, which
especially affected our two Schaap & Citroen stores in Amsterdam.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net turnover from other activities declined by A9 million, or 19.1%, from A47 million in Fiscal 2001
to A38 million in Fiscal 2002. The decline resulted primarily from significantly reduced net turnover at
Schaap & Citroen reflecting declining consumer confidence in the Netherlands. Net turnover at
AudioSonic also declined as it continued to focus only on profitable business.

_Segmental Operating Result_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Segmental operating result from other activities increased by A4 million from an operating loss of
A2 million in Half Year 2003 to an operating profit of A2 million in Half Year 2004. AudioSonic’s
segmental operating result increased significantly in Half Year 2004 as a result of increased sales, partly
offset by a lower gross margin resulting from lower selling prices. Despite a lower gross operating
margin resulting from increased mark downs in the two stores to be closed, Schaap & Citroen managed
to reduce the operating loss through increased net turnover and tight cost control. The contribution to
segmental operating result of Vendex KBB IT Services increased significantly as a result of tight cost
control and increased productivity. As a start up business Vendex KBB Cards and Financial Services
recorded an increased loss resulting primarily from lagging sales.

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003 Holding Costs_

Holding costs increased by A23 million from A6 million in Half Year 2003 to A29 million in Half
Year 2004. Holding costs in Half Year 2004 included one-time costs of A22 million, consisting of costs
related to management stock options and merger and acquisition advisory costs, which related to the
Acquisition and one-time costs of A2 million related to special projects. Excluding these one-time costs,
holding costs decreased by A1 million.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Segmental operating result from other activities improved from an operating loss of A9 million in
Fiscal 2002 to an operating loss of A1 million in Fiscal 2003. Schaap & Citroen recorded an increased
operating loss due to depressed sales in Fiscal 2003. AudioSonic’s segmental operating result more than
doubled compared to the segmental operating result of Fiscal 2002 as a result of increased sales.
Vendex KBB IT Services recorded a break-even segmental operating result in Fiscal 2003 compared to
a loss in Fiscal 2002 as a result of both the restructuring that occurred in Fiscal 2002 and increased
services demand from group companies. Vendex KBB Cards and Financial Services recorded an
increased loss resulting primarily from the inclusion of 100% of ‘‘Vendopolis,’’ an insurance agent that
operates in V&D stores and which had previously been operated and accounted for as a joint venture
between an insurance company and Vendex KBB.

Holding costs decreased by A4 million, from A22 million in Fiscal 2002 to A18 million in Fiscal
2003. Holding costs in Fiscal 2003 included a one-time aggregate charge of A5 million essentially
related to the termination of a contract with an insurance company. Holding costs in Fiscal 2002

81


-----

included a one-time charge of A15 million taken in connection with the restructuring of our central IT
operations, including a loss on the disposal of our Sittard IT location. Excluding these one-time
charges, holding costs increased by A6 million, from A7 million in Fiscal 2002 to A13 million in Fiscal
2003.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Segmental operating result from other activities declined by A10 million from an operating profit of
A1 million in Fiscal 2001 to an operating loss of A9 million in Fiscal 2002. Schaap & Citroen recorded
an operating loss in Fiscal 2002 compared to a small contribution to segmental operating result in
Fiscal 2001 as a result of the decline in net turnover. AudioSonic recorded a reduced segmental
operating result compared to its relatively high level in fiscal 2001. The loss at Vendex KBB IT Services
increased in Fiscal 2002 compared to Fiscal 2001. Having completed the conversion to the euro, all
group operating companies reduced IT expenditure in Fiscal 2002, leading to surplus capacity. In
addition, the management, appointed in the second half of Fiscal 2001, carried out a cost saving
exercise, which led to a number of charges taken in Fiscal 2002. Vendex KBB Cards and Financial
Services reported a small loss as a result of start up costs.

Holding costs in Fiscal 2002 were significantly higher than in Fiscal 2001 but included a one-time
charge of A15 million taken in connection with the restructuring of our central IT operations, including
a loss on the disposal of our Sittard IT location. Excluding this one-time charge, holding costs
decreased slightly.

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Cash flow from continued operations decreased by A7 million, or 8.0%, from A87 million in Half
Year 2003 to A80 million in Half Year 2004. This decrease was due to a lower operating result and
increased cash outflow related to operating provisions (primarily V&D), partly offset by reduced cash
outflow related to investment in working capital. The cash outflow related to working capital decreased
from A31 million in Half Year 2003 to A1 million in Half Year 2004, principally due to better
management of our payables.

83


-----

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Cash flow from continued operations decreased by A78 million from A320 million in Fiscal 2002 to
A242 million in Fiscal 2003. This decrease was largely due to a decrease in operating result of
A78 million and an investment in working capital of A20 million in Fiscal 2003 as compared to a
reduction in working capital of A51 million in Fiscal 2002. This decrease was partly offset by increased
depreciation and by an increase in operating provisions of A25 million in Fiscal 2003, predominantly
related to part of the restructuring charges of V&D described above under ‘‘—Results of Operations—
Segmental—V&D’’ not being paid in Fiscal 2003 compared to a decline in operating provisions of
A20 million in Fiscal 2002, primarily related to cash outflows regarding discontinued activities.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Cash flow from continued operations increased by A56 million from A264 million in Fiscal 2001 to
A320 million in Fiscal 2002 primarily as the result of working capital improvements. Working capital
decreased by A51 million in Fiscal 2002 due to substantially lower inventories in most business units,
particularly at V&D, HEMA and Apparel. Operating result from continued activities decreased from
A220 million in Fiscal 2001 to A142 million in Fiscal 2002. This decrease reflected charges of
A48 million taken in connection with V&D’s revitalisation and A15 million taken in connection with the
IT restructuring in Fiscal 2002, a portion of which were non-cash.

_Cash Flow from Investment Activities_

_Half Year 2004 Compared to Half Year 2003_

Net investments in intangible fixed assets and tangible fixed assets decreased by A28 million from
A99 million in Half Year 2003 to A71 million in Half Year 2004. The decrease in net investment in Half
Year 2004 reflected the decision to significantly reduce the capital expenditures at V&D. See
‘‘Business—Our V&D Operations—The V&D Restructuring.’’ Capital expenditures at Apparel in Half
Year 2004 were lower than in Half Year 2003 due to a lower pace of expansion. These reductions in
net investments were partly offset by increased capital expenditure at Bijenkorf caused by remodeling
the Amsterdam store, and the inclusion of the capital expenditure related to the seven Belgian
megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin and Castorama for the entire period in Half Year 2004
compared to the inclusion of the six Leroy Merlin DIY stores for approximately one month in 2003 in
DIY. Capital expenditures at HEMA and Consumer Electronics were essentially unchanged.

Our cash outflows related to acquisitions (net investments in group companies) reduced from
A82 million in Half Year 2003 to A1 million in Half Year 2004.

84


-----

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Net investments in intangible fixed assets and tangible fixed assets from continued activities
increased by A20 million from A173 million in Fiscal 2002 to A193 million in Fiscal 2003. The principal
increases in capital expenditure were at Apparel, primarily due to Hunkem¨oller’s expansion in
Denmark and France, the expansion of M&S in France and Spain and the reformatting of ten M&S
stores; at HEMA, primarily resulting from its expansion in Belgium; at Bijenkorf, due to the new store
in Maastricht and the investments in the Amsterdam flagship store; and at DIY. Capital expenditure
decreased at V&D, reflecting the decision to delay store upgrades, and at Consumer Electronics.

We spent a net amount of A81 million on acquisitions in Fiscal 2003, principally in DIY in
connection with the six Belgian megastores we acquired from Leroy Merlin (including the indebtedness
we assumed) in Half Year 2003 and the Belgian Castorama store we acquired in August 2003. The
acquisitions were funded with borrowings under our existing credit facilities.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Net investments in intangible fixed assets and tangible fixed assets from continued activities
decreased by A3 million from A176 million in Fiscal 2001 to A173 million in Fiscal 2002. Net investment
in Fiscal 2002 reflects increased capital expenditure of A8 million at DIY, due to the inclusion of Brico
in our DIY portfolio, and A7 million at V&D, resulting primarily from store upgrades. Capital
expenditure decreased by A8 million at HEMA, reflecting the completion of its new distribution center,
the majority of the spending for which occurred in Fiscal 2001, A6 million at Apparel, although its level
of capital expenditure still remained well in excess of its depreciation, and A4 million at Bijenkorf.

We spent A148 million on the acquisition of Brico in Fiscal 2002 (including the indebtedness we
assumed), which we funded with borrowings under our then-existing credit facilities. We received
A300 million in Fiscal 2002 in connection with the Packaged Sale (excluding indebtedness).

_Net Cash Flow from Financing Activities_

The following table sets forth the principal components of Vendex KBB’s net cash flow from
financing activities for the periods indicated.

_Half Year 2004 to Half Year 2003_

Our net cash inflow from financing activities increased by A97 million from A23 million in Half
Year 2003 to A120 million in Half Year 2004. This increase primarily resulted from new financing
arrangements in relation to the Acquisition. In addition, no dividend was paid in Half Year 2004
compared to A29 million in Half Year 2003.

_2003 Compared to 2002_

Our cash flow from financing activities increased by A336 million from a cash outflow of
A204 million in Fiscal 2002 to a cash inflow of A132 million in Fiscal 2003. This resulted primarily from

85


-----

new financing arrangements in connection with the refinancing of most of our outstanding indebtedness
in November 2003 in which the largest part of our short-term liabilities were converted into long-term
financing committments. In addition, the cash outflow related to repurchases of our own shares was
significantly reduced from an outflow of A19 million in Fiscal 2002 to an outflow of A1 million in Fiscal
2003.

_2002 Compared to 2001_

Our net cash outflow from financing activities increased by A96 million from A108 million in Fiscal
2001 to A204 million for Fiscal 2002. This increase primarily resulted from early repayment of various
loans with part of the proceeds from the Packaged Sale, partly offset by a reduction of the number of
our own shares repurchased by us and a reduction of dividend payments.

**_Liquidity_**

Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flows, which are analyzed above. Our ability
to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn
dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled
‘‘Risk Factors.’’

We have a committed Revolving Credit Facility of A265 million to service our working capital
needs and other various corporate purposes. The availability of this Revolving Credit Facility is
dependent upon conditions described under ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Senior Credit
Facilities.’’

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available
borrowings and cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service
needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or
that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay
our debts when due, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity are:

  - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of net income from our operations, which
could be caused by a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole;

  - a failure to reduce working capital and improve the management of our supply-chain and
sourcing;

  - the need to fund restructuring costs of our V&D business unit; and

   - the need to fund additional capital expenditures associated with our expansion plans, in
particular with respect to our DIY, HEMA and Apparel business units.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under
the Senior Credit Facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our
liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity.

-----

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely
basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the notes
and the Senior Credit Facilities, and any future debt, may limit our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives.

We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of August 1, 2004, and as
adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing, we would have had approximately A1,554.9 million of
indebtedness, of which A625 million was indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and
A275 million was represented by the notes. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue for the
foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may have important negative consequences for you. For
more information, see the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the
Guarantees.’’

_Senior Credit Facilities_

The Senior Credit Facilities require us to meet certain financial tests, including:

  - minimum net cash interest coverage ratio (defined as Consolidated EBITDA to Net Cash
Interest);

  - a maximum total leverage ratio (defined as Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA);

  - a maximum senior leverage ratio (defined as Senior Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA);

  - a minimum debt service cover ratio (defined as Cashflow to Total Debt Service); and

   - a limitation on total capital expenditures

(in each case, as such terms are defined in the Senior Credit Facilities). The calculation of EBITDA
under our Senior Credit Facilities is different from the calculation of EBITDA presented in this
offering memorandum. For more information, please see ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Senior
Credit Facilities.’’

Our Senior Credit Facilities also contain affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions
on additional indebtedness, dividend payments, intercompany and other loans and investments, capital
expenditures, asset sales, liens and pledges, transactions with affiliates, and amendments to charter
documents and material agreements. Our Senior Credit Facilities also contain certain events of default,
and defaults resulting from certain events affecting the business and assets of the lender of record, that
may result in the acceleration of the debt under the Senior Credit Facilities. Please see the section
entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Senior Credit Facilities.’’

**_Working Capital Requirements_**

The following table sets forth the principal components of our working capital for the periods
indicated.

and market trends. We intend to reduce our working capital by renegotiating payment terms with our
suppliers and by improving our inventory management through investment in automation and IT.

The seasonal aspects of our operations have a significant impact on our working capital levels. As

To ensure that we have adequate liquidity for our working capital requirements in the future, the
Senior Credit Facilities include the Revolving Credit Facility which provides us with additional liquidity.
See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness.’’

**_Capital Expenditure_**

We expect capital expenditures in Fiscal 2004 to be in line with our depreciation expense and to be
funded through our operating cash flows. In Fiscal 2005, capital expenditures are expected to be at a
level moderately above our depreciation expense and to be funded through operating cash flow.

A large part of our capital expenditures represents discretionary investment in store
refurbishments, expansions, and openings, that we are therefore able to defer, if necessary, to provide
greater financial flexibility through the economic cycle.

**_Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities_**

The following table summarizes the contractual obligations and principal payments we were
obligated to make as of August 1, 2004 under our debt instruments, capital and operating leases and
other agreements on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Refinancing. The information
presented in the table below reflects management’s estimates of the contractual maturities of our
obligations. These maturities may differ significantly from the actual maturity of these obligations.

_Pensions_

As of February 1, 2004, the number of policyholders under Vendex KBB’s main pension fund, was
approximately 87,000, consisting of approximately 32,000 active members, 40,000 paid-up members, and
15,000 retired members. The funding of the scheme is determined by a finance agreement between
Vendex KBB and the pension fund, and should at least cover the actual annual costs of pension’s
accrual and administration. The funding itself is provided by contributions made by both Vendex KBB
and the covered employee and is determined as a percentage of the relevant employee’s wages, after
deducting a hurdle amount which is revised annually. The division of the contribution between Vendex
KBB and the employee is set out in a collective labor agreement.

The coverage funding ratios of pension plans throughout the Netherlands, including Vendex
KBB’s, have been adversely affected by recently volatile and declining equity markets. Vendex KBB’s
main pension fund, Stichting Pensioenfonds Vendex KBB, had a coverage funding ratio of 103% of its
pension obligations as of February 1, 2004. Pursuant to a recovery plan, approved by the Dutch pension
regulator (Pensioen & Verzekeringskamer), Vendex KBB is required to raise this coverage funding ratio
to 126% by 2014. To achieve this goal, Vendex KBB has increased its total cash contributions from
12.6% in 2001 to 15.0% in 2002 and to 17.6% in 2003 of the total wages for the main pension plan
(after applying a non pensionable salary amount currently set at A16,543 per employee) and from 3%
to 4% in 2003 of the total wages for the early retirement pension plan. In addition, as of January 1,
2004, Vendex KBB raised the early retirement age from 62 to 63. If despite these additional
contributions the pension fund’s funding levels fail to improve, Vendex KBB may have to negotiate
additional changes to its pension plan with the trade unions and may need to obtain further approvals
from the Dutch pension regulator. Possible changes thereto could include a one-time cash injection into
the fund, an increase in Vendex KBB’s ongoing cash contributions, an increase in the employees’ cash
contributions, a suspension or reduction of future indexation or, in extreme cases, a reduction of
benefits. If Vendex KBB were required to increase its cash contribution into the pension scheme, either
as a one-time injection or on an ongoing basis, such payments could negatively impact our ability to
conduct our operations and service our debt obligations, including the notes.

_Contingent Liabilities_

Vendex KBB is a party to certain legal proceedings. The two most significant pending lawsuits
involve (i) claims by former employees for additional pension benefits and (ii) claims arising from the
merger of Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB. Based on available
information, we do not believe the employees’ claim, in which the employees have launched an appeal
after receiving a verdict which was only partially successful for them, will have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The second claim, which we
have disputed, seeks damages of approximately A8 million plus interest and legal costs. These claims, as
well as other claims to which we are or may become subject, could, if adversely determined or settled,
result in cash outflows which would need to be funded from our sources of liquidity. See ‘‘Business—
Legal Proceedings’’.

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

In the course of our business we provide repurchase commitments with respect to unsold
merchandise to certain franchisees and affiliated companies. We also provide guarantees to third party
suppliers on behalf of certain franchisees and affiliated companies. We had contingent liabilities in
respect of these repurchase commitments and guarantees totaling A39 million as at August 1, 2004. In
addition, we have contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees issued to various suppliers on behalf of
several subsidiaries totaling A41 million as at August 1, 2004.

**_Affiliate Transactions_**

VDXK has entered into an advisory services agreement with the Sponsors, whereby the Sponsors
provide ongoing consulting and management advisory services to us for an aggregate periodic annual
fee of A2 million plus 5% of the aggregate fee paid in the preceding year.

A description of this advisory services agreement and certain other transactions involving us and
certain of our affiliates, including the Consortium, is set out in this offering memorandum under
‘‘Certain Relations and Related Party Transactions.’’

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

We purchase a substantial part of our products in euro from our suppliers. For our remaining
purchases, a substantial part of which are denominated in United States or Hong Kong dollars, we
purchase hedging contracts to reduce exposure to currency fluctuations. As these hedging contracts are
based on underlying purchase contracts, we believe they do not have a material impact on our
operations and financial position.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are exposed to variable interest rates from our Senior Credit Facilities, the retained
indebtedness and the Floating Rate Notes. We have entered into interest rate swaps to manage our
interest rate exposure for a notional amount of approximately A250 million expiring in January 2005
and A275 million expiring in July 2007. We have also entered into interest rate swaps to manage our
interest rate exposure on the Mortgage Loan for an aggregate notional amount of A450 million expiring
in July 2009. The remaining principle amount of the Mortgage Loan of A150 million is covered by an
interest rate cap expiring in July 2009. We may enter into additional interest rate swap arrangements
with respect to our floating rate debt.

**_Impact of Inflation_**

In general, our costs are affected by inflation. We attempt to restrict increases in our costs below
the rate of inflation through productivity improvements and capital expenditure. However, general
inflation affects selling, general and administrative and similar costs for our competitors and us.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our reported results of operations and financial condition reflect the accounting policies,
assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of our financial statements. Accordingly our
accounting policies and the related assumptions and estimates are factors to be considered when
reviewing both the discussion below and our financial statements. Our results and financial condition
could differ from those discussed below if we were to apply different accounting policies, assumptions
and estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies, which are those that we
consider to be most important to the portrayal of our financial results and condition or require
management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

**_Purchase accounting and goodwill_**

Goodwill reflects the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the acquired assets
and liabilities, including intangible assets, recorded in connection with acquisitions. Accounting for
goodwill and acquired intangible assets requires management’s estimate regarding (1) the fair value of

90


-----

the acquired intangible assets and the initial amount of goodwill to be recorded, (2) the amortization
period and (3) the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets.

Goodwill acquired in connection with acquisitions is capitalized and amortized over the period
during which future economic benefits are expected to be generated. There is a rebuttable presumption
that the amortization period does not exceed a maximum period of 20 years.

To determine the initial amount of goodwill to be recorded upon acquisition, we have to determine
the consideration and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. We use independent
appraisers and our internal analysis, generally based on discounted cash flow techniques, to determine
the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and non-cash components of the consideration paid.
The actual fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired could differ from the fair value determined,
resulting in an under- or over-statement of goodwill. Factors that are considered in estimating the
useful life of goodwill include the foreseeable life of the business or industry and other.

The amortization period is reviewed annually in light of the above factors for goodwill. Goodwill is
tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances so require. The amortization period is
reviewed annually in light of the above factors for goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment when
events or circumstances (triggering events) indicate that goodwill may be impaired. If there is an
indication that goodwill may be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest
cash-generating unit to which the goodwill can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis. This
amount is then compared to the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (including allocated
goodwill) and any shortfall is recognized as an impairment loss (‘‘bottom-up’’ test). If it is not possible
to allocate goodwill on a reasonable and consistent basis to separate cash-generating units, an
additional ‘‘top-down’’ test is carried out under which the unallocated amount of goodwill is allocated
to a ‘‘larger’’ cash-generating unit; the recoverable amount of the ‘‘larger’’ cash-generating unit
(including goodwill) is then compared to its carrying amount and any shortfall is recognized as an
impairment loss. The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is often determined using discounted
future cash flows, involving significant assumptions made by management. These include the
determination of the appropriate discount rate, projected sales and operating income and non-cash
items such as depreciation, amortization and changes in working capital. In making these assumptions,
we consider historical results, adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Because
a change in these assumptions can result in a significant change in the recorded amount of goodwill, we
believe the accounting for goodwill is one of our critical accounting policies.

**_Valuation of Stock_**

We record our stock at the average purchase price less a provision for obsolescence, deterioration
and other risks of holding stocks. In the average purchase price we include costs directly related to the
purchase, such as shipping and insurance costs. Depending on the measures most appropriate for
different businesses, the method for calculating provisions for obsolescence differs between the
operating companies. They are consistently applied from one period to another. In general the guiding
principle is to use a method which ensures that a margin impact is reported in the period where
merchandise is left unsold or marked down, rather than leaving the margin impact to occur when
overdue merchandise is sold. A change in those estimates in a subsequent period may result in a
further write down of stocks.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Turnover represents the value of the goods and services sold and is recorded at the moment of
delivery, net of VAT and sales discounts. Sales discounts include the estimated cost of both general and
customer loyalty programs. These programs allow the customer to exercise points in exchange for
products or services. In determining the estimated sales discount to record, management is required to

91


-----

estimate the anticipated levels of redemption and average cost per point. These estimates are based on
third party reports and internal analysis derived from historical experience.

**_Income Taxes_**

We operate in numerous countries where our income tax returns are subject to audits and
adjustments. Because we operate in multiple countries, the nature of the audit items are often very
complex, and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more
than one country.

We also have deferred assets resulting primarily from net operating losses. The realization of these
assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future.
Management has exercised judgment in determining the extent of the realization of these losses based
upon estimates of future taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which these deferred tax
assets exist. These deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that realization thereof is considered
probable. If actual events differ from management’s estimates, or, to the extent that these estimates are
adjusted in the future, any changes to the amount of deferred tax assets recognized could materially
impact our financial position and results of operations.

**_Litigations and settlements_**

We are party to a number of legal proceedings, most of which are routine and all of which are
incidental to our business. Some matters involve claims for large amounts of damages as well as other
relief. We form a provision when we consider it probable that there will be an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits to settle that claim. We note, however, that the probable outcome of
legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to assess.

**_Pension benefits_**

We maintain a number of benefit plans for our employees, including defined benefit pension plans.
Historically, Vendex KBB did not record a liability for the implied difference between the estimated
defined benefit obligation, and plan assets based on Dutch GAAP. The issuer applies an alternate
accounting allowed under Dutch GAAP and accordingly has recorded this liability. The calculation of
the pension liability requires the use of a number of estimates and assumptions. Significant benefit plan
assumptions include the discount rate, the long-term rate of return of plan assets and rate of future
increases in compensation. The assumptions we use are based on historical experience and by
evaluating predictions on matters such as rates of return and mortality provided by third party advisors
such as actuaries and investment advisors. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense
and liability amounts, and future actual expense can materially differ from the assumptions.

**BUSINESS**

**Our Group**

We are the leading non-food retailer in the Netherlands with an estimated 8% overall market
share and with expanding operations in Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain.
We were created in 1999 through the merger of two of the oldest and largest retail groups in the
Netherlands, Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB, which were
founded respectively in 1887 and 1870. We are organized into six main business units DIY; HEMA
(variety store); Apparel; Bijenkorf and V&D (both department stores); and Consumer Electronics. In
addition, we also operate a number of smaller retail-related and service businesses. Our business units
comprise a total of 15 retail formats, which we believe represents a diversified portfolio of
well-established brands, many of which are household names in the Netherlands.

We operate 1,785 stores, both directly and through franchises, representing approximately two
million square meters of net retail space. We estimate that, in the Netherlands alone, our retail formats
collectively receive an average of eight million visitors per week.

**Our History**

We were created in 1999 through the merger of two of the oldest and largest retail groups in the
Netherlands, Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB. Vendex
International N.V. traces its origins to the V&D department store business, which was founded in
Amsterdam in 1887. N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB was founded in 1919, although it traces its
origins to the Bijenkorf department store chain founded in Amsterdam in 1870.

Following the merger, our portfolio of businesses consisted of 26 separate retail formats. Given the
complexity of running such an extensive and diverse group of businesses, our management has pursued
a strategy of reducing our total number of retail formats by selling or liquidating 16 retail formats since
1999 that have under-performed relative to our expectations or which we believed lacked the potential
for European expansion under our management. In particular, in Fiscal 2001, we sold the US toy chain,
FAO Schwarz in an asset sale. In Fiscal 2002, in the Packaged Sale, we disposed of Hans Anders (an
opticians group with three retail formats in the Netherlands and Belgium), Siebel Jewellers (a jewellery
group with four retail formats in the Netherlands, three of which we sold while keeping the fourth,
Schaap & Citroen), Kijkshop (a showcase retailer operating in the Netherlands and Belgium), Perry
Sport (a retailer of sportswear and sporting articles in the Netherlands), Scapino (a footwear retailer
operating in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany) and Pr´enatal (a baby and maternity apparel
retailer in the Netherlands). Subsequently, we disposed of our IT location in Sittard in the Netherlands,
which had primarily serviced the businesses sold in the Packaged Sale. In addition, in Fiscal 2002 we
closed down Dixtone (a mobile phone retailer), and sold America Today (a fashion retail chain
operating in the Netherlands and Belgium).

Since the completion of the merger, we have also actively pursued the development and expansion
of a selected number of our retail formats both through the opening of new stores as well as the
acquisition of whole businesses or groups of stores. In a number of cases, this has taken the group into
new geographical markets within Europe.

Our Apparel business unit has grown predominantly by organic expansion. M&S grew rapidly in
France, adding a total of 60 stores since the beginning of Fiscal 2001 through the end of Half Year
2004. In Fiscal 2002, we opened two pilot M&S stores in Spain. Following the success of the pilot
program, we decided to continue the expansion and have opened an additional seven stores in Spain
through Half Year 2004. Hunkem¨oller significantly expanded its operations in Denmark by opening a
further eight stores since the beginning of Fiscal 2001 through the end of Half Year 2004 and, following
the success of its pilot program, opened a further eight stores in France in the same period. In addition

93


-----

to expanding into new markets, Hunkem¨oller opened a further eight stores in the Netherlands and four
stores in Germany during the same period.

Our HEMA business unit has also expanded both in the Netherlands and in other countries. Since
Fiscal 2001, HEMA opened 16 stores in the Netherlands, 15 stores in Belgium and three pilot stores in
Germany.

In Fiscal 2002, we acquired the Belgian DIY operations of Brico, the market leader in Belgium,
which took us into the Belgian market with 97 stores that we continue to operate under the Brico retail
format. In addition, we acquired seven megastores in Belgium from Leroy Merlin and Castorama
effective July and August 2003, respectively.

In 2004, we were acquired by the Consortium and our common and preferred shares were delisted
from Euronext Amsterdam. See ‘‘The Acquisition, the Property Transaction and Related Transactions—
The Acquisition.’’

**Our Strengths**

**_Leading Market Position in Attractive and Stable Markets_**

We are the leading non-food retailer in the Netherlands. We estimate our overall market share of
the highly fragmented Dutch non-food retail market at 8%. We are the leading player in the do-ityourself market in the Benelux, being the market leader in Belgium (with an estimated market share of
20%) and having a strong number two position in the Netherlands (with an estimated market share of
24%). Our HEMA store chain is the largest general merchandiser in the Netherlands, and our
Bijenkorf and V&D department store retail formats are the only national department store chains
operating in the Dutch market. Our Apparel formats have strong, well differentiated positions in their
respective niche markets, and, including Bijenkorf and V&D, we are, as a group, the largest apparel
retailer in the Netherlands. We believe our Consumer Electronics business unit is among the leading
consumer electronics retailers in the Netherlands.

Our size enables us to negotiate prices from our suppliers that are lower than those offered to our
local competitors, facilitates the negotiation of better rental terms, improves our access to prime real
estate locations and gives us the scale necessary to realize cost efficiencies in marketing and central
administration.

In addition, we believe that the non-food retail market is relatively more stable in the Netherlands
than in many other countries due to regulatory restrictions on out-of-town building developments, space
limitations, and a customer preference for city center shopping. We believe that the stability of the
market structure has historically favored existing non-food retailers, such as ourselves, over new
entrants.

**_Highly Recognized Brand Names and Well Established Franchises_**

We believe that our brands are well established in the Netherlands and benefit from strong market
positions with many years of continuous operations. Bijenkorf and V&D have been active department
store chains for over 100 years, HEMA has operated in the Netherlands for more than 75 years, and
Hunkem¨oller for more than 120 years. Today, our portfolio includes some of the most popular brands
in the Netherlands. For example, HEMA was elected the best retail store in the Netherlands in 2003
(Elsevier Retail Survey) for the second consecutive year and Hunkem¨oller won the Mastercard Retailer
of the Year award in 2003. We believe that the established franchises and nearly universal recognition
in the Netherlands of our various brand names help to drive a high foot traffic in our stores and
represent a significant competitive advantage.

94


-----

**_Large Store Portfolio in Prime Locations_**

We operate directly or through franchises a portfolio of 1,785 stores in the Netherlands (1,168),
Belgium (289), France (153), Germany (137), Denmark (19), Luxembourg (10) and Spain (9),
representing a net selling space of approximately two million square meters. Our store portfolio is
unique in the Netherlands, as a significant portion of our stores are located in prime retail locations, in
town centers, along high streets and in major shopping districts. This results in very high foot traffic in
our stores. We estimate that in the Netherlands, which has a population of 16.3 million, we receive
approximately 8 million visitors per week. We believe that the quality and size of our store portfolio
represent a significant competitive advantage, given the limited availability of high quality retail
locations in the Netherlands. In addition, we believe that our size and the fact that HEMA, Bijenkorf
and V&D often serve as anchor tenants in their respective locations make us an attractive tenant to
landlords and provide substantial leverage in negotiating and securing current and future rental
agreements.

**_Diversified Business Portfolio_**

We are organized into six main business units and operate across three retail categories through a
total of 15 retail formats. Our portfolio of retail formats offers customers a diversified range of
products and brands that appeal to a broad spectrum of consumer market segments. We sell products
that range from do-it-yourself to apparel to electronics and include both branded and private label
products. Our 15 different retail formats target consumers in the value, middle-market and up-market
segments. For example, HEMA’s products typically appeal to value conscious consumers, while V&D
and Bijenkorf primarily target the middle-market and up-market customers, respectively. While still
geographically concentrated in the Netherlands, we have an increasing presence outside the
Netherlands (with 18% of our turnover generated outside the Netherlands in Fiscal 2003). We believe
that the diversity of our business portfolio across different market segments and customer spending
categories reduces the sensitivity of our business to economic downturns and our exposure to adverse
developments in any single product or consumer market segment.

**_Stable Margins and Cash Flows in our Most Significant Business Units and Adjustable Capital Expenditures_**

We benefit from relatively stable cash flows, due mainly to consistent EBITDA generation in our
most significant business units and predictable and adjustable capital expenditure throughout the group.
Despite the recent economic downturn in the Netherlands, one of the most significant in the last
20 years, DIY and HEMA, our two largest EBITDA generators, maintained relatively stable margins.

We have invested A616 million in our business over the past three years which represents 147% of
our depreciation charges during that same period. A large part of our capital expenditures represents
discretionary investments in store refurbishments, expansions and openings, that we are therefore able
to defer, if necessary, to provide greater financial flexibility through the economic cycle.

**_Experienced and Incentivized Management Team_**

Our Board of Management and the head of each business unit have an average of 21 years of
experience in retail. We believe that the depth of experience of our operational management teams,
gained across different retail segments, provides us with an advantage over smaller competitors,
allowing us to exchange knowledge of best practices and deploy members of our operational
management teams across business units. Our Board of Management, together with approximately 50
other managers, have made a significant equity investment in the group, and have been granted an
incentive package with a strong focus on increasing profitability and cash generation.

95

**_Principal Shareholders with Significant Retail Sector Experience_**

We expect to benefit from the relationships, investment experience, retail expertise and Dutch
market knowledge of our sponsors, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (‘‘KKR’’), Cinven Limited
(‘‘Cinven’’), Permira Advisers Limited (and other entities which act as advisers or consultants to
Permira funds, ‘‘Permira’’) and AlpInvest Partners N.V. (‘‘AlpInvest’’ and together with KKR, Cinven
and Permira, the ‘‘Sponsors’’).

Our Sponsors are some of the world’s leading and most experienced private equity firms and have
a significant track record of successful investments in the retail industry. Our Sponsors’ investments in
the retail industry have included Safeway, Stop & Shop, Fred Meyer, Randall’s Food Markets, Peacock
and Allied Carpets.

**Our Strategy**

The following identifies some of the key elements of our strategy.

**_Improve Operations within the Group_**

Under new ownership, our key priority is to improve the performance of all our business units in
order to increase our profitability and to improve our cash flow generation.

To achieve this goal, each of our DIY, HEMA, Apparel, Bijenkorf and V&D business units, with
the support of specialized consultants, has conducted over the last three months a comprehensive
review of their operations, including for each of their formats an assessment of each significant cost
and working capital component. As a result of this review, we have identified across these business
units significant cost savings opportunities and working capital improvements that we expect to be able
to achieve over the next three years.

We have identified cost savings opportunities that may be realized through (i) the optimization of
our head-office functions both in our business units and at corporate level, (ii) the improvement of
efficiency in our stores, (iii) productivity gains in our logistics and back office operations through the
optimization of our warehouse facilities (particularly in Bijenkorf and Apparel) and additional
investments in IT and automation, and (iv) an improvement in our purchasing costs, in particular
through a reduction in the number of suppliers of DIY, Bijenkorf and V&D and an increase in the
share of our Far East sourcing (in particular related to apparel and do-it-yourself products). We expect
that some of these cost savings could be achieved in the near term, and we believe that the
reorganization of V&D has demonstrated our ability to achieve cost savings rapidly and on a significant
scale, with approximately A50 million cost savings on an annualized basis achieved six months after
announcement.

The management of working capital has not previously been a key priority of our business units,
and we believe that significant cash-generating opportunities exist through renegotiating payment terms
with our suppliers across all of our business units and through improving our inventory management
through investment in automation and IT. Some of our business units have significantly shorter
payment terms than comparable businesses operating in similar markets, and we expect to be able to
improve payment terms with many of our suppliers in the near term. While the implementation of
logistics automation or up-to-date retail software can take time, we believe that the successful
mechanization of the HEMA distribution center in 2003 has illustrated our ability to implement such
measures and to generate the expected inventory reductions successfully and on a timely basis.

**_Continue the Integration and Selective Expansion of our DIY Formats_**

Our DIY formats in the Netherlands and Belgium have historically operated as separate businesses
with little coordination. We believe that significant opportunities exist to increase profitability and to

96


-----

reduce working capital by coordinating purchasing across these formats as well as by sharing resources
and exchanging best practices between them.

In parallel to the implementation of these measures, we will continue to selectively expand our
successful medium-size Brico store concept and large-size Brico Plan-It store concept in Belgium
through further conversions and store openings, and thereby drive our like-for-like sales growth and
reinforce our market position in the country. We may also pursue selected store-opening opportunities
in the Dutch market.

**_Continue to Implement the V&D Restructuring Plan_**

The management team led by Mr. Dirk Goeminne, which successfully turned around HEMA in
1998, has developed and started the implementation of a comprehensive restructuring plan aimed at
restoring the profitability of V&D by (i) cutting cost and (ii) improving gross margin and
re-invigorating like-for-like sales. The first measures of this plan, including a reduction of 1,800 FTEs
and the closing of 12 department stores, have already been successfully completed and have resulted in
annualized cost savings of approximately A50 million and an improvement in V&D’s performance
despite a decline in sales. With the business now stabilized, we are focused on improving gross margin
and re-invigorating V&D’s like-for-like sales growth through a renewal of styling, product offering,
advertising, branding and the introduction of a new store concept.

**_Grow our Business through Selective Initiatives and Disciplined Expansion_**

In addition to the strategies discussed above, we have taken specific initiatives to drive the like-forlike sales growth in our formats, including in particular, adjusting the M&S product offering in line
with its target customer group in the Netherlands, and optimizing our product offering at HEMA (new
fresh food offering and improved children and hardware product lines), and we intend to identify and
pursue similar initiatives going forward.

We also intend to selectively expand our store portfolio to consolidate our market position in the
Netherlands and pursue the international expansion of the retail formats that have demonstrated the
ability to grow successfully in other European countries. In addition to the DIY opportunities discussed
above, we have identified the opening of HEMA stores in the Netherlands (in smaller catchment areas)
and Belgium (to continue HEMA’s successful expansion in this country) and the international
expansion of M&S (in France and Southern Europe) and Hunkem¨oller (mostly in Denmark, France
and Southern Europe) as the most attractive opportunities.

All investment decisions are based on stringent return on capital requirements and we have
adopted a conservative and disciplined approach to our international expansion, starting with extensive
market research, followed by deployment of pilot stores and opening of new stores, if appropriate.

**_Review Strategic Alternatives for Consumer Electronics_**

We are currently in discussions with interested parties with respect to the sale of all or part of the
Consumer Electronics business unit, which may or may not lead to an agreement.

**_Focus on De-leveraging_**

One of our key priorities is to reduce our debt levels. To do so, we will aim to maximize the cash
flows available for debt reduction through the implementation of initiatives to improve operating
efficiencies and a continued focus on the management of our working capital.

‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’ under the terms of the Indenture and are not subject to its restrictive
covenants. See ‘‘The Acquisition, the Property Transaction and Related Transactions.’’

**Our DIY Operations**

Our DIY business unit is the leading player in the do-it-yourself market in the Benelux, with a
clear leadership position in the consolidating Belgian market and a strong number two position in the
Netherlands. Our DIY business unit operates four complementary retail formats (Praxis and Formido
in the Netherlands and Brico and Brico Plan-It in Belgium) which together combine larger and smaller
size and directly operated and franchised stores, selling an extensive range of home improvement
products, decorative items, tools and appliances, principally to retail customers.

The following table shows the breakdown of DIY sales by country, for Half Year 2004:

**Sales by Country** **%**


The Netherlands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58.1

100.0%

Our four DIY retail formats are commercially independent, but are operated under one
management team. Our 123 Praxis and 76 Formido stores together have the second largest share of the
do-it-yourself market in the Netherlands as at August 1, 2004. While they both focus on the same
consumer target group, i.e. retail do-it-yourself customers, and offer a relatively similar product mix
comprising an extensive range of basic do-it-yourself and decorative products, they operate with
different models (Formido operating mostly with franchised stores) and with different store profiles and
catchment areas (Praxis focusing on larger areas and store formats). Our 109 Brico stores and seven
Brico Plan-It stores have the largest share of the Belgian do-it-yourself market as at August 1, 2004.
For Half Year 2004, approximately 12% and 19% of the net turnover in our Dutch and Belgian retail
formats, respectively, was generated from the sale of private label products and we will seek to increase
this share in the future. Our DIY stores range in size from approximately 1,000 m[2] to 15,000 m[2],
representing a total retail space of approximately 979,900 m[2] as at August 1, 2004, of which 287,000 m[2]

are franchised. DIY’s average sales per m[2] was A1,353 in Fiscal 2003 and A1,362 in the Last 12 Months.

_Store portfolio_

As at August 1, 2004, DIY had a total of 321 stores with 205 stores in the Netherlands and
116 stores in Belgium. We own 11 of these stores, consisting of four Brico Plan-It stores, three Praxis
stores and four Brico stores. Our DIY retail formats are differentiated by size and product offering.
Our 123 Praxis stores range in size from approximately 2,000 m[2] to 15,000 m[2] and are organized
between the medium size stores (104 stores of approximately 2,000 m[2] to 5,000 m[2]) and the megastores
(19 stores of approximately 5,000 m[2] to 15,000 m[2]). Our Praxis stores generally stock an average of
approximately 65,000 SKUs throughout the year. Our 109 Brico stores are similar in composition to our
Praxis stores, with a mix of large and small stores, ranging in size from approximately 1,000 m[2] to
13,000 m[2] and generally stocking an average of approximately 40,000 SKUs throughout the year. Our
Brico Plan-It stores are each approximately 9,000 m[2] in size, and stock an average of approximately
40,000 SKUs throughout the year. Formido is predominantly a franchise chain. Formido’s 76 stores are
generally smaller than Praxis, Brico and Brico Plan-It stores, averaging approximately 1,500 m[2] in size,
and generally stock an average of approximately 26,000 SKUs throughout the year.

_Franchises_

As at August 1, 2004, 23 of our 123 Praxis stores, 68 of our 76 Formido stores and 66 of our
109 Brico stores were franchised. In total, we operate directly approximately 49% of our DIY stores.
Our franchised stores are operated by third parties pursuant to standard franchise agreements.
Although franchisees have discretion over both the assortment of products that they stock and their
source of supply, in practice franchisees purchase substantially all of their products from us. Our
franchisees generally adhere to our recommended price and promotion policies, but do occasionally
deviate from them. Praxis and Formido franchisees pay us a fee based primarily on the cost of goods
that they purchase from us, while Brico franchisees pay us a fee primarily based on turnover.

_Supply chain_

As at August 1, 2004, Praxis and Formido jointly purchased merchandise from approximately
170 suppliers, the top 25 suppliers representing approximately 73% of their total purchases.
Merchandise for Praxis and Formido is shipped directly from the suppliers to individual Praxis and

99


-----

Formido stores. We operate an electronic data interchange with our suppliers in the Netherlands, both
for purchasing and invoicing. Brico purchases its merchandise from approximately 800 suppliers with
the top 20 suppliers representing around 40% of the total buying volume. Brico uses a combination of
direct shipment from suppliers to stores and centralized distribution (approximately 60% of its products
by net turnover) whereby suppliers ship to four Brico distribution centers and Brico arranges
distribution, through third party transporters, to Brico stores. Suppliers of Brico Plan-It currently
directly ship the products to our Brico Plan-It stores. We have recently started to integrate Brico PlanIt into the existing supply chain of Brico. We have also initiated in 2003 a unified purchasing program
across Belgium and the Netherlands whereby we have granted certain manufacturers a ‘‘preferred
supplier’’ status in exchange for more favorable terms. We also intend to implement a gradual supplier
consolidation between Belgium and the Netherlands, which we believe will further improve our
negotiating leverage with our suppliers.

_Advertising and marketing_

DIY’s advertising and marketing strategy focuses on television advertising, sponsorship and
distribution of leaflets. Praxis directly distributes approximately six million leaflets to homes in the
Netherlands 33 times per year. Formido advertises primarily through the direct distribution of
2.4 million leaflets 29 times per year and radio advertisements. Brico advertises primarily through the
direct distribution of 3.7 million leaflets 14 times per year and through the publication of a large
catalogue that is made available in each Brico store location once per year. Other than Brico Plan-It,
all of our DIY retail formats also advertise via their own websites.

_Competition_

We estimate the size of the Dutch do-it-yourself market to be approximately A4 billion. The Dutch
do-it-yourself market is relatively mature, with historic growth rates moderately exceeding GDP and a
relatively high share of do-it-yourself specialists. We have the second largest market share in the Dutch
do-it-yourself market after Intergamma, and we estimate that, together with Intergamma, we represent
approximately 60% of the Dutch market based on net turnover. Based on net turnover for Half Year
2004, we estimate that we have a 24% market share, compared to a 36% market share for Intergamma.
Hornbach, a German large size, low-cost do-it-yourself retailer currently also operates six stores and
two garden centers in the Netherlands.

We estimate the size of the Belgian do-it-yourself market to be approximately A3.6 billion and this
market is still relatively fragmented, with many independent operators and buying groups. We are the
leading do-it-yourself retailer in Belgium and believe that we have a substantially higher market share
than the second largest do-it-yourself retailer in Belgium, Intergamma.

**Our HEMA Operations**

HEMA is a general merchandise retailer operating 313 stores in the Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany as at August 1, 2004. HEMA is a unique retail formula, with substantially all items sold under
the HEMA brand name. The merchandise assortment consists of items used regularly in typical
households: cosmetics, basic apparel (baby clothes, underwear and general apparel), hard goods
(household goods, linen and office supplies) and food (including baked goods, meats, confectionery and
wine); and the selection focuses on quality, low price, reliability and contemporary style. HEMA is a
Dutch institution, enjoying an excellent brand image (with a virtually 100% brand awareness in the
Netherlands, HEMA was elected the best retail store in the Netherlands in the 2003 Elsevier Retail
Survey for the second consecutive year) and a market leadership in a number of categories. Targeting
the middle to low-end of the market, HEMA has developed a unique position (less expensive than
department stores but better quality than discounter products), which has resulted in a loyal customer
base and high foot traffic of, on average, four million visitors per week. HEMA also offers a photo

service department in most of its stores in the Netherlands, and the majority of HEMA stores include a
cafeteria. The following table shows the breakdown of HEMA sales by country, for Half Year 2004:

HEMA stores are designed to be convenient for customers and offer easy accessibility, functional
product displays, quick payment facilities and customer-friendly guarantee and return policies. HEMA
stores range in size from approximately 400 m[2] to 2,300 m[2], representing a total retail space as at
August 1, 2004 of approximately 305,800 m[2]. HEMA employed 10,519 people as at August 1, 2004.
HEMA’s average sales per m[2] was A3,081 in Fiscal 2003 and A3,055 in the Last 12 Months.

_Store portfolio_

As at August 1, 2004, our HEMA stores consisted of 271 stores in the Netherlands, 39 stores in
Belgium and three pilot stores in Germany. Our HEMA stores are customarily located in areas of high
density such as city and town centers. In 1997, as part of a restructuring, HEMA adopted a
standardized approach that classified its stores into four store categories based on market size and
catchment area (two city center store categories, convenience stores and large stores), each store
category having a specified layout and product assortment. Large stores range in size from
approximately 2,000 m[2] to 2,300 m[2], while smaller stores range in size from approximately 400 m[2] to
600 m[2]. While all of our stores carry substantially the same merchandise categories, the smaller stores
offer a more limited assortment within each of these categories. Our stores offer from approximately
15,000 to 30,000 SKUs, depending on the season and their category. Since the restructuring, HEMA
has reconfigured all of its stores to fit within one of these four standardized store categories, reducing
operating complexity, and hence allowing us to streamline HEMA’s head office and to maintain better
supply chain management, which has resulted in lower operating expenses and increased profitability.

_Franchises_

As at August 1, 2004, we operated directly 182 stores, or approximately 58%, of our HEMA stores.
The remaining 131 HEMA stores, all of which were located in the Netherlands, were operated by
approximately 100 third-party franchisees, generally pursuant to standard agreements. Franchise stores
must conform to the standardized store layout that we have established for each format category and
must stock the complete range of SKUs that we offer for a similar store category. Franchisees are not
permitted to offer non-HEMA merchandise and services, with the exception of certain limited
non-HEMA branded food items. Under HEMA’s franchise agreements, franchisees must purchase from
us the HEMA products and services that they offer in their stores. HEMA advises franchisees to offer
merchandise at the same price at which we offer items in our company-operated stores, though
franchisees are entitled to deviate from the recommended price. Our HEMA franchisees must pay us a
fee that is calculated as a fixed percentage of the retail value of all of the goods that they purchase
from us.

_Supply chain_

As a general merchandiser that sells mostly HEMA-branded products, HEMA continuously
reviews its relationships with its suppliers in order to improve its margins. With the exception of
manufacturing, HEMA seeks to control all aspects of the supply chain, including styling, purchasing,

101


-----

merchandising, marketing and other functions. HEMA has category management teams, all of which
are located at its head office in Amsterdam, for each of its 15 product categories.

HEMA uses a centrally organized replenishment system for ordering stock and uses daily sales
information to help determine purchasing levels. Certain products, such as perishable food items, can
be purchased and stocked quickly. HEMA has approximately 1,150 suppliers, which are predominantly
located in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. HEMA’s strong position in certain apparel items (such as
socks and underwear), cosmetics and pastries enables it to obtain particularly competitive terms with its
suppliers for these products.

With the exception of fresh food products, which are delivered directly from its suppliers, HEMA
delivers the majority of its merchandise to its stores in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany through
its distribution center located in the Netherlands. A three-year project to mechanize this distribution
center, representing a total investment of A25 million, was recently completed and has improved stock
availability at our stores and further reduced our unit logistic costs.

_Advertising and marketing_

HEMA’s advertising and marketing strategy focuses on direct distribution of brochures. HEMA
distributes approximately 4.8 million brochures with prominent price points relating to specific
merchandise 14 times per year. We also distribute the same number of brochures eight times per year
to more generally promote our brand. We also advertise nationally on billboards in the Netherlands
and support certain promotional events with radio advertising.

_Competition_

HEMA’s competitors vary by merchandise category and include in the Netherlands C&A, Wibra
and Zeeman for apparel, Xenos and Blokker for general merchandise, DA and Kruidvat for cosmetics
and personal care products, and Albert Heijn and Kruidvat for photo developing.

**Our Apparel Operations**

Our Apparel business unit is our most international unit, operating 735 stores in seven countries,
and consists of three retail formats: M&S, Hunkem¨oller and Claudia Str¨ater. Our three formats offer
private label women’s apparel that is carefully designed to appeal to particular segments of the market.
Each of our Apparel retail formats is managed separately. The following table shows the breakdown of
Apparel sales by country, for Half Year 2004:

Fiscal 2003 and A3,727 in the Last 12 Months.

The largest of our Apparel retail formats is M&S, a discount boutique for women over 35, which
offers fashionable clothing at competitive prices, and in a wide range of sizes. M&S operated through
422 stores in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, as at August 1,

2004. Of our Apparel retail formats, M&S has the largest presence outside of the Netherlands with
over two-thirds of its net turnover generated from outside the Netherlands in the Last 12 Months.

Hunkem¨oller, which was founded more than 120 years ago, sells lingerie, swimwear and nightwear
via 285 stores in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, France and Luxembourg, as of the end
of Half Year 2004. During Half Year 2004, approximately 50% of Hunkem¨oller’s sales were generated
from outside the Netherlands. Offering contemporary designs under the Hunkem¨oller label at
affordable prices for all women, Hunkem¨oller is the preeminent store for lingerie in the Netherlands,
where it won the MasterCard Retailer of the Year Award for 2003, in the retail chain category.

Founded more than 30 years ago, Claudia Str¨ater primarily sells high-end professional and casual
women’s apparel through its 27 stores in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, as at August 1,
2004, and on a wholesale basis to other selected retailers in Western Europe. In addition, in
September 2003, we opened our first Claudia Str¨ater pilot store in Germany. We are currently
considering further expansion in Germany after our pilot store performed satisfactorily for Half Year
2004.

M&S stores range in size from approximately 130 m[2] to 300 m[2], with the majority of stores ranging
from approximately 180 m[2] to 220 m[2]. M&S stores are generally laid out in a standard format and
stock an average of approximately 2,750 SKUs throughout the year. Most of our M&S stores are
located in areas of high density such as prime town and city centers with the exception of
approximately half of our French stores, which are located in out-of-town shopping centers.

Hunkem¨oller stores are designed in a single format, with our stores generally ranging in size from
approximately 120 m[2] to 140 m[2]. Most stores stock an average of approximately 9,000 SKUs throughout
the year. Hunkem¨oller stores are generally located in highly sought after commercial areas within prime
town and city centers.

Claudia Str¨ater stores are categorized in three different layouts, ranging in size from approximately
120 m[2] to 400 m[2], and stock an average of approximately 2,800 SKUs throughout the year. Claudia
Str¨ater stores are located exclusively in prime town and city centers.

_Franchises_

As at August 1, 2004, we operated directly 697, or approximately 95%, of our Apparel stores. The
remaining 38 stores, all of which are Hunkem¨oller stores located in the Netherlands, were operated by
11 franchisees, generally pursuant to standardized franchise agreements. Our Hunkem¨oller franchisees
pay us a fee based on their turnover.

_Supply chain_

Our Apparel retail formats sell almost exclusively private label products. Accordingly, each of
M&S, Hunkem¨oller and Claudia Str¨ater seeks to control the majority of its supply chain in order to
assure, among other things, proper merchandising, quality control and timely delivery of products to its
stores. Each of our Apparel retail formats has departments, located at their respective head offices in
the Netherlands, dedicated to styling, purchasing, merchandising, and marketing. Our Apparel retail
formats outsource the manufacturing of substantially all of their products to third parties.

Starting in Fiscal 2002, M&S initiated a program for optimizing its supply chain management with
the aim of increasing stock turnover, reducing mark-downs, and ultimately increasing its profitability.
As part of this program, M&S reduced the number of its suppliers from approximately 200 to
approximately 110 (including third party manufacturers of its apparel collections, as well as fabric and
garment accessory suppliers) as at August 1, 2004. In addition, in December 2003, M&S completed the
upgrade of its supply chain management software, which has improved its inventory management. M&S
has also increased the proportion of products contracted for manufacturing in China in order to reduce
its sourcing costs. M&S currently operates three distribution centers from which all of its products are
delivered to its stores by third party contractors. These distribution centers are located in southern
France, in northern France and in Amsterdam.

Hunkem¨oller is also optimizing its supply chain management process. Starting in Fiscal 2002,
Hunkem¨oller upgraded its supply chain management software, which resulted in improved stock
turnover, increased product availability and lower head office costs. As at August 1, 2004, Hunkem¨oller
had approximately 60 suppliers, including manufacturers and fabric and garment accessory providers.
Hunkem¨oller sources most of its products in Asia. Hunkem¨oller currently operates one distribution
center in the Netherlands, from which all of its products are delivered to its stores. We believe that this
distribution center has sufficient capacity to cover the distribution needs related to planned store
openings.

Although Claudia Str¨ater has not had to make significant changes to the management of its supply
chain due to its smaller size and limited expansion in recent years, we are introducing new supply chain
management software aiming to improve tracking of stock and stock turnover. As at August 1, 2004,
Claudia Str¨ater had approximately 80 suppliers, including manufacturers and fabric and garment
accessory providers. Claudia Str¨ater generally sources materials from European producers and
manufactures its apparel in Asia. Claudia Str¨ater currently operates one distribution center in the
Netherlands from which it delivers all of its products to its stores and its wholesale customers.

_Advertising and marketing_

Apparel’s advertising and marketing strategy focuses on using the stores, many of which are
located in high traffic retail areas, as primary communication vehicle (including with large posters and
price signals). In addition, we make use of limited advertising in women’s magazines and billboards for
M&S; direct distribution of leaflets for Hunkem¨oller; and direct mail and newspaper advertising for
Claudia Str¨ater. Claudia Str¨ater also advertises in some women’s fashion magazines in the United
Kingdom, where third party vendors sell Claudia Str¨ater branded products.

Hunkem¨oller is evaluating a rebranding strategy in order to improve the effectiveness of its
expansion plans.

_Competition_

The Dutch apparel market is a mature market characterized by a high store density and a relative
stability of the competitive environment. In this market, M&S has a unique position as a discount
boutique for women in the over 35 age group. Nevertheless, the chain is exposed to competition from

104


-----

C&A, Miss Etam, V¨ogele and H&M as well as from independent retailers. In France as well, in spite
of the competition from Pimkie, H&M, C&A, Camaieu and J. Riu, M&S’s offering is clearly
differentiated and we expect to benefit from the same differentiation in Spain. By contrast, in
Germany, M&S faces significant competition from C&A, Biba and Wehmeyer in an environment that is
heavily focused on discount.

Hunkem¨oller competes with other lingerie retailers, such as Etam Lingerie, Women’s Secret,
Livera, Palmers and Lindex, and with other lingerie brands such as Triumph.

Claudia Str¨ater, positioned as a niche player, faces its most direct competition from a diverse
group of smaller, independent retailers. In addition, Claudia Str¨ater competes with recognized brand
names, such as Max Mara, Hugo Boss and Ralph Lauren, which are sold through various outlets.

**Our Bijenkorf Operations**

Bijenkorf is the only national up-market department store in the Netherlands operating
12 department stores and one outlet store in the Netherlands as at August 1, 2004. Bijenkorf offers a
wide variety of up-market products, including apparel, cosmetics, accessories, household goods, leisure
goods and fine foods, with international premium brands and A-brands as well as private label brands.

Bijenkorf generated approximately 25% of its apparel net turnover (which represents
approximately 60% of Bijenkorf’s total net turnover) from the sale of private label merchandise for
Half Year 2004, but we are seeking to increase this level to approximately 30% over the next few years.
Bijenkorf stores, which are located in the centers of the larger cities in the Netherlands, range in size
from approximately 3,000 m[2] to 20,000 m[2], representing a total retail space of approximately 110,225 m[2]

as at August 1, 2004. Bijenkorf also offers business-to-business gifts in a service referred to as
‘‘Bijenkorf Business Cadeau’’ which we are currently considering discontinuing. We operate directly all
of our Bijenkorf stores, without any franchised operations. Bijenkorf’s average net sales per m[2] was
A3,871 in Fiscal 2003 and A3,752 in the Last 12 Months.

_Store portfolio_

As at August 1, 2004, Bijenkorf had 12 department stores and one outlet store in the Netherlands.
We are currently considering opening a further outlet store in the Netherlands. Our Bijenkorf stores
are split into three categories based on retail space. Our three flagship stores, all owned, are located in
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, and range in size from approximately 15,000 m[2] to 20,000 m[2],
each featuring an extensive range of products of approximately 350,000 SKUs, on average, over the
course of a year. Our six medium sized stores range in size from approximately 7,500 m[2] to 9,000 m[2],
and generally offer the same product range as our flagship stores, while our three smaller fashion
stores (of approximately 3,000 m[2]), focus primarily on men’s and women’s apparel.

Our flagship store located in Amsterdam, the oldest and largest Bijenkorf store, is currently subject
to a major refurbishment and expansion project, which started in the first quarter of 2003. With this
project, which consists of several stages and is expected to be fully completed by mid-2006, the
Amsterdam store will be enlarged by 3,000 m[2] (to 20,000 m[2]) and will be fully redesigned in order,
inter alia, to optimize women’s and men’s apparel offerings and add new services.

_Supply chain_

Bijenkorf’s supply chain varies across its merchandise assortment, which includes branded as well
as private label products. Bijenkorf has product category management teams, which include buyers,
visual merchandisers, merchandise planners and supply chain specialists, for each of its six product
categories. Bijenkorf controls most aspects of the supply chain for private label products, from their
design and the selection of materials used in their production to contracting the manufacturing. The

105


-----

product category management teams focus primarily on concept building, merchandising and marketing
for branded products. These product category management teams are all located at Bijenkorf’s head
office in Amsterdam.

A central replenishment system is used for ordering stock and uses daily sales information to help
determine purchasing levels. Certain products, such as watches, small leather goods and certain
jewellery, can be purchased and stocked quickly, while others have longer lead times. All of Bijenkorf’s
stores are supplied by its central distribution center located in the Netherlands.

Bijenkorf has approximately 900 suppliers, which are located predominantly in Europe and Asia.
Bijenkorf’s strong position as a retailer of branded products enables it to obtain particularly
competitive terms with its suppliers. To the extent possible, we arrange for suppliers of branded
products that fit within our store concept, such as Benetton and Esprit, to operate ‘‘store-in-store’’
retail operations as concessionaires. Under this arrangement, the suppliers undertake inventory risk on
their own merchandise and staff the retail operation with their own employees and we receive a
concession fee based on the concessionaire’s turnover.

_Advertising and marketing_

Bijenkorf utilizes an extensive database of customer information that we have built by tracking
purchases from approximately 400,000 holders (representing 280,000 addresses) of our existing loyalty
store card, the BIJcard. This enables Bijenkorf to send targeted marketing materials to particular
customer segments. For example, we send targeted brochures relating to men’s apparel, women’s
apparel or other departments, as appropriate, to our customers. We do not generally advertise on
television, with the exception of certain targeted advertisements, for example in advance of our annual
autumn ‘‘Three Crazy Days’’ (Drie Dwaze Dagen) promotion.

As part of our regular promotional activities, we print approximately 1.2 million copies of our
BIJmagazine and distribute them at least five times per year to our BIJcard holders and in our stores.
In May 2003, Bijenkorf began the publication of a brochure in the layout of a newspaper called
BIJnews (BIJnieuws), which is mailed to our BIJcard holders four times per year and is available in our
stores, and which aims to attract customers through better price signalling. Customer feedback on
BIJnews has been positive and we believe that the brochure has contributed to an increase in sales
since its introduction.

Our BIJcard, which is utilized for approximately 30% of all Bijenkorf store purchases, is a dual
MasterCard and store card, which allows our customers to use their BIJcards not only to make
purchases at our stores, but also to purchase goods and services where MasterCard is accepted.
Holders of our BIJcard receive early entry to store events, loyalty points, and discounts on certain
merchandise. Administration of the BIJcard is conducted by International Card Services B.V., a
subsidiary of Fortis Bank, which assumes the credit risk on BIJcard transactions.

We also continuously improve the look and feel of Bijenkorf’s website and Internet shop, which
are integrated into Bijenkorf’s multi-channel strategy. Bijenkorf’s main target audiences for its Internet
channel are men and younger customers, and the selected product range offered will be expanded with
a complimentary service package targeted to these groups (e.g. a ticket reservation service for special
events such as concerts).

_Competition_

Besides Bijenkorf, V&D is the only other department store chain operating in the Dutch non-food
retail market. Although there is some overlap between Bijenkorf and V&D in certain product areas, we
believe that Bijenkorf and V&D do not compete substantially with each other because Bijenkorf is
focused on the up-market segment and V&D on the middle-market segment. Bijenkorf’s competitors

106


-----

vary by merchandise category and are primarily the specialist retail stores operating in each of its
product categories.

**Our V&D Operations**

V&D is the only national middle-market department store chain in the Netherlands operating
60 stores and 16 stand alone La Place restaurants, as at August 1, 2004. V&D offers a wide variety of
products in several categories, including apparel, lifestyle and home entertainment. We estimate that
V&D receives on average 1.8 million visitors per week.

V&D sells most of its products, especially in apparel, under its own labels (approximately 80% of
V&D’s annual apparel net turnover is generated by private label merchandise, which represented
approximately one-half of V&D’s total net turnover for Half Year 2004). In addition, most V&D stores
also include well known and popular restaurants (operating under the name La Place) and bakery
departments (operating under the name Le March´e). We also operate an additional 16 stand-alone La
Place restaurants. We are currently in discussions with an interested party with respect to possible
developments for these 16 stand-alone restaurants. In aggregate, V&D’s La Place restaurant and Le
March´e bakery operations account for approximately 15% of V&D’s net turnover. V&D’s 60 stores
range in size from approximately 3,000 m[2] to 16,000 m[2], which represents a total retail space as at
August 1, 2004 of approximately 328,100 m[2]. We operate directly all of the V&D stores without any
franchised operations. V&D’s average sales per m[2] was A2,307 in Fiscal 2003 and A2,175 in the Last 12
Months.

_Store portfolio_

As at August 1, 2004, V&D had 60 stores in the Netherlands and 16 stand alone La Place
restaurants. All of our V&D stores are located in the primary central shopping areas of the cities and
towns that they serve. As part of the restructuring of V&D, as discussed below, we are in the process
of implementing a standardized approach that classifies V&D stores into three categories (core,
compact and flagship). Each category will have a standardized store layout and product range. The size
of a core store category will be approximately 6,000 m[2] to 8,000 m[2]. Core stores will focus on a number
of anchor departments. Compact stores will be stores of up to 6,000 m[2] and will have fewer
departments but will generally carry the same range of merchandise as core stores, within particular
anchor departments. Flagship stores, all of which will be located in major Dutch cities, will generally be
more than 8,000 m[2] in size.

_Supply chain_

As part of V&D’s restructuring, we are in the process of improving our supply chain by integrating
the buying, the supply chain management and the operational functions. In particular, we have started
to implement the SAP retail system and a sales-based bonus scheme for our suppliers in order to
optimize deliveries. In addition, we have reduced the number of suppliers by approximately 64% from
3,600 to 1,300 by the end of Half Year 2004. See below ‘‘—Our V&D Operations—The V&D
Restructuring.’’

_Advertising and marketing_

As part of the V&D restructuring, we have significantly changed our marketing and promotional
campaigns to improve V&D’s image. Given the relatively high levels of foot traffic that we enjoy in our
V&D stores (approximately 1.8 million visitors per week), we expect that changes in our product
offering and arrangements will be communicated to our existing customer base directly each time they
visit a V&D store. We currently distribute approximately four million brochures on a bi-weekly basis
within selected catchment areas.

_The V&D Restructuring_

Our V&D department store activities experienced operating losses of A35 million in Half Year
2003 as a result of fundamental problems affecting the business. In response, we decided to replace the
chairman and director of operations of V&D by respectively Mr. Dirk Goeminne and Mr. Eug`ene
Randag who previously held the same positions at HEMA. The management team led by Mr.
Goeminne, who already successfully engineered the turnaround of HEMA, has developed and is
currently implementing a comprehensive turnaround strategy for V&D, that was announced in
September 2003. In relation to the restructuring plan we took an A80 million one-time reorganization
charge in the second half of Fiscal 2003 consisting of a A60 million headcount reduction charge and a
A20 million charge for store closures.

This restructuring plan, which has been approved by the Workers’ Council, targeted significant cost
savings, primarily related to a headcount reduction at V&D’s head office and in the stores. As at
August 1, 2004, most of these savings were achieved and the headcount was reduced by approximately
1,800 in July 2004 from a total of 8,500 FTE’s.

In addition, we closed 12 V&D stores during Half Year 2004 and are currently developing a
standardized approach for our stores that will be classified in three categories: core, compact and
flagship stores. Also, our capital expenditures were significantly reduced from A29 million for Half Year
2003 to A11 million for Half Year 2004.

The V&D restructuring and operating cost improvements are substantially completed with
annualized cost savings already achieved of approximately A50 million as of the end of Half Year 2004,
and our management team is therefore now focused on improving gross margin and on reinvigorating
like-for-like sales growth. This will be achieved in part by improving our product offering and
assortment. As an example, we will aim to increase our apparel net turnover as a percentage of total
net turnover and to make our product offering more coherent. We will also increase the frequency of
change in the collections by ordering smaller lots on a more frequent basis, and will improve the styling
function. We are also considering discontinuing certain product ranges that we believe no longer fit
within our department store format, such as furniture. In addition, we are reviewing our advertising and
branding strategy and as part of this will rationalize our private label portfolio. We also believe that
standardizing our store categories will allow us to simplify our supply chain by reducing the number of
SKUs from 400,000 to a target 250,000 and to further reduce the number of our suppliers. In addition,
we believe a standardized store format and more coherent product offering will assist in improving
V&D’s image.

We believe that, despite recent difficulties, V&D occupies a viable competitive position in the
Dutch non-food retail market as the only middle-market department store chain. Similar department
stores, such as Debenhams in the United Kingdom, have proved that the middle-market department
store concept can be profitable through proper execution of the business. V&D is currently the only
department store occupying this market position in the Netherlands. In addition, we believe that our
store portfolio (including associated attractive rental contracts), with prime locations in Dutch town and
city centers, provides us with a competitive advantage given the limited availability of high quality retail
locations in the Netherlands.

_Competition_

Besides V&D, Bijenkorf is the only other department store chain operating in the Dutch non-food
retail market. Although there is some overlap between V&D and Bijenkorf in certain product areas, we
believe that V&D and Bijenkorf do not compete substantially with each other because Bijenkorf is
focused on the up-market segment and V&D on the middle-market segment. V&D’s competitors vary
by merchandise category and are primarily the specialist retail stores operating in each of its product
categories.

**Our Consumer Electronics Operations**

Our Consumer Electronics business unit operates five retail formats (Dixons, Dynabyte, It’s,
Modern Electronics and Prijstopper) that cover most segments of the consumer electronics market:
multimedia, computer, digital photography, household electronics and brown and white goods. We are
currently in discussion with interested parties with respect to the sale of all or part of our Consumer
Electronics business unit, which may or may not lead to an agreement.

Our Consumer Electronics business unit operates 314 stores in the Netherlands and three in
Belgium, as at August 1, 2004. We believe that we are among the leading consumer electronics retailers
in the Netherlands. Dixons and Dynabyte are headed by one management team but operate
independently and have distinct market positioning. It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper also
operate under a single management team but operate independently at the commercial level. Our
Consumer Electronics stores are up to approximately 2,800 m[2] in size, representing a total retail space
as at August 1, 2004 of approximately 111,650 m[2]. As at August 1, 2004, we operated directly all of the
Consumer Electronics stores, with the exception of six Dixons stores which are operated by franchisees.
The Consumer Electronics business unit’s average sales per m[2] was A5,338 in Fiscal 2003 and A5,468
during the Last 12 Months.

Dixons is primarily focused on leisure electronics, offering a varied assortment of personal
computers, computer accessories, telecommunications products, cameras, game consoles, software,
camcorders and portable audio equipment through 139 stores in the Netherlands and three in Belgium,
as at August 1, 2004. Our Dixons stores operate under a permanent licence which allows us to use the
Dixons name in the Netherlands and Belgium. We pay no royalties under this licence.

Dynabyte is a specialist store for computers and peripherals with 38 stores in the Netherlands, as
at August 1, 2004. Dynabyte has experienced and knowledgeable sales staff in this specialist sector.

IMpact (which comprises It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper) is a multi-format retailer of
household electronics and brown and white goods and offers home cinema products, electrical
household equipment products, as well as a limited range of computers and computer accessories,
through 137 stores in the Netherlands as at August 1, 2004.

_Store portfolio_

The following table shows the breakdown of Consumer Electronics’ stores by retail format, for
Half Year 2004:

**Retail Format** **Number of Stores**


Dixons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 142

**Total: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **317**


Dixons stores have an average size of approximately 125 m[2] and stock an average of approximately
4,000 SKUs. Dynabyte stores have an average size of approximately 175 m[2] and stock an average of
approximately 2,200 SKUs. Although not required by the terms of the licence with Dixons UK, our
Dixons stores are modelled to have a similar style and feel to Dixons stores in the United Kingdom.
While Dixons is positioned as a high technology retailer on prime high street locations, Dynabyte stores
generally occupy secondary locations on, and adjacent to, high streets. It’s stores range in size from
approximately 200 m[2] to 2,100 m[2] and stock an average of approximately 5,500 SKUs. Modern

109


-----

Electronics stores range in size from approximately 200 m[2] to 2,800 m[2] and stock an average of
approximately 5,000 SKUs. Prijstopper stores range in size from approximately 250 m[2] to 650 m[2] and
stock an average of approximately 1,250 SKUs.

_Supply chain_

The combination of It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper into IMpact included the integration
of their respective supply chain processes. Through this process we unified all of their respective
support, back-office, purchasing and logistics functions. It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper are all
now supported by one IT platform, which utilizes SAP software, one centralized distribution and
delivery center and two additional delivery centers, all of which are located in the Netherlands. Dixons
and Dynabyte manage their supply chain processes separately with their own back offices, IT platforms
and distribution centers.

Dixons and Dynabyte have approximately 110 and 30 suppliers, respectively. It’s, Modern
Electronics and Prijstopper, together, have 60 suppliers. By combining the supply chain management of
It’s, Modern Electronics and Prijstopper, we have been able to improve purchasing terms with our
suppliers.

_Advertising and marketing_

Consumer Electronics’ advertising and marketing strategy focuses on brochures and leaflets as well
as the Internet. It’s and Modern Electronics print and home deliver 4.2 million and 3.4 million leaflets,
respectively, on a bi-weekly basis to potential customers. Dynabyte prints and distributes approximately
2.7 million brochures 13 times per year, while Dixons prints and distributes approximately 4 million
brochures on a monthly basis. Each retail format also uses the Internet to market and sell its products.

_Competition_

Dixons, Dynabyte and IMpact are leading players in the Dutch electronics retailing market. In this
market, our principal competitors vary by format. Dixons and Dynabyte compete principally with
non-chain retailers and with chain stores such as Vobis and MediaMarkt. They also compete with
online retailers such as Dell, Compaq and Amazon. It’s and Modern Electronics compete principally
with MediaMarkt, United Retail, Expert and BCC as well as non-chain retailers of general consumer
electronics products in the Netherlands.

**Property**

In addition to our six retail business units, we operate directly or through franchises a portfolio of
1,785 stores in the Netherlands (1,168), Belgium (289), France (153), Germany (137), Denmark (19),
Luxembourg (10) and Spain (9), representing a net selling space of approximately two million square
meters. In total, we own 82 stores, of which 71 stores are owned by our Propcos. The properties owned
by the Propcos are subject to a first priority mortgage under the Mortgage Loan and a second priority
mortgage under the Senior Credit Facilities. Our DIY and Consumer Electronics business units directly
own, in aggregate, 11 stores.

_Properties owned_

As at August 1, 2004, our Propcos (HEMA Vastgoed B.V., Bijenkorf Vastgoed B.V., Bijenkorf
Vastgoed II B.V., V&D Vastgoed B.V. and Mavoma B.V.) owned and managed 71 HEMA, Bijenkorf
and V&D stores and three parking lots. The book value of these properties was approximately
A455 million and their market value was approximately A801 million at Half Year 2004. The Propcos
are ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’ under the terms of the Indenture and are not subject to the restrictive
covenants of the Indenture. See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness.’’

110


-----

In addition to the properties owned by our Propcos, our DIY and Consumer Electronics business
units own directly nine and two stores, respectively.

We currently have no plans to buy further properties and plan to effect organic expansion of the
store portfolios of various business units by entering into lease agreements with third parties.

_Properties leased_

Our Propcos lease out the 71 stores and the three parking lots they own to HEMA, Bijenkorf and
V&D for an aggregate expected rental income of A65 million for Fiscal 2004. See ‘‘The Acquisition, the
Property Transaction and Related Transactions.’’

We also lease 1,383 stores from third parties representing a net aggregate annual rental payment
on leased properties of approximately A222 million for the Last 12 Months. The typical length of a
lease for new stores depends on the size and location of the property. In general, our specialty stores
have leases of five years, generally with an extension option of five years. Leases on larger stores, such
as department stores and HEMA stores, generally range from ten to 15 years, and typically have
extension options of ten years. Rents on the stores that we lease are subject to annual price indexing
provisions. Our policy has been to cap these price-indexing provisions, if possible.

Our in-house property department targets locations for new store openings, liaising with the
management of the business units and utilizing geographic databases in order to determine which
locations will be most appropriate for new stores. When we have targeted a location for opening a new
store, we rely on our own resources as well as on experienced national and regional real estate agents
and brokers to locate particular sites. Once a site is identified and the feasibility of the new store
assessed, we submit a store opening proposal to the business unit’s operational board of directors, as
well as to our Board of Management, for approval. We generally seek to ensure that leases, and other
development agreements, comply with industry standards.

**Environmental Matters**

We are subject to a broad range of European Union, national and local environmental laws and
regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations impose
increasingly stringent environmental obligations regarding, among other things, air emissions, asbestos,
noise, wastewater and solid waste discharges, the protection of employee health and safety, the use and
handling of hazardous waste or materials, waste disposal practices and the remediation of
environmental contamination. We could therefore be exposed to costs and liabilities, including liabilities
associated with divested assets and past activities, under environmental laws. In most of the
jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, we are subject to obligations to obtain environmental
permits, licenses and/or authorizations, or to provide prior notification to the appropriate authorities.
Our objective is to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental and pollution control
laws, and all related permit requirements.

We record what we believe to be appropriate reserves for such environmental risks when
environmental assessments are made or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. However, it is often difficult to quantify environmental liabilities, so we may need to revise
our current reserves to address all of our current environmental liabilities.

We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental and
safety regulations. To date, we have not been subject to any material environmental claims. These
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are constantly changing, however, as are the
priorities of those who enforce them. We cannot assure you that environmental conditions relating to
any of our prior, existing or future properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Us and Our

Business—Our properties are subject to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our
operations.’’

**Employees**

We had on average 26,740 FTEs during Half Year 2004. The following table shows the breakdown
of our average FTEs by business unit during Half Year 2004:

Most of our employees at each of our business units are covered by three-year collective labor
agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees at each business unit are generally
good.

**Pensions**

_Pension plan_

As of February 1, 2004, the number of policyholders under Vendex KBB’s main pension fund, was
approximately 87,000, consisting of approximately 32,000 active members, 40,000 paid-up members, and
15,000 retired members. The funding of the scheme is determined by a finance agreement between
Vendex KBB and the pension fund, and should at least cover the actual annual costs of pension
accrued and administration. The funding itself is provided by contributions made by both Vendex KBB
and the covered employee and is determined as a percentage of the relevant employee’s wages, after
deducting a hurdle amount which is revised annually. The division of the contribution between Vendex
KBB and the employee is set out in a collective labor agreement.

The coverage funding ratios of pension plans throughout the Netherlands, including Vendex
KBB’s, have been adversely affected by recently volatile and declining equity markets. Vendex KBB’s
main pension fund, Stichting Pensioenfonds Vendex KBB, had a coverage funding ratio of 103% of its
pension obligations as of February 1, 2004. Pursuant to a recovery plan, approved by the Dutch pension
regulator (Pensioen & Verzekeringskamer), Vendex KBB is required to raise this coverage funding ratio
to 126% by 2014. To achieve this goal, Vendex KBB has increased its total cash contributions from
12.6% in 2001 to 15.0% in 2002 and to 17.6% in 2003 of the total wages for the main pension plan
(after applying a non pensionable salary amount currently set at A16,543 per employee) and from 3%
to 4% in 2003 of the total wages for the early retirement pension plan. In addition, as of January 1,
2004, Vendex KBB raised the early retirement age from 62 to 63. If despite these additional
contributions the pension fund’s funding levels fail to improve, Vendex KBB may have to negotiate
additional changes to its pension plan with the trade unions and may need to obtain further approvals
from the Dutch pension regulator. Possible changes thereto could include a one-time cash injection into
the fund, an increase in Vendex KBB’s ongoing cash contributions, an increase in the employees’ cash
contributions, a suspension or reduction of future indexation or, in extreme cases, a reduction of
benefits. If Vendex KBB were required to increase its cash contribution into the pension scheme, either

as a one-time injection or on an ongoing basis, such payments could negatively impact our ability to
conduct our operations and service our debt obligations, including the notes.

_Accounting treatment of employee benefits and pension liabilities_

With respect to the main pension plan, Vendex KBB does not currently report on its balance sheet
the net amount of pension liabilities and assets. The amount of pension expense recognized in the
profit and loss account generally equals the amount payable to such plan pursuant to the existing
funding agreements.

The issuer accounts for post employment benefits in accordance with the new Annual Reporting
Guideline 271 (2004). Under this new guidance, accounting for the resulting liability is substantially
consistent with IFRS.

Under IFRS, which we are currently considering adopting, and the revised rules of Dutch GAAP
which will take effect on January 1, 2005, the recognition of a provision for pensions (such as sick pay,
early retirement payments and anniversary payments), depends on whether the plan is classified as a
defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan. Under a defined contribution plan, the reporting of
our pension obligation would not be materially different, whereas under a defined benefit plan, we
would be required to establish a provision in the amount equal to the difference between (i) the
estimated future employee benefits relating to past employment periods of employees and (ii) the fair
value of the pension plan assets. In addition, IFRS and the revised Dutch GAAP require the related
amount of pension expense to be determined using a specific allocation method, which may be higher
than amounts funded in the same year. As a result, the profit and loss treatment will be different than
that currently recorded by Vendex KBB. This profit and loss accounting treatment will have no impact
on actual cash payments. We are therefore seeking to modify our main pension plan, which currently
could be classified as a defined benefit plan, by fixing our pension contributions and thereby making it
a defined contribution plan. This would also minimize the extent of our actuarial and investment risk in
respect of pension obligations. In order to do so, the new pension plan, which may only be applicable
to our active members going forward, will have to be agreed with the pension fund, the trade unions,
the Dutch pension regulator and the Dutch tax authorities. Vendex KBB and the trade unions agreed
in principle to conduct further consultations and investigations in order to mitigate the consequences
implied by the accounting change and aim at reaching an agreement by 2005. See ‘‘Annex A—Summary
of Significant Differences Between Dutch GAAP and IFRS—Employee benefits and pension
liabilities.’’

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance to cover risks incurred in the ordinary course of our business, including
general liability, property coverage and workers’ compensation insurance. We believe that our insurance
coverage is suitable for a retailer of our size in the retail markets in which we operate.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are party to a number of legal proceedings, most of which are routine and all of which are
incidental to our business. Some matters involve claims for large amounts of damages as well as other
relief. Other than as described below, we believe that, if any or all of these legal proceedings or
investigations are determined against us, they will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position or results of operations. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be
extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

**_Litigation Relating to the Merger of Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB_**

We were formed through the merger of Vendex International N.V. and N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf
Beheer KBB in 1999. The merger was effected in two stages. First, Vendex International N.V. made a
public offer for the outstanding shares of N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB; subsequently the
two entities were merged pursuant to a statutory proceeding through which remaining N.V. Koninklijke
Bijenkorf Beheer KBB shareholders received shares in Vendex KBB. Leyinvest, a subsidiary of Blokker
and at the time a N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB shareholder, declined to participate in the
public offer, and received shares pursuant to the statutory proceeding. On November 11, 2001,
Leyinvest initiated proceedings against us for monetary damages of NLG 17,902,820 (approximately
A8,123,945) plus interest and legal costs, alleging that the exchange ratio of N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf
Beheer KBB shares for Vendex KBB shares pursuant to the statutory merger (the ‘‘Exchange Ratio’’)
was unfair. In an interim judgement on February 6, 2002, the court of Amsterdam ruled that the
process employed in arriving at the shareholders’ resolution to merge Vendex International N.V. and
N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer KBB was in conflict with principles of reasonableness and fairness,
and that an assessment should be carried out in order to determine whether Leyinvest had suffered
damages as a result thereof. The court also ordered that experts be nominated to report on the
defensibility, by then-current standards, of the Exchange Ratio. We have disputed Leyinvest’s claim and
have appealed this interim judgement.

**_Employment Litigation_**

In 2001, 19 former female employees of HEMA, Bijenkorf and Amici started a joint procedure
alleging that they had been unfairly excluded from the applicable pension plans in the 1970s and 1980s.
In a verdict by the Amsterdam Court this claim was only partially successful for employees, resulting in
a limited award. The employees have appealed the verdict. The final outcome of the proceeding will be
binding on all employees in similar circumstances regardless of whether they have filed a claim.

Following a claim made by a retired female employee of Bijenkorf, the Dutch Equal Treatment
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) determined in early March 2004 that the use of the ‘‘married couples
threshold’’ (gehuwdenfranchise) by Vendex KBB and its main pension fund constitutes an unlawful
discrimination on the basis of gender since the total benefits provided by Vendex KBB and the state
pension scheme are lower for employees living in a dual income couple compared to single employees
or employees living in single-income couples and therefore adversely affect women as they are
statistically more likely to be in dual-income couples. The use of the married couples threshold was
discontinued by Vendex KBB’s main pension fund in 2002. Although the Commission’s ruling is
unenforceable, it could potentially be invoked against Vendex KBB and/or its pension funds in a
judicial action by the claimant or any other current or past employee of Vendex KBB. If a court were
to rule that the married couples threshold is discriminatory, it is likely that the court would consider
damages (or an obligation to recalculate the pension accruals) that have arisen since May 17, 1990,
which is the date on which case law of the European Court of Justice (the Barber case), made equal
treatment on the basis of gender compulsory. Any such court ruling could negatively impact either the
funding position of the pension scheme and/or our ability to service our debt obligations, including the
notes. However, we believe that the Commission’s decision is flawed and therefore that a Dutch court
would be unlikely to apply the same reasoning.

are in line with good market practice for companies of comparable size in our industry. All of the
members of the Board of Management, together with approximately 50 other managers, participate in
the management participation plan described below. The members of the Board of Management are
employed pursuant to permanent employment contracts which mandate a notice period prior to a
member’s resignation.

**_Remuneration of Members of the Board of Management_**

The members of the Board of Management received aggregate remuneration of A2.8 million in
Fiscal 2003, consisting of A1.5 million in salary payments, A650,000 in bonus payments, compensation of
tax and interest and A654,000 in pension payments.

**_Remuneration of Members of the Supervisory Board_**

The members of the Supervisory Board received A160,000 in aggregate remuneration in Fiscal
2003, which was not performance related.

We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

**_Management Participation Plan_**

In connection with the Acquisition, we have recently implemented an equity plan (the
‘‘Management Participation Plan’’ or ‘‘MPP’’) under which approximately 50 top managers of our
group, including the Board of Management of Vendex KBB, may acquire, through an investment in
non-voting depositary receipts in a special purpose entity, an amount, specified individually based upon
the participant’s role within the management team, of equity and loan interests in a parent of the issuer
(the ‘‘Plan Issuer’’) in a mix that includes proportionally more equity and less loan interests than the
Consortium’s investment mix. In addition, MPP participants have been given the opportunity to invest
amounts in addition to the amount specified above in the same equity/loan interest mix as the
Consortium.

The interests held pursuant to the Management Participation Plan are subject to transfer
restrictions and to certain call and put options. In particular, the Consortium may invoke call option
rights on a participant’s interests to the extent that certain time- and performance-based criteria are not
met or in the event that the participant ceases to be employed by the issuer or one of its subsidiaries.
The performance-based criteria relate to the achievement of certain EBITDA, operating cash flow and
net sales targets and are specified for each participating manager. To the extent that the time and
performance criteria are met and a liquidity event takes place through a sale of shares of the issuer or
any direct or indirect holding company thereof or any subsidiary thereof, or the business unit in which
the participant is employed is sold, the participant managers would have the right to sell, or become
obligated to sell, as the case may be, a pro rata portion of its retained interests under the Management
Participation Plan.

**CERTAIN RELATIONS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Advisory Services Agreement and Consulting Services**

VDXK has entered into an advisory services agreement with the Sponsors, whereby the Sponsors
provide VDXK and its affiliates with ongoing consulting and management advisory services for an

individuals may be designated by KKR, (ii) two individuals may be designated by Cinven, (iii) two
individuals may be designated by Permira and (iv) one individual may be designated by AlpInvest. KKR
is entitled to select the chairman of the board of managers of Victoria Holding. Pursuant to the
Investors’ Agreement, the same designation rights apply in respect of the board of directors of Victoria
Acquisition B.V., the immediate subsidiary of Victoria Holding. Victoria Acquisition B.V. is the
corporate director of its direct and indirect subsidiaries above the level of Vendex KBB, including the
issuer.

Pursuant to the Investors’ Agreement, the parties thereto have agreed to use their best efforts to
cause composition of the Supervisory Board of Vendex KBB shall be as follows: (i) two individuals
designated by KKR, (ii) one individual designated by Cinven, (iii) one individual designated by Permira,
(iv) one individual designated by AlpInvest, (v) two individuals having the special confidence of the

vice-chairman of the Supervisory Board of Vendex KBB. The vice-chairman will serve as the chairman
until appointment of the chairman (or, following appointment of the chairman, in his absence). For
further information regarding the Supervisory Board and management of Vendex KBB, see
‘‘Management.’’

**_Governance and Voting Requirements_**

Pursuant to the Investors’ Agreement, decisions to be made by the Consortium members or by the
boards of managers (or similar governing body) of Victoria Holding and the other members of the
group including the issuer and Vendex KBB are to be made by simple majority vote of the Consortium
members of these boards of managers (as the case may be), except (i) amendments to the articles of
association or other organizational documents of any member of the group or any transaction between
any Consortium member or its affiliates and any member of the group will require the approval of 95%
of the shares and other securities held by the Consortium members in Victoria Holding, and (ii) KKR
has the right to approve any initial public offering on or prior to July 5, 2006.

**_Transfer Restrictions_**

The Consortium members have agreed not to transfer any of their shares or related securities in
Victoria Holding other than in accordance with the Investors’ Agreement. Prior to the earlier of an
initial public offering and July 5, 2009, none of the Consortium members may transfer its shares or
related securities in Victoria Holding to a third-party purchaser without the prior approval of a
majority of the shares and other securities held by the Consortium members in Victoria Holding
(excluding those held by the Consortium member proposing to make the transfer). If such approval is
given, the Consortium member may transfer its shares and related securities to such third party
purchaser, subject to the right of the other Consortium members to sell a pro-rata portion of their
shares and other securities to the third party purchaser on the same terms and conditions (‘‘tag-along’’
rights).

Following the earlier of an initial public offering and July 5, 2009, each Consortium member may
transfer its shares and related securities in Victoria Holding to a third party purchaser, subject to
tag-along rights of the other Consortium members. Following an initial public offering, these tag-along
rights will apply only to transfers of listed shares by Consortium members that are not executed on a
securities exchange. Following an initial public offering, each Consortium member may freely transfer
its listed shares on a securities exchange, subject to certain volume limitations contained in the
Investors’ Agreement. All transfers following an initial public offering will be subject to any
underwriters’ lock-ups and applicable securities laws.

If one or more Consortium members (which, prior to July 5, 2007, must include KKR) holding
more than 50% of the shares and related securities in Victoria Holding desire to transfer to a thirdparty purchaser more than 50% of the shares and related securities in Victoria Holding, then these
Consortium members will be entitled to cause the related Consortium members to sell a pro-rata
portion of their shares and other securities to the third-party purchaser on the same terms and
conditions (‘‘drag-along’’ rights). The drag-along rights will terminate following an initial public offering
at such time as the Consortium members collectively cease to hold more than 50% of the listed shares.

Prior to July 5, 2005, KKR has the right to transfer a portion of its shares and related securities in
Victoria Holding to a third-party purchaser without approval of the other Consortium members and not
subject to tag-along rights, provided that, following the consummation of any such transfer, KKR and
AlpInvest continue to hold at least 50% of the shares and related securities in Victoria Holding that
were acquired by them at closing of the Acquisition.

121


-----

Any third party purchaser that acquires shares and related securities from the Consortium
members (other than in a public offering or in a transaction executed on a securities exchange) will be
required to become a party to the Investors’ Agreement.

**_Public Offering Rights_**

The Consortium members will not have the right to sell their shares in an initial public offering or
in any primary offering of shares by the listed company following its initial public offering unless
approved by a simple majority vote of the Consortium members, in which case, each Consortium
member will have the right to sell a pro-rata portion of its shares in the initial public offering or such
subsequent primary offering, subject to the managing underwriters’ cut-backs and other customary
limitations. Following the expiration of the managing underwriters’ lock-up after an initial public
offering, each Consortium member will have the right to request that the listed company act to permit
a public offering of such Consortium member’s listed shares, subject to limitations as to minimum size
of the offering, frequency of the request in relation to any previous request and other limitations set
forth in the Investors’ Agreement. If requested by a Consortium member, then the public offering
would be underwritten. Upon any requested public offering, the other Consortium members would
have the right to participate in such public offering by selling their listed shares. The requesting
Consortium member and each other Consortium member that elects to participate in the public
offering would be subject, on a pro-rata basis, to any cut-back required by the managing underwriters.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following summary of certain provisions of our indebtedness does not purport to be complete and_
_is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents._

**Senior Credit Facilities**

As part of the financing for the Acquisition, Victoria Acquisition II B.V., the issuer, VDXK and
Vendex KBB and certain of their direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into a senior credit agreement
with ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and ING Bank N.V. as mandated lead
arrangers and bookrunners, the banks and financial institutions named therein as lenders, ABN AMRO
Bank N.V. as facility agent and security agent and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and ING Bank N.V. as
issuing banks.

**_Structure_**

The Senior Credit Facilities initially provided for facilities of up to A850 million through a mixture
of three Term Loan facilities and one Revolving Credit Facility, which for legal and practical reasons
were subject to certain sub-tranching. They were subsequently amended to provide for facilities of up
to A890 million through a Revolving Credit Facility of up to A265 million and three Term Loans of up
to A625 million as follows:

   - a seven-year amortizing term loan facility A in an aggregate amount of A300 million;

   - an eight-year term loan facility B in an aggregate amount of A162.5 million; and

   - a nine-year term loan facility C in an aggregate amount of A162.5 million.

The Term Loans have been used to fund the Tender Offer and certain transactions related thereto,
to refinance indebtedness of Vendex KBB and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection
therewith.

The Revolving Credit Facility can be used to finance working capital requirements and for certain
other general corporate purposes and is available by way of cash advances (in euro or certain agreed
other currencies), bank guarantees, letters of credit, bond and similar extensions of credit. Amounts
drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility may be made available in the form of (1) an advance under
the Revolving Credit Facility, (2) an advance under one or more ancillary facilities (up to a maximum
amount of A175 million), or (3) bank guarantees.

As of the date of this offering memorandum no cash drawdowns are outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility. Drawdowns under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to further
conditions precedent that, on the date a drawdown is requested, and on the drawdown date, (1) no
default has occurred and is continuing or will occur as a result of that drawdown and (2) certain
representations and warranties specified in the Senior Credit Facilities are repeated and are true and
accurate with reference to the facts then existing, and will remain true and accurate immediately after
the drawdown is made.

**_Interest Rates_**

The Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR (or, for loans
not denominated in euro, LIBOR) plus any mandatory costs to a lender in respect of its compliance
with reserve asset, liquidity, cash margin or similar banking regulations plus the following margins:

   - 2.25% for term loan facility A;

   - 2.75% for term loan facility B;

   - 3.25% for term loan facility C; and

   - 2.25% for the Revolving Credit Facility.

123


-----

The margins for term loan facilities A and B and the Revolving Credit Facility may be adjusted
below the applicable percentage set out above (the ‘‘initial margin’’) at any time after July 2, 2005 (the
first anniversary of the date of first utilization of the facilities) if (1) no event of default thereunder has
occurred and is continuing and (2) our consolidated quarterly management accounts and related
compliance certificate show that, for the accounting quarter in respect of which such accounts have
been drawn up (the ‘‘testing period’’), the ratio of our total net indebtedness (excluding intra-group
indebtedness) at the end of that quarter to our consolidated EBITDA for the four previous quarters
falls within specified ranges. If the margin is so adjusted, it may revert to a higher margin (no higher
than the initial margin) if for a subsequent testing period this ratio has increased.

**_Fees_**

In addition to paying interest on loans outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, we are
obligated to pay the following fees:

   - with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility, a commitment fee at a rate of the lesser of
(1) 50% of the applicable margin as described above and (2) 0.75% per annum. This
commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears and on the date such facility is cancelled in full;

  - an agency fee in the amount equal to A100,000 per annum; and

  - a fee of 0.125% per annum payable quarterly in arrears to the issuing bank on the aggregate
amount of any bank guarantees, letters of credit, bonds or similar instruments of credit issued
under the Revolving Credit Facility issued by the issuing bank.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

VDXK, Vendex KBB and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the Guarantors,
have guaranteed on a senior basis the borrowers’ obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and
VDXK and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries have granted in favor of the lenders under the
Senior Credit Facilities a first ranking security interest over certain of their assets. In addition, a first
ranking pledge over the shares in VDXK and in Vendex KBB and certain of its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, and a first ranking security interest over the funding loan, have been granted in favor of
the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities. The lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities also
benefit from a second ranking pledge of the shares in each Propco and a second ranking mortgage over
the properties owned by each Propco.

The obligations of each guarantor extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any obligor
under the Senior Credit Facilities and related documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or
discharge in whole or in part. However, to comply with local laws, the French guarantor has guaranteed
only the Revolving Credit Facility and its guarantee is limited to proceeds of loans under the Revolving
Credit Facility that are on-lent to it by a member of the group. The Belgian guarantors have
guaranteed the sums owing under the Revolving Credit Facility, and their guarantee will be limited to
the greater of (a) the monies on-lent to such Belgian Guarantor and (b) 90% of the result of the Net
Assets test as defined in the accession letter by which the Belgian companies became guarantors.

Subject to certain agreed conditions, Vendex KBB will ensure that each of its subsidiaries that
accounts for more than five percent of EBITDA or the consolidated revenues or the consolidated
tangible assets of Vendex KBB and its subsidiaries and any holding company of a borrower become a
guarantor of the Senior Credit Facilities. Such additional guarantor will be required to grant such
security as the facility agent shall require subject to certain agreed conditions and, provided that the
granting of any guarantee and security is not prohibited by the law of the respective jurisdiction of the
relevant subsidiary.

124

   - minimum ratios of consolidated cashflow to total debt service;

  - maximum ratios of total net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA;

  - maximum ratios of total senior net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA; and

selected dates indicated compliance with which ratios is determined against the definitions set out in
the Senior Credit Facilities (which are subject to various assumptions and adjustments as set out in the
Senior Credit Facilities):

**_Maturity and Amortization_**

The Term Loan facility A is to be repaid in semi-annual installments commencing on July 2, 2005
and ending on July 2, 2011. The Term Loan facility B is to be repaid in two equal semi-annual
installments on January 2, 2012 and July 2, 2012. The Term Loan facility C is to be repaid in two equal
semi-annual installments on January 2, 2013 and July 2, 2013. No amounts repaid by the borrowers on
the Term Loan facilities may be re-borrowed.

127


-----

Loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full on the last day of the
interest period applicable to that revolving loan. No amount may be outstanding after July 2, 2011.
Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be
re-borrowed, subject to customary conditions precedent, until June 2, 2011.

**_Prepayments_**

For the purposes of the following, ‘‘Sponsors’’ means, together, KKR, Cinven, Permira and
AlpInvest; ‘‘VDXK’’ means VDXK or any surviving entity following a merger between Vendex KBB
and VDXK; and a ‘‘Listing’’ means a listing of all or any part of the share capital of VDXK or any
holding company of VDXK on a recognized exchange or any other sale or issue by way of flotation or
public offering of any equivalent circumstances in relation to VDXK or a holding company in any
jurisdiction or country.

All amounts payable under the Senior Credit Facilities and related documents are immediately due
and payable and all commitments are cancelled upon (x) the sale of all or substantially all of the
business and/or assets of the group taken as a whole, or (y) the occurrence of certain change of control
events, which include the following:

  - the persons on the management board of VDXK nominated or voted for by the Sponsors or
their affiliates cease to be in the majority on the management board of VDXK; or

  - the shareholder representatives of VDXK nominated or voted for by the Sponsors or their
affiliates cease to be a majority of the shareholder representatives on any supervisory board of
VDXK; or

   - any person or persons acting together (other than the Sponsors and/or their affiliates) acquire
control of VDXK; or

   - the Sponsors and/or their affiliates cease to control more than 50% (or 35% following a Listing
provided that no other holder has a greater percentage than the Sponsors and/or their affiliates
together) of the voting share capital of VDXK; or

   - prior to the earlier of September 30, 2009 and a Listing, KKR and/or its affiliates cease to
control a percentage of the aggregate voting stock of VDXK which is greater than the
percentage controlled by any other Sponsor and/or its affiliates.

Certain mandatory partial prepayments are required to be made out of:

   - net cash proceeds from certain disposals and insurance claims, to the extent that they exceed
certain agreed thresholds;

   - net cash proceeds received in respect of any liability claim against the professional advisers who
prepared reports provided as conditions precedent to the availability of the Senior Credit
Facilities;

  - the net proceeds received from a Listing, in an amount equal to 100% of such net proceeds
(such percentage decreasing in accordance with a schedule in relation to a decrease in the ratio
of total net indebtedness as at the last day of the accounting quarter immediately preceding the
date of prepayment (but after adjusting for the prepayment) to consolidated EBITDA for the
twelve month period ending on such date); and

   - 50% of excess cash flow, as defined in the Senior Credit Facilities, in any financial year
commencing with the financial year ending on or about January 31, 2006 (for so long as the
ratio of total net indebtedness as at the last day of the accounting quarter immediately preceding
the date of prepayment (but after adjusting for the prepayment) to consolidated EBITDA for
the twelve month period ending on such date is equal to or greater than a certain level).

128


-----

Subject to payment for broken funding costs (if any) and certain restrictions, the borrowers may
voluntarily prepay amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities (and, in the case of the
Revolving Credit Facility, cancel unused commitments), without penalty or premium, at any time in
whole or in part subject to agreed minimum amounts and multiples, on not less than five business days’
notice to the facility agent under the Senior Credit Facilities.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Credit Facilities set out certain events of default customary for acquisition financings,
the occurrence of which would allow the lenders to accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their
commitments, including, among other events:

  - non-payment;

  - a covenant breach;

   - a breach of representation or warranty;

  - unlawfulness or repudiation of the financing documents;

   - a cross default under any financial indebtedness in excess of A10 million (or its currency
equivalent) in aggregate;

   - an insolvency, bankruptcy, suspension of payments, receivership, administration, composition,
arrangement, winding-up, attachment or similar event;

   - any security securing any financial indebtedness of A10 million (or its currency equivalent) or
more becomes enforceable and enforcement action is taken in respect of such security;

   - cessation of business;

   - seizure of material assets by a governmental authority;

   - commencement of litigation that is reasonably likely to be negatively determined against a
member of the group and if so determined would have a material adverse effect;

  - a material adverse change;

   - a change in ownership of an obligor except as permitted under the Senior Credit Facilities;

  - uncontested judgments against a member of the group in excess of A10 million or non-monetary
judgments having a material adverse effect;

  - change in holding company status of certain holding companies; and

   - a material audit qualification.

However, the Senior Credit Facilities contain a provision allowing for a clean up period that lasts
for approximately three months after the closing of the Acquisition (the ‘‘Clean Up Period’’). Under
this provision, matters and events that would otherwise constitute breaches of warranty, breaches of a
covenant or events of default under the Senior Credit Facilities will not constitute breaches of warranty,
breaches of a covenant or events of default provided that (1) the breach of warranty or covenant or
event of default was existing at or within approximately one month following the completion of the
Acquisition, (2) the breach of warranty or covenant or event of default relates exclusively to the
business or operations of Vendex KBB and its subsidiaries and (3) if, and for so long as, the relevant
breach of warranty or covenant or event of default:

  - is capable of being cured and, if VDXK or any company that directly or indirectly owns VDXK
(or following the date which is approximately one month after the completion of the Acquisition,
Vendex KBB or any of its subsidiaries) is aware of the relevant circumstances at the time,
reasonable efforts are being used to cure the relevant breach or event;

129


-----

  - has not been procured or approved by VDXK or any company that directly or indirectly owns
VDXK (or following the date which is approximately one month after the completion of the
Acquisition, Vendex KBB or any of its subsidiaries);

   - does not have a material adverse effect; and

  - the relevant circumstances are cured by the expiry of the Clean Up Period.

**_Hedging Arrangements_**

By September 3, 2004, VDXK was required by the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities to enter
into hedging arrangements to provide protection in respect of interest rate risk exposure under the
Term Loans arising because the financing thereunder is at floating interest rates. The Senior Credit
Facilities provides that these hedging arrangements must cover at least 50% of the Term Loans for a
period of at least three years from July 2, 2004. It also provides that hedging banks are granted
security, guarantee and subordination rights that rank at least equally with the rights of the lenders
under the Senior Credit Facilities. For a description of our current hedging arrangements, please see
the section entitled ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.’’

**_Tax Gross Up and Indemnities_**

The Senior Credit Facilities contain provisions relating to the grossing-up of payments that are
subject to withholding tax. The Senior Credit Facilities also contain various indemnities for initial
expenses, enforcement expenses, liabilities in connection with the Acquisition and other customary
matters in respect of liabilities of this type.

**The Debt Push-Down**

On or about September 30, 2004, VDXK is expected to repay the amounts outstanding under the
Bridge Facility and the sub-facilities of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility drawn down by
VDXK with the proceeds of the repayment by Vendex KBB of an intercompany loan granted by
VDXK to Vendex KBB and the proceeds from a new intercompany loan granted by Vendex KBB to
VDXK. Vendex KBB will fund that repayment and intercompany loan with drawings under the facilities
drawn down by VDXK prior to that date and also with existing cash resources. This repayment and
intercompany loan are expected to be funded by a daylight facility to Vendex KBB in order to cover
the overlapping period. As a result, Vendex KBB will be the only borrower under the Senior Credit
Facilities and the Bridge Facility and will be the lender of an intercompany loan to VDXK. The
intercompany loan from Vendex KBB to VDXK will not be repaid with the proceeds of the offering of
the notes, but is expected to be extinguished upon a merger of VDXK and Vendex KBB.

**Funding Loan**

In addition to the loans described above, the issuer will make the funding loan to Vendex KBB by
lending the entire A275 million gross proceeds of the offering of the notes to Vendex KBB. Vendex
KBB will use the proceeds of the funding loan to repay the total amount outstanding under the Bridge
Facility.

Interest will accrue on the funding loan at a rate at least equal to the interest rate payable on the
notes, with such adjustments as may be agreed between the parties or necessary to match any
additional amounts due thereunder, or any special interest payable with respect to the notes. Subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the funding loan is repayable upon the repayment in full or
in part of amounts due under the notes, whether at maturity, on early redemption or upon
acceleration.

130


-----

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of their creditors under the new financing arrangements,
certain members of the group, including the issuer and Vendex KBB, will enter into an Intercreditor
Agreement with the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities (the ‘‘Senior Lenders’’), including ABN
AMRO Bank N.V., as senior facility agent (the ‘‘Senior Agent’’), to which The Bank of New York,
London Branch, as the Trustee, will be required to accede.

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts, among other things:

   - the ability of the subsidiaries of the issuer (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Propcos,
and referred to in this summary of the Intercreditor Agreement as the ‘‘Group’’) that are parties
to the Senior Credit Facilities (the ‘‘Obligors’’) to grant security or give guarantees in favor of an
Obligor’s liabilities under the Guarantees and the Indenture or Vendex KBB’s obligations under
the funding loan (such liabilities and obligations, the ‘‘Notes Liabilities’’);

   - the ability of the holders of the notes, the Trustee and the issuer (in respect of the funding loan)
(each, a ‘‘Notes Creditor’’), to enforce the Guarantees and the security in favor of the notes and
(in the case of the issuer) the funding loan; and

   - the ability of the Obligors to pay, repay, redeem or acquire the Notes Liabilities, or otherwise to
provide financial support in relation to such liabilities, for so long as any obligations under the
Senior Credit Facilities are outstanding.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement requires that the Guarantees and the security in favor of
the notes be released in certain circumstances, and that certain proceeds received by the Notes
Creditors be turned over to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Limitation of Credit Support_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes Creditors are prohibited from taking,
accepting or receiving any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of
the Notes Liabilities, except, to the extent required or permitted by the Indenture and related
documentation, for the guarantees and security permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement. However,
the limitations under the Intercreditor Agreement relating to such guarantees and securities in respect
of the Notes Liabilities will be without prejudice to the obligations of the issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) under the Indenture and related documentation to provide
further security (on a second-ranking basis) or guarantees, indemnities or other assurance against loss
(on a subordinated basis) where such security or guarantees, indemnities or assurance against loss have
been granted or issued on a first-ranking or senior basis, as the case may be, to the senior lenders.

The guarantees of the issuer’s obligations under the notes that are permitted by the Intercreditor
Agreement comprise subordinated upstream guarantees from VDXK and certain of its subsidiaries that
guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement limits the ability of the
Obligors to give guarantees in support of the Notes Liabilities.

The security permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement consists of the second-priority pledge from
the issuer over the entire share capital of VDXK (or its successor company) and a second-ranking
pledge from VDXK over the entire share capital of Vendex KBB. In addition, the Intercreditor
Agreement permits a second-ranking pledge from the issuer over the funding loan. The Guarantees
and the security in favor of the notes granted by the issuer and VDXK is referred to herein as the
‘‘High Yield Security.’’

**_Limitations on Paying the Guarantees and the Funding Loan_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Obligors may only pay, repay, redeem or acquire the
Notes Liabilities (including the liabilities of Vendex KBB in respect of the funding loan) (collectively,
‘‘Pay the Notes Liabilities’’) if such payments constitute a Permitted Payment.

A ‘‘Permitted Payment’’ with respect to Notes Liabilities other than the funding loan includes a
payment to the Notes Creditors in respect of Notes Liabilities that is then due, to the extent that the
payment is a payment:

   - of scheduled interest (excluding default interest) or any amount payable under any tax indemnity
or increased costs provision or provisions for additional amounts or special interest or provisions
for any costs, fees or expenses then due and payable under the notes or the Indenture or the
funding loan, so long as such payment would not be prohibited by a Stop Notice or a Payment
Stop Event (each as defined below) as described below; or

   - of principal funded with the net proceeds of a disposal of one of our business units (other than
Consumer Electronics) made in compliance with the mandatory prepayment provisions of the
Senior Credit Facilities after repayment in full of the Term Loans; or

  - by a Guarantor of all amounts due and payable from it under its Guarantee so long as a
demand has only been made at a time when Notes Creditors are permitted to take Enforcement
Action (as defined below) in respect of such Guarantee.

Following the discharge of indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, any payment made in
accordance with the terms of the notes and the Indenture is permitted.

A Permitted Payment with respect to the funding loan includes a payment which is not prohibited
by the provisions described below in this subheading ‘‘—Limitations on Paying the Guarantees and the
Funding Loan’’ if such payment is a payment of (i) if interest in cash or capitalized interest in respect
of the funding loan, to the extent that the payment is a payment of scheduled interest (excluding
default interest), which payment falls due within five days of the date of payment of interest to the
issuer and enables the issuer to make a profit no greater than 0.125% per annum of the principal
amount of the funding loan; or (ii) any amount payable under any tax indemnity or increased costs
provision or provision for additional amounts or special interest or provisions for any costs, fees, or
expenses then due and payable under the funding loan so long as such payment is not prohibited by a
Stop Notice or a Payment Stop Event; or (iii) principal to the extent it is funded with the net proceeds
of a disposal of one of our business units (other than Consumer Electronics) made in compliance with
the mandatory prepayment provisions of the Senior Credit Facilities after repayment in full of the Term
Loans; or

For so long as a payment is not otherwise prohibited by the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to the effect of a Payment Stop Event and a Stop Notice, in each case as defined
below, any Obligor may on or after the original maturity date of the notes pay the principal amount of
or any other amount due and payable by it under the funding loan or any Guarantee.

While obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are outstanding, the Obligors may not Pay the
Notes Liabilities if a Payment Stop Event occurs, unless (i) the Payment Stop Event is no longer
continuing or has been waived or cured, (ii) the requisite majority of the Senior Lenders instruct the
Senior Agent to consent to such payment, or (iii) the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities
have been repaid in full and the lenders’ commitments thereunder cancelled. Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, a ‘‘Payment Stop Event’’ occurs upon (i) any failure by an Obligor to pay on the due date
any amount payable under the Senior Credit Facilities (other than an amount not constituting principal,
interest or fees, not in excess of A250,000) and (ii) the service of any notice on behalf of the Senior
Lenders declaring all of any facility made available under the Senior Credit Facilities immediately due
and payable or payable on demand as a result of the occurrence of an event of default that is a
payment default in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities.

132


-----

If a Payment Blockage Event is continuing in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities, no Obligor
may Pay the Notes Liabilities for a period (a ‘‘Stop Period’’) commencing upon issuance of written
notice (a ‘‘Stop Notice’’) to the Trustee of such default by the Senior Agent for a period of 179 days
from such issuance, unless a Standstill Period (as defined below) commences during such 179-day
period, in which case the Stop Period shall be the period from the issuance of the Stop Notice to the
expiry of the Standstill Period. In addition, the Stop Period will end if:

  - the Payment Blockage Event in respect of which the Stop Notice was issued is no longer
continuing or has been waived or cured,

   - the requisite majority of the Senior Lenders instruct the Senior Agent under the Senior Credit
Facilities to cancel the Stop Notice or to consent to such payment,

   - the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities have been repaid in full and the lenders’
commitments thereunder cancelled, or

   - any Standstill Period (as defined below under ‘‘—Limitations on Enforcement’’) in effect in
relation to such Stop Notice has expired and the relevant Event of Default under (and as
referred to in) the Indenture to which the Standstill Period relates is still continuing or has not
been waived or cured.

As defined under the Intercreditor Agreement, the ‘‘Payment Blockage Event’’ is the occurrence of
any event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities other than a payment default. The Senior Agent
may not serve any Stop Notice more than 45 days after the Senior Agent receives notice in writing of
the event constituting the Payment Blockage Event. No more than one Stop Notice may be served with
respect to the same event or set of circumstances, and no Stop Notice may be served unless 360 days
have elapsed since the delivery of any previous Stop Notice.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the ‘‘Standstill Period’’ is the period of 179 days after notice
has been given by the Trustee that an event of default under the notes or the Indenture has occurred
or that a payment default has occurred under the funding loan.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

_General_

The Notes Creditors may only take any Enforcement Action with respect to the High Yield
Security or on the funding loan if: (i) the prior written consent of the requisite majority of the Senior
Lenders is obtained; (ii) the Senior Lenders have accelerated the Obligors’ liabilities under the Senior
Credit Facilities, the Senior Lenders have declared the Obligors’ liabilities prematurely due and payable
(other than as a result of it becoming unlawful for a lender to perform its Obligations under the Senior
Credit Facilities), or the Senior Lenders have declared the liabilities thereunder payable on demand (in
which case the Notes Creditors may take the same Enforcement Action as the Senior Lenders have
taken but may not take any other Enforcement Action without the prior written consent of the
requisite majority of the Senior Lenders except after the Standstill Period expires); (iii) the Senior
Lenders have enforced or instructed the Security Agent to enforce any security from an Obligor in
respect of the liabilities owed by the Obligors, in which event Notes Creditors may take Enforcement
Action against that Obligor; (iv) the Notes Creditors have become entitled to take Enforcement Action
in respect of the Notes Liabilities as a result of the expiry of any Standstill Period (as defined below)
unless the relevant event of default under the Indenture to which the Standstill Period relates is no
longer continuing or has been waived or cured; or (v) the Notes Creditors are permitted to take
Enforcement Action in respect of the Notes Liabilities as a result of the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event (as described below).

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, ‘‘Enforcement Action’’ is defined to mean: (a) the
acceleration of any liabilities or any declaration that any liabilities are prematurely due and payable
(other than as a result of it becoming unlawful for a lender to perform its obligations under, or of any

133


-----

mandatory prepayment arising under, the Senior Credit Facilities) or payable on demand or the
premature termination or close out of certain hedging liabilities; (b) the notification by the Senior
Agent or the Trustee to the Security Agent of the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior
Credit Facilities or the Indenture, as appropriate, and of such Senior Agent’s or Trustee’s intention to
take steps to enforce or require the enforcement of any security; (c) the making of any demand against
a member of the Group in relation to any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in
respect of any liabilities or exercising any right to require any member of the Group to acquire any
liability (including exercising any put or call option against any member of the Group for the
redemption or purchase of any liability); (d) the exercise of any right of set-off against any member of
the Group in respect of any liabilities due and payable but unpaid; (e) the suing for, commencing or
joining of any legal or arbitration proceedings against any member of the Group to recover any
liabilities; (f) the entering into by any member of the Group of any composition, assignment or
arrangement with or for the benefit of its creditors generally (or any class thereof); (g) the petitioning,
applying or voting for, or the taking of any steps (including the appointment of any liquidator, receiver,
administrator or similar officer) in relation to, the winding up, dissolution, administration or
reorganisation of any member of the Group or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any
indebtedness of any member of the Group other than a reorganization permitted by the Senior Credit
Facilities, or any analogous procedure or step in any jurisdiction or (h) the taking of any steps by a
party (which such party is entitled to take) to enforce or require the enforcement of any security
(including the crystalization of any floating charge forming part of the security).

However, the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action: (i) the taking of any action falling
within paragraph (e) above necessary to preserve the validity and existence of claims, including the
registration of such claims before any court or governmental authority, (ii) to the extent entitled by law,
the taking of any actions against any creditor (or any agent, trustee or receiver acting on behalf of such
creditor) to challenge the basis on which any sale or disposal is to take place pursuant to powers
granted to such persons under any security documentation, or (iii) the Senior Lenders, the Notes
Creditors or a hedging counterparty bringing legal proceedings against any person in connection with
any securities violation or common law fraud or to restrain any actual or putative breach of the
Indenture and related documents for specific performance with no claim for damages; and provided
_further that none of the actions listed above in (i) through (iii) shall result in an Insolvency Event (as_
defined below).

_Enforcement of Security_

Upon the occurrence of any of the events set out above that would entitle the Notes Creditors to
take Enforcement Action in respect of Notes Liabilities, the Trustee may direct the Security Agent to
commence enforcement of the High Yield Security if, at that time, the event entitling the Trustee or
the holders of the notes to take the Enforcement Action is continuing, provided that:

  - if the Senior Lenders have taken or are taking reasonable efforts to implement an enforcement
sale or disposal of an asset subject to their security as expeditiously as reasonably practicable
having regard to the circumstances and following the end of the relevant Standstill Period and in
any event in accordance with the permitted enforcement provisions set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement and such enforcement sale or disposal is being implemented diligently, the Security
Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions of the Senior Lenders with respect to the sale
or disposal of such assets; and

  - if the Senior Lenders have commenced security enforcement action in relation to any asset or
assets (other than as set out in the previous bullet point), and such security enforcement action
is being pursued diligently, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions of
the Senior Lenders in relation to the enforcement of security in respect of the relevant asset or
assets.

134


-----

The Trustee is required to notify the Senior Agent and VDXK (or any successor company) of any
actions it takes pursuant to these provisions.

_Enforcement after occurrence of an Insolvency Event_

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Obligor, the Notes Creditors will be
entitled (in accordance with the Indenture) to exercise any right they may otherwise have in respect of
the Notes Liabilities of such Obligor to: (i) accelerate any Notes Liabilities or to declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand; (ii) make a demand under any guarantee,
indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any Notes Liabilities of that Obligor;
(iii) exercise any right of set off or take or receive any payment in respect of any Notes Liabilities;
(iv) claim and prove in the liquidation of that Obligor for the Notes Liabilities; or (v) take any other
Enforcement Action.

An ‘‘Insolvency Event’’ is defined by the Intercreditor Agreement to mean, in respect of an
Obligor: (a) the appointment of any administrator, receiver or other similar officer in respect of that
entity or any of its assets; (b) a petition is presented or meeting convened or application made to
appoint an insolvency administrator or similar officer, subject to certain conditions, (c) the declaration
of bankruptcy or granting of a suspension of payments, (d) an application is made for a declaration of
bankruptcy or the granting of suspension of payments, (e) an arrangement or composition with or any
assignment for the benefit of creditors generally, or the convening of any meeting for such purpose,
(f) convening a meeting for the purpose of considering a resolution for winding up or passing a
resolution for the winding up of such Obligor (other than certain frivolous petitions discharged within
21 days), and/or (g) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any applicable jurisdiction.

However, Notes Liabilities will remain subject to subordination in favor of obligations under the
Senior Credit Facilities as described under ‘‘—Subordination on Insolvency.’’

**_Subordination on Insolvency_**

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Obligor (or, with respect to
liabilities under the funding loan only, the issuer), the person responsible for the distribution of the
assets of that entity will be directed to pay any distributions in respect of any Notes Liabilities to the
Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement until the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities,
the Notes Liabilities and certain hedging liabilities have been paid in full.

To the extent that any of the Notes Liabilities is discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or
otherwise) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any lender that benefited from that set-off will
be required to pay (subject to the Trustee’s rights to indemnity and relevant certifications) an amount
equal to the amount of its liabilities discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions described below under ‘‘—Turnover’’ and ‘‘—Application of Proceeds.’’

After the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to any Obligor or the issuer (in respect of
the funding loan only), the Notes Creditors each irrevocably authorize the Security Agent to: (i) take
any Enforcement Action in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) demand,
sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of the relevant liabilities; (iii) collect and receive all
distributions on, or on account of, any or all of the relevant liabilities; and (iv) file claims, take
proceedings and do all other things the Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to recover such
liabilities.

**_Turnover_**

If, at any time when any obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are outstanding, and any
Notes Creditor receives or recovers (i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation
to, any of the Notes Liabilities which is not permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) any amount
by way of set-off in respect of any of such Notes Liabilities which does not give effect to a payment

135


-----

permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) the proceeds of any enforcement of the High Yield
Security except in accordance with the provisions described below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds,’’
or (iv) any distribution in cash or in kind made as a result of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in
respect of any Obligor, the Notes Creditor must hold that amount on trust for the Security Agent and
promptly pay that amount (less the costs and expenses of obtaining that receipt or recovery) to the
Security Agent (or, in certain circumstances, pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery (less the
costs and expenses of obtaining that receipt or recovery) to the Security Agent), provided that the
Trustee shall only be required to turn over any amount if (i) it has actual knowledge that such receipt
or recovery is required to be turned over and (ii) it has not distributed to holders of the Notes in
accordance with the Indenture any amounts so received or recovered, in each case to be held on trust
by the Security Agent for application in accordance with the order of priority described under
‘‘—Application of Proceeds.’’

**_Application of proceeds_**

All amounts from time to time received pursuant to the provisions described under ‘‘—Turnover’’
or otherwise or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities or
otherwise or in connection with the realization or enforcement of all or any part of the security in favor
of the Senior Credit Facilities and/or the High Yield Security or paid to the Senior Agent pursuant to
the provisions described under ‘‘—Turnover’’ or ‘‘—Release of Guarantees and Security’’ will be held
by the Security Agent on trust to apply them at any time the Security Agent sees fit, to the extent
permitted by applicable law (and subject to these provisions), in the following order of priority:

(i) in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent (in its capacity as trustee) or any receiver
or similar officer or any fees, expenses and indemnity payments to the Trustee (in an amount
not to exceed A3 million per annum only), on a pari passu basis;

(ii) in payment of all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Senior Agent, or the creditors
under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Notes Creditors and certain hedging creditors, in
connection with any realization or enforcement of the security in favor of the Senior Credit
Facilities and/or the High Yield Security taken in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or certain additional actions taken at the request of the Security
Agent;

(iii) in payment to the Senior Facility Agent on behalf of the Senior Lenders and certain hedging
counterparties for application (in accordance with the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities and
the relevant hedging agreements) towards the discharge of liabilities under the Senior Credit
Facilities and the hedging agreements, pro rata;

(iv) in payment to the Trustee on behalf of itself and of any amounts owing to the Trustee in
excess of such amounts paid pursuant to (i) above;

(v) in payment to the Trustee on behalf of the Notes Creditors for application (in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture) towards the discharge of the Notes Liabilities and the liabilities of
the issuer under the notes and the Indenture;

(vi) if none of the Obligors is under any further actual or contingent liability under the Senior
Credit Facilities, the hedging agreements or the Indenture, in payment to any person to whom
the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Obligor; and

(vii) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Obligor.

136

**_Release of Guarantees and Security_**

_Disposal Prior to Enforcement Action on Assets Other Than Shares_

The Security Agent is authorized to release the assets disposed of from the security in favor of the
Senior Credit Facilities and the notes and is authorized to execute or enter into, on behalf of and
without the need of any letter of authority from the Trustee or the holders of the notes, any release of
such security or any other claim over such assets that may, in the absolute discretion of the Security
Agent, be considered necessary or desirable if, prior to the commencement of any Enforcement Action
on any disposal permitted by the Senior Credit Facilities and the Indenture any sale, conveyance,
transfer or assignment of assets or any claim under an insurance policy which are the subject of the
such security (other than when such assets consist of shares), are permitted, and the terms of the
relevant instruments have been complied with.

_Disposal of Shares or Disposals Pursuant to Enforcement Action_

If all of the shares in the capital of an Obligor or any holding company of that Obligor are sold or
otherwise disposed of prior to an Enforcement Action or if any assets are sold or otherwise disposed of
by (or on behalf of) the Security Agent or by an Obligor at the request of the Security Agent (acting
on the instructions of or with the consent of the facility agent under the Senior Credit Facilities or the
Trustee, as applicable), either as a result of the enforcement of the security in favor of the Senior
Credit Facilities and/or the notes or a disposal by an Obligor after any Enforcement Action, the
Security Agent is authorized to release those assets from the guarantees and security in favor of the
Senior Credit Facilities and the notes and is authorized to execute or enter into, on behalf of and,
without the need for any further authority from any of the holders of the notes or the Trustee:

(i) except as set forth in (iii) below, any release of the guarantees and security in favor of the
Senior Credit Facilities or the notes or any other claim over that asset (including any claim of
contribution or subrogation by any other Obligor) that may, in the absolute discretion of the
Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of all of the shares (which are held by an Obligor) in
the capital of an Obligor owing Notes Liabilities to the Notes Creditors or liabilities to the
issuer under the notes or the Indenture, or any holding company of that Obligor, a release of
the Obligor or holding company from all (and not less than all) liabilities it may have to each
lender under the Senior Credit Facilities or the Indenture and to any other Obligor, both
actual and contingent in its capacity as a guarantor or borrower (including any liability to any
other Obligor by way of guarantee, contribution, subrogation or indemnity and including any
guarantee or liability arising under or in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities or the
Indenture) and a release of any security in favor of the Senior Credit Facilities or the notes
granted by that Obligor or holding company over any of its assets under any of the documents
creating such security, as applicable; and

(iii) provided that in the case of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group, taken
as a whole, or the shares (held by an Obligor) of an Obligor owing Notes Liabilities or
liabilities under the notes or the Indenture or related documentation, or any holding company
of that Obligor, all liabilities owed to all creditors of such Obligor that are party to the
Intercreditor Agreement have been released, and such sale unless permitted by the terms of
the Senior Credit Facilities and the Indenture shall be:

(a) implemented under any court approved process;

(b) made pursuant to a public auction; or

(c) for cash and in respect of which an internationally recognized investment bank has
delivered an opinion to the Trustee, that the amount received in connection with such

137


-----

sale is fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances
including the method of enforcement,

_provided that in the case of any sale or disposal under this paragraph, the proceeds of such sale or_
disposal are paid to the Security Agent to be held on trust by the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the order of priority described above under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ (such a sale
being referred to in this offering memorandum as a ‘‘Share Pledge Enforcement Sale’’).

The Notes Creditors shall execute any assignments, transfers, releases or other documents that the
Security Agent may consider to be necessary to give effect to these releases or disposals provided that
the proceeds of those disposals or claims are applied in accordance with the provisions described above
under described above under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds.’’

Pursuant to the Indenture, the guarantees will be released in certain additional, and wider,
circumstances, automatically and without the need for action on the part of the Trustee or the holders
of the notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Guarantees—Releases.’’

**_Subordination of Intercompany Liabilities_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the issuer and certain of its subsidiaries have agreed,
prior to the discharge of all liabilities and commitments under the Senior Credit Facilities, to
subordinate certain intercompany liabilities to the Senior Credit Facilities and also to the claims of
other creditors, including the holders of the notes and the Trustee. Pursuant to the Indenture, the
Trustee has agreed on behalf of itself and the holders of the notes that it will permit the payment,
prepayment, redemption, acquisition or defeasance of any such liabilities by giving consent to such
under the Intercreditor Agreement, if such payment, prepayment, redemption, acquisition or
defeasance would be in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, including the covenant described
under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

**_Subordination of Propco Liabilities_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities owed by Vendex KBB and its subsidiaries
to the Propcos but excluding liabilities in respect of the matters described under numbers (1) through
(4) under the caption ‘‘—Senior Credit Facilities—Covenants—Propco-related Covenants’’ above, are
subordinated to the prior discharge in full of liabilities incurred under the Senior Credit Facilities and
the notes.

**Mortgage Loan**

As part of the financing for the Acquisition, the Propcos entered into a A600 million senior
property facility with ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Bouwfonds Property Finance B.V., ING Bank N.V. and
ING Real Estate Finance N.V. as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners, ING Bank N.V. as facility
agent and ING Real Estate Finance N.V. as security agent.

**Mortgage Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of, among others, the lenders under the Mortgage Loan, the lenders
under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Propcos, and Vendex KBB and certain of its subsidiaries (the
‘‘Opcos’’), these parties entered into the Mortgage Intercreditor Agreement. Among other matters, the
Mortgage Intercreditor Agreement provides as follows:

   - the security agent on behalf of the finance parties under the Mortgage Loan, waives any rights
(other than in respect of the Rental Shortfall Guarantee or under any occupational lease (as
defined in the Mortgage Loan)) that such finance parties may have under or in connection with
the statements of liability (pursuant to section 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code (a ‘‘403

138


-----

statement’’)) that Vendex KBB issued in favor of the Propcos prior to the Acquisition (which
403 statements have since been withdrawn); and

  - upon certain insolvency or reorganization events or upon the enforcement of any security over
the shares in a Propco or over such Propco’s assets, liabilities incurred by a Propco to certain
Opcos are subordinated to liabilities incurred under the Mortgage Loan and the Senior Credit
Facilities, except for any such liabilities (1) arising under the Indemnity Agreement and (2) in
respect of loans of up to a maximum amount of A10 million made to the Propcos by the Opcos
to meet certain Propco capital expenditure requirements.

**Indemnity Agreement**

As a result of the reorganization of our property prior to the Acquisition, the Propcos or Opcos
may incur certain tax liabilities that would otherwise have been incurred by an Opco or a Propco,
respectively. In addition, as a result of the reorganization, a Propco may incur certain demerger,
employee and pension liabilities that would otherwise have been incurred by an Opco. As a condition
of each of the Mortgage Loan and the Senior Credit Facilities, the Propcos and Opcos, respectively,
have entered into the Indemnity Agreement pursuant to which (1) the Opcos and Propcos agree to
cross-indemnify each other with respect to certain tax liabilities and (2) the Opcos agree to indemnify
the Propcos in respect of certain demerger, employee and pension liabilities.

**Rental Shortfall Guarantee**

As part of the Property Transaction, Vendex KBB entered into a Rental Shortfall Guarantee with
certain of its operating company subsidiaries and the Propcos. Pursuant to the Rental Shortfall
Guarantee, Vendex KBB agrees to guarantee the due and punctual payment and discharge of any and
all obligations, undertakings and liabilities of its subsidiaries that are tenants of, and party to a lease
with, the Propcos. This guarantee comes into effect with respect to any such tenant only if Vendex KBB
withdraws its 403 statement in respect of that tenant.

terminate in August 2004. As of August 1, 2004, an aggregate of A9.5 million was outstanding.

**403 Statements**

In order to allow Vendex KBB not to publish financial statements for each of its subsidiaries and
instead provide consolidated accounts of the group, it issued in favor of its subsidiaries a corporate
guarantee in the form of a 403 statement (section 2:403 of the Dutch Civil Code) pursuant to which
Vendex KBB is jointly and severally liable with such subsidiary for generally all liabilities (excluding
tort, tax or criminal liabilities) arising from such subsidiary’s transactions.

Each of these 403 statements can be withdrawn, with respect to future liabilities only, at any time
following specific publicity measures prescribed by Dutch law. Vendex KBB withdrew its 403 statements
with respect to the Propcos on July 5, 2004. There are no significant liabilities recorded in the balance
sheets of the Propcos as of July 5, 2004. The aggregate contractual obligations of the Propcos as of
July 5, 2004 and for the entire life of the then outstanding contracts amounted to approximately
A17 million.

**Dutch Hybrid Instruments**

In July, 2004, Victoria Acquisition II B.V., the issuer’s direct parent (for purposes of this summary,
the ‘‘Subscriber’’), subscribed for an instrument issued by the issuer in connection with the Acquisition.
The current principal amount under this instrument is approximately A947 million (for purposes of this
summary, the ‘‘Acquisition DHI’’).

On or about September 30, 2004, the Subscriber subscribed to an instrument with a face value of
approximately A481 plus accrued interest (for purposes of this summary, the ‘‘Propco DHI’’), which
amount represents the face value of the note issued by VDXK when it acquired the lender’s rights
under Subordinated Propco Proceeds Loan from the Propcos. In consideration for the subscription of
the Propco DHI, the Subscriber assumed the rights and obligations under the Subordinated Propco
Proceeds Loan. See ‘‘The Acquisition, the Property Transaction and Related Transactions-The Property
Transaction.’’

Each of these instruments has substantially similar terms. The instruments provide for settlement
thirty years from date of issue and include provisions by which a yield or return may be provided on
the principal value of the relevant instrument at a rate determined at the discretion of the board of
managers of the issuer (the ‘‘Yield’’). Pursuant to the instruments, the Yield (if any) is payable at the
issuer’s option in cash or by issue of shares of the issuer. In addition, the Yield (if any) may be paid at
the discretion of the board of managers of the issuer and, if not paid, will accumulate. The instruments
require the issuer to make payments only to the extent that the issuer is not insolvent after making
such payment, the issuer has positive retained earnings and the payment is not prohibited by the
Intercreditor Agreement as described above under ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ The Propco DHI

140


-----

provides that amounts payable thereunder are limited to amounts received by the issuer from VDXK
on an instrument with substantially similar terms, which itself is limited in recourse to the proceeds of
any and all payments received.

At the settlement date or upon a liquidation of the issuer, the instruments provide that the
Subscriber will be entitled to be paid prior to any distribution of the issuer’s assets in respect of the
issuer’s ordinary shares. The issuer agrees not to commence a liquidation action without the prior
consent of the Subscriber unless any unpaid Yield can be paid.

The issuer covenants not to issue shares having, upon or following a liquidation of the issuer, any
right to payment prior to the instrument. For so long as any rights under the instrument are
outstanding, the issuer may not pay any dividends, nor redeem, purchase or make any payment in
relation to any ordinary shares of the issuer.

The instruments provide that they are subordinate to all other obligations of the issuer and
prohibit the Subscriber from taking enforcement action in respect of the instruments for so long as any
amount is owed to the Senior Lenders or the Notes Creditors.

In accordance with Dutch GAAP, we have classified the instruments as a form of equity. Although
for certain purposes under the Indenture these instruments will be considered as indebtedness,
throughout this offering memorandum we have described dutch hybrid instruments as a form of equity
consistent with Dutch GAAP. For more information on the treatment of the Acquisition DHI under
Dutch GAAP please see footnote 11 to the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the
issuer and related notes elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used in this description are defined below under the caption ‘‘—Certain
Definitions.’’ Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under the caption
‘‘—Certain Definitions’’ have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture (as defined below). In
this Description of the Notes, the ‘‘Issuer’’ refers to Victoria Acquisition III B.V. only, and not to its
Subsidiaries; ‘‘VDXK’’ refers to VDXK Acquisition B.V. (or any successor thereof following a Merger
Transaction) only, and not to its Subsidiaries; and ‘‘Guarantors’’ refers to the respective entities referred
to under ‘‘—Guarantees’’ and not to any of their respective Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating Rate Notes (together, the ‘‘Notes’’)
under an indenture among the Issuer, the Guarantors, The Bank of New York as Trustee and Principal
Paying Agent and Registrar, AIB/BNY Fund Management (Ireland) Limited as Irish Paying and
Transfer Agent, and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. as Security Agent (the ‘‘Indenture’’). We urge you to read
the Indenture because it, and not this description, defines your rights as a Holder. A copy of the
Indenture is available upon request to the Issuer at the address indicated under ‘‘Listing and General
Information.’’

The Issuer will initially issue in this offering the principal amount of Notes specified on the cover
of this offering memorandum. Subject to compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and
Preference Shares’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the Issuer may also
issue an unlimited amount of additional Notes at later dates under the same Indenture (‘‘Additional
_Notes’’). Any Additional Notes that the Issuer issues in the future will be identical in all respects to_
either the Fixed Rate Notes or the Floating Rate Notes that the Issuer is issuing now (including with
respect to Guarantees of, and Collateral securing, such Notes), except that Notes issued in the future
may have different issuance prices and will have different issuance dates.

All Notes, including any Additional Notes, will be treated as a single class under the Indenture,
including with respect to waivers and amendments, except as otherwise specified with respect to each
series of notes and in particular with respect to redemptions as further specified below. The Fixed Rate
Notes and the Floating Rate Notes will be distinguished by different security identification numbers.
Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this ‘‘Description of the
Notes,’’ references to the _‘‘Notes’’ include the Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes actually_
issued.

**The Notes**

The Notes will, upon issuance:

  - be general unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer, which is a holding company with no
operations and no material assets other than shares in VDXK (or, following a Merger
Transaction, shares in the successor to VDXK), and the Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan;

  - be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis pursuant to the Guarantees described below;

  - have the benefit of security in the form of the Share Pledges and the Proceeds Loan Pledge;

   - be effectively subordinated to all of the Indebtedness of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries, including
Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities; and

  - be the only Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than the Dutch Hybrid Instruments).

142


-----

**Principal Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue A million aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering, of
which A million will consist of the Floating Rate Notes and A million will consist of
the Fixed Rate Notes. Notes will be issued only in minimum denominations of A50,000 and integral
multiples of A1,000.

**_The Floating Rate Notes_**

The Floating Rate Notes will mature on, 2014 unless redeemed prior thereto as
described herein. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the ‘‘Floating Rate Notes’’ and the
Notes for all purposes of the Indenture and in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ include references to
any further Floating Rate Notes that are Additional Notes that are issued.

Each Floating Rate Note will bear interest at a rate per annum (the ‘‘Rate of Interest’’), reset
semi-annually, equal to EURIBOR plus %, as determined by the calculation agent (the
‘‘Calculation Agent’’), which shall initially be the Trustee. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be
payable semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on,
2005. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record of the Floating Rate Notes
on the immediately preceding and . Interest on the Floating Rate Notes
will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid,
from and including the Issue Date.

‘‘Determination Date’’, with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

‘‘EURIBOR’’, with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euros for a six-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Telerate Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m.,
Brussels time, on the Determination Date. If Telerate Page 248 does not include such a rate or is
unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of
each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to
provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately
11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank
market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a six-month period beginning on the day
that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered
quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such
quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each
of three major banks in London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate
(expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such
Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a
six-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination
Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic
mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period
will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

‘‘Euro-zone’’ means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the
euro.

‘‘Interest Period’’ means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with
the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on
and include the day before the first interest payment date.

143


-----

‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (a) A1,000,000 and (b) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time
Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

‘‘Telerate Page 248’’ means, the display page so designated on Bridge’s Telerate Service (or such
other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the
information vendor).

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each
Determination Date, determine the Rate of Interest and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable in respect of the following Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest Amount’’). The Interest Amount shall
be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest to the principal amount of each Floating Rate Note
outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual
number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure
upwards to the nearest available currency unit. The determination of the Rate of Interest and the
Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest
error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate
Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay Additional Amounts in cash on the
Notes as described below under ‘‘—Withholding Taxes.’’

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Note is not a Business Day at the place in which
such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due
until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or
other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_The Fixed Rate Notes_**

The Fixed Rate Notes will mature on unless redeemed prior thereto as described
herein. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the ‘‘Fixed Rate Notes’’ and the Notes for
all purposes of the Indenture and in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ include references to any further
Fixed Rate Notes that are Additional Notes that are issued.

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum, and will be
payable semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on,
2005, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding and . Interest on
the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the issue date thereof. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay Additional Amounts in cash on the
Fixed Rate Notes as described below under ‘‘—Withholding Taxes.’’

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Fixed Rate Note is not a Business Day at the
place in which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of
the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Listing of the Notes**

We have applied, through our listing agent, to list the Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange. The
Issuer can provide no assurance that its application will be accepted. The Issuer may also choose to list
on another recognized stock exchange.

-----

**Methods of Receiving Payment on the Notes**

Principal, premium, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined
below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents (as defined
below); provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more Global Notes
registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Clearstream Banking and/or Euroclear will be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders
thereof.

Principal, premium, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, on Definitive Registered Notes (as
defined below), if issued, will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying
Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be
paid by check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive
Registered Notes.

**Paying Agents and Registrars for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain a paying agent for the Notes (each, a ‘‘Paying Agent’’) in (i) London (the
_‘‘Principal Paying Agent’’) and (ii) Ireland (the ‘‘Irish Paying Agent’’), for so long as the Notes are listed_
on the Irish Stock Exchange and its rules so require. The initial Paying Agents will be The Bank of
New York in London and AIB/BNY Fund Management (Ireland) Limited in Dublin.

In addition, the Issuer will undertake to maintain a Paying Agent in a Member State of the
European Union that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to European Council Directive
2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the European Council of
Economics and Finance Ministers (‘‘ECOFIN’’) meeting of November 26–27, 2000 or any law
implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’), and a transfer agent in
each of London and, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and its rules so
require, Dublin. The initial Registrar will be The Bank of New York. The initial transfer agents will be
The Bank of New York in London. The Registrar and the transfer agents will maintain a register
reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes, if any, outstanding from time to time and will
make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes, if any, on behalf of the
Issuer. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

Upon notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change or add any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer
agent; provided, however, that in no event may the Issuer appoint a Principal Paying Agent in any
member state of the European Union where the Principal Paying Agent would be obliged to withhold
or deduct tax in connection with any payment made by it in relation to the Notes unless the Principal
Paying Agent would be so obliged if it were located in all other member states. For so long as the
Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and its rules so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of
any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Dublin (currently expected to be the _Irish Times) in accordance with the provisions set forth under_
‘‘—Notices.’’

**Transfer and Exchange**

Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under
the US Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (collectively, the ‘‘144A Global Notes’’). Notes sold outside the
United States pursuant to Regulation S under the US Securities Act will initially be represented by one
or more global Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the ‘‘Reg S

145


-----

_Global Notes’’). The 144A Global Notes and the Reg S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein_
as the ‘‘Global Notes.’’

The Notes in global form will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream Banking or its nominee. The Global Notes may be transferred only to another nominee of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking, to a successor of Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking and/or
to a nominee of such successor.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream Banking or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to
the restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully
under ‘‘Book-Entry; Delivery and Form—Transfers.’’ In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests
between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream Banking will be effected by Euroclear
or Clearstream Banking pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in a 144A Global Note, or the ‘‘144A Book-Entry Interests,’’ may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in a Reg S Global Note,
or the ‘‘Reg S Book-Entry Interests,’’ only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S under the US Securities Act. Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the
Notes, ownership of Reg S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have accounts with
Euroclear or Clearstream Banking or persons who hold interests through Euroclear or Clearstream
Banking, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be permitted during such
period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A. Subject to the foregoing, Reg S
Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Book-Entry Interests denominated in the same currency only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in
accordance with applicable transfer restrictions and any applicable securities laws of any state of the
United States or any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global
Note to which it is transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note
to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
A50,000 principal amount and integral multiples of A1,000, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream Banking, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest, if any, will, except as set
forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be
subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and
described more fully under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes, if any, may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
A50,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of A1,000. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things,

146


-----

furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account
of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates
and opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer
or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
taxes, duties and governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 calendar days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 calendar days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be
redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 calendar days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date;
or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

Immediately after issuance of the Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted
Subsidiaries except for Bijenkorf Vastgoed B.V., Bijenkorf Vastgoed II B.V., HEMA Vastgoed B.V.,
V&D Vastgoed B.V., and Mavoma B.V. (collectively, the ‘‘Propco Companies’’), which will be
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. In addition, in the circumstances described below under the ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ the Issuer will be permitted to designate Subsidiaries
as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Indenture.

The Propco Companies own 71 HEMA, Bijenkorf and V&D stores and three parking lots, and are
the borrowers under the Mortgage Loan described under ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness.’’ From
time to time, we may designate other Subsidiaries that are Unrestricted Subsidiaries to be Propco
Companies pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee.

**The Proceeds Loan**

The Issuer will use the proceeds of the Notes to fund the Proceeds Loan (which will have an
original principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes initially issued), which will be
made pursuant to a Proceeds Loan Agreement entered into between the Issuer and Koninklijke Vendex
KBB B.V. (‘‘Target’’). In the event that Additional Notes are issued, the Issuer will loan the proceeds
(an ‘‘Additional Proceeds Loan’’) to Target, under an additional proceeds loan agreement. In such an
event, the Additional Proceeds Loan will be pledged to the Security Agent on the same terms as are
described under ‘‘—Security—Proceeds Loan Pledge.’’ Unless the context otherwise requires, in this
Description of the Notes, the term ‘‘Proceeds Loan’’ will include any Additional Proceeds Loan.

Interest will accrue on the Proceeds Loan at a rate at least equal to the interest rate payable on
the Notes, with such adjustments as may be agreed between the parties or necessary to match any
additional amounts due thereunder, or any default or special interest payable with respect to the Notes.
Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Proceeds Loan is repayable at the same time
as the repayment or repurchase in full or in part of amounts due under or in respect of the Notes,
whether at maturity, on early redemption or mandatory repurchase or upon acceleration. Pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, Target and the Issuer have agreed that Target will only make payments on
the Proceeds Loan to the extent that the payment is a payment of scheduled interest (excluding default
interest) or any amount payable under any tax indemnity or increased costs provision or provisions for

147


-----

additional amounts or special interest or provisions for any costs, fees or expenses then due and
payable under the Notes or the Indenture or the Proceeds Loan, so long as such payment is not
prohibited by the payment blockage provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. See
‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

The Proceeds Loan will be subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Facilities and will be
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor
Agreement.’’ In addition, the Proceeds Loan may be subordinated to additional Indebtedness pursuant
to the provisions described under ‘‘—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

Pursuant to the Proceeds Loan, the Issuer has agreed that it will procure that, upon the
occurrence of a Merger Transaction involving Target, the resulting or surviving entity will assume the
obligations of Target under the Proceeds Loan.

**Guarantees**

The Guarantors will, jointly and severally, irrevocably guarantee (the ‘‘Guarantees’’), as primary
obligors and not merely as sureties, on a senior subordinated basis the full and punctual payment when
due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the Issuer
under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or in respect of
the Notes, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise. The Guarantors as of the date of the Indenture
will be VDXK and Target, each of which is a holding company, and the following, some of which are
operating subsidiaries, and some of which are intermediate holding companies: HEMA Belgi¨e B.V.,
M&S Mode Nederland B.V., Schaap en Citroen B.V., Vroom & Dreesmann Warenhuizen B.V., Vendex
KBB Speciaalzaken B.V., Vendex KBB Nederland B.V., Vendex KBB DIY Group B.V., M&S Mode
France B.V., M&S Mode International B.V., M&S Mode Spain B.V., Modehuizen Claudia Str¨ater B.V.,
Praxis Doe-het-Zelf Center B.V., Praxis Groep B.V., IMpact Retail B.V., IMpact Retail Holding B.V.,
KBB Buitenland B.V., Magazijn ‘‘De Bijenkorf’’ B.V., Dixons B.V., Formido Bouwmarkten B.V., HEMA
B.V., Hunkem¨oller B.V., Koninklijke Vendex KBB B.V., Divisie Bijenkorf B.V., Divisie HEMA B.V.,
Divisie Vroom & Dreesmann B.V. and VDXK Acquisition B.V. Together, the Guarantors include all of
the entities that have guaranteed the Senior Facilities. The ability to enforce the Guarantees is subject
to significant restrictions. See ‘‘—Subordination of the Guarantees.’’ In addition, the obligations of each
Guarantor will be limited as necessary under its Guarantee to prevent that Guarantee from constituting
a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable laws.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees.’’

The Guarantees will be:

   - senior subordinated obligations of the Guarantors;

  - pari passu in right of payment with all future Senior Subordinated Debt of the Guarantors; and

   - senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Guarantors.

Payment under the Guarantees will be expressly subordinated in right of payment to the payment
when due of all Senior Debt of the relevant Guarantor. As a result of this subordination, holders of
Senior Debt of any Guarantor will be entitled to receive full payment on all obligations owed to them
before any kind of payment can be made in respect of such Guarantor’s Guarantee to Holders. See
‘‘—Subordination of the Guarantees.’’

The Guarantors currently generate most of our revenue. As of August 1, 2004 and for the Last
12 Months, the subsidiaries of Vendex KBB that are Guarantors represented the following approximate
percentages of the adjusted EBITDA (as defined under ‘‘Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial
Information’’), assets and revenues of Vendex KBB (excluding the Propco Companies):

  - 74% of adjusted EBITDA;

148


-----

  - 81% of assets; and

  - 79% of revenues.

The Issuer may from time to time be required to procure the issuance of additional guarantees
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.’’ Any such guarantee (an _‘‘Additional_
_Guarantee’’) shall be issued on substantially the same terms as the Guarantees described hereunder,_
(including in relation to the release and subordination of such guarantees) and for the purposes of this
Description of the Notes the term ‘‘Guarantee’’ shall also include any such Additional Guarantees.

**_Releases_**

Any Guarantee shall be released:

(1) upon the sale of all the Share Capital of such Guarantor or any Holding Company thereof
pursuant to a Share Pledge Enforcement Sale;

(2) upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the Share Capital of the applicable
Guarantor (or any Holding Company of such Guarantor other than the Issuer or a Parent
Company of the Issuer) in compliance with the Indenture;

(3) upon the release of the guarantee or security that gave rise to the obligations to Guarantee the
Notes, so long as no other Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary is at that time
guaranteed or secured by such Guarantor in a manner which would require the granting of a
Guarantee; or

(4) the defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant
Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ in each case, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Indenture.

In addition, if a Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the
covenant entitled ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’, the relevant Guarantor
will be released from all its obligations under its Guarantee. In addition, upon the occurrence of a
Merger Transaction, the Guarantees of the merged entities will be replaced by a Guarantee of the
resulting or surviving entity.

In all cases the Issuer and such Guarantors that are to be released from their Guarantees shall
deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel certifying compliance with the
foregoing provisions. The Trustee shall take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

**_Subordination of the Guarantees_**

_General_

Each of the Guarantees is a senior subordinated guarantee, which means that each such Guarantee
ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Debt of each
Guarantor, including any obligations owed by such Guarantor under the Senior Facilities. The ability to
take enforcement action against the Guarantors under their Guarantees is subject to significant
restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement and the terms of the Guarantees, and potentially
any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date.

_Limitations on Paying the Guarantees_

The Guarantors are not permitted to make any payment in respect of principal of, premium, if
any, or interest on the Notes and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Notes (collectively,
‘‘pay the Guarantees’’) if either of the following occurs (a ‘‘Payment Default’’):

(1) a Payment Stop Event occurs with respect to the Senior Facilities; or

(2) if so specified in any other Designated Senior Debt, a Payment Stop Event occurs with respect to
such Designated Senior Debt,

unless, in either case, the Payment Default is no longer continuing or has been waived or cured or the
Obligations under the Senior Facilities or such Designated Senior Debt have been repaid in full and all
commitments under the Senior Facility or Designated Senior Debt have been cancelled. Regardless of
the foregoing, the Guarantors are permitted to pay the Guarantees if the Issuer and the Trustee receive
written notice consenting to such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Debt
(including the Senior Facilities) with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing.

During the continuance of any Payment Blockage Event under any Designated Senior Debt
(including the Senior Facilities), the Guarantors are not permitted to pay the Guarantees for a period
(a ‘‘Stop Period’’) commencing upon the issuance of written notice (a ‘‘Stop Notice’’) to the Trustee of
such default from the Representative of the lenders under the Designated Senior Debt for a period of
179 days from such issuance, unless a Standstill Period (as defined below) commences during such
179-day period, in which case (subject to the below), the Stop Period will be the period from the
issuance of the Stop Notice to the expiry of the Standstill Period. The Stop Period will end if:

(1) the default giving rise to such Stop Notice is no longer continuing or has been cured or waived;

(2) the requisite majority lenders under the Designated Senior Debt cancel the Stop Notice or consent
to such payment;

(3) all liabilities under such Designated Senior Debt have been repaid in full and all commitments
thereunder have been cancelled; or

(4) any applicable Standstill Period in effect at the time the Stop Notice was issued has expired and
the relevant Event of Default under (and as referred to in) the Indenture to which the Standstill
Period relates is still continuing or has not been waived or cured.

Notwithstanding the provisions described above, unless the holders of such Designated Senior Debt
or the Representative of such Designated Senior Debt have accelerated the maturity of such
Designated Senior Debt, the Guarantors will be permitted to resume paying the Guarantees after the
end of such Stop Period. No Stop Notice may be served by the Representative of the lenders under the
Designated Senior Debt more than 45 days after the Representative of such Designated Senior Debt
receives notice in writing specifying the occurrence constituting that Stop Event, and no more than one
Blockage Notice may be served with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. Also, no Stop
Notice may be served unless 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of any previous Stop Notice in
any consecutive 360-day period, irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated
Senior Debt during such period.

The Trustee, on behalf of the Holders, has agreed to a 179-day standstill period (the ‘‘Standstill
_Period’’) on enforcement actions it could otherwise take against the Guarantors in respect of the Notes,_
their respective Guarantees or the Indenture for an Event of Default. The Standstill Period begins on
the date the Trustee gives a notice of a Default to the Senior Facility Agent under the Senior Facilities
(and if applicable, the Representative under any other Designated Senior Debt), and the Trustee may
take enforcement actions upon its expiry unless the relevant Event of Default under the Indenture is

150


-----

no longer continuing or has been cured or waived. The Standstill Period may end earlier in the
circumstances described under ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

Notwithstanding the existence or duration of any Payment Stop Event, Standstill Period, Stop
Notice or Stop Period, the Guarantors will nevertheless be entitled to pay and the Trustee shall be
entitled to receive and retain amounts which are for its own account by way of expenses, fees, costs or
by way of indemnity or remuneration pursuant to the Indenture.

_Subordination on Insolvency_

In the event of the opening of insolvency proceedings under Dutch law over the assets of the
Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, an insolvency administrator will be appointed.

Under Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the
proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors on the basis of the relative claims of those creditors.
Certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social security authorities) will have special
rights that may adversely affect the interests of Holders. For example, secured creditors may enforce
their rights against assets of the Issuer and/or the Guarantors to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. Consequently, Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your
potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding. As in moratorium of payments proceedings, the
court may order a ‘‘cooling down period’’ for a maximum of two months (or four months in the near
future) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred. The claim of a creditor may
be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms.
Generally, claims of the Holders which were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a
bankruptcy of the issuer and/or the Guarantors, will be accelerated and become due and payable as of
that date. Each of these claims will have to be submitted to the receiver of the Issuer and the
Guarantors to be verified. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value
of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be admitted in the bankruptcy proceeding. The
valuation of claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy
proceeding may be based on a net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date
of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatie-vergadering) the
receiver, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other
creditors. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors meeting may be
referred to a separate court proceeding (renvooi procedure). These renvooi procedures could cause
Holders to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a
US liquidation. Such renvooi procedures could also cause payments to the Holders to be delayed
compared with holders of undisputed claims. Further, in a bankruptcy a composition may be offered to
creditors, which may be binding on creditors in the same manner as set forth above in relation to a
moratorium. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors.
A contractual subordination of the Guarantees in respect of certain other indebtedness of the Issuer
and/or the Guarantors will be given effect, as much as possible under Dutch law, in accordance with
such contract terms.

A receiver in bankruptcy can force the secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a
reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any,
and the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs. Excess proceeds of enforcement
must be returned to the issuer in its insolvency; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of
the secured creditor on the issuer. Such set-off is allowed prior to the Issuer’s insolvency.

Simultaneously with the opening of the Issuer’s bankruptcy proceeding a Dutch receiver or
administrator will be appointed. Such appointment will have an overriding effect on the appointment of
a receiver as set out in the relevant security documents. The appointment of such receiver cannot
prevent the Issuer from being declared bankrupt in The Netherlands. Any future rights or assets

151


-----

acquired by the Issuer after it has been declared bankrupt or after it has been granted a moratorium of
payments will not be subject to the security interests created by the relevant security documents.

Please see the section entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—
Dutch insolvency laws to which we are subject may not be as favorable to you as United States or other
insolvency laws.

_Subordination on the basis of Intercreditor Agreements_

In general, unless otherwise permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement:

(1) the lenders under the Senior Facilities will be entitled, as secured lenders and pursuant to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to payment in full of all amounts outstanding under the
Senior Facilities before (i) the Trustee and the Holders would be entitled to payments under a
Guarantee from any Guarantor and (ii) the Issuer would be entitled to payments under the
Proceeds Loan and, as a result, before Holders would ultimately receive any payments on the
Notes;

(2) the Trustee and the Holders will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to turn over any amounts they receive in respect of a Guarantee to the Security Agent
until all obligations outstanding under the Senior Facilities are paid in full, provided that the
Trustee shall only be required to turn over any amount if (i) it has actual knowledge that such
receipt or recovery is required to be turned over and (ii) it has not distributed to Holders in
accordance with the Indenture any amount so received or recovered; and

(3) the Issuer will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to turn over any
amounts it receives under the Proceeds Loan to the Security Agent until all amounts outstanding
under the Senior Facilities are paid in full.

The Security Agent will be directed to apply such amounts in the manner described under
‘‘—Turnover and Application of Proceeds.’’ See also ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—
Intercreditor Agreement.’’

In addition, to the extent that a Guarantor incurs additional Senior Debt, such Senior Debt will be
entitled to similar seniority in right of payment to such Guarantor’s Guarantee and may also have the
benefit of an Additional Intercreditor Agreement giving effect to such seniority.

_Turnover and Application of Proceeds_

If, at any time when any Senior Debt of any Guarantor is or may be outstanding, the Trustee or
any Holder receives or recovers (i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to,
any liabilities under the Guarantees which is not permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) any
amount by way of set-off in respect of any of such liabilities which does not give effect to a payment
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) the proceeds of any enforcement of the Share Pledges
or the Proceeds Loan Pledge except in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
relating to the application of proceeds received by the Security Agent, or (iv) any distribution in cash
or in kind made as a result of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of any obligor under
the Senior Facilities, the Trustee or such Holder, as the case may be, will to the extent possible under
applicable law hold that amount on trust (to the extent possible under applicable law) for the Security
Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent (or, in certain circumstances, pay an
amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent), in each case to be held on trust by the
Security Agent (to the extent permitted by applicable law) for application in accordance with the order
of priority specified in the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that the Trustee shall only be required to
turn over any amount if (i) it has actual knowledge that such receipt or recovery is required to be
turned over and (ii) it has not distributed to Holders in accordance with the Indenture any amount so

152


-----

received or recovered. This order of priority requires that all obligations under the Senior Facilities be
fully discharged before any amounts may be distributed in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees. See
‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

In addition, the terms of future Senior Debt may require similar turnover provisions in favor of
such Senior Debt, which may be entered into without the consent of the Trustee or the Holders
pursuant to the provisions described under ‘‘—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’ In such a case,
the relevant Representative of such Senior Debt would be able to require that amounts which would
otherwise have been paid to the Trustee or the Holders be paid instead to such Representative of or
the lenders under such Senior Debt.

Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, holders of Senior Debt and other creditors
(including trade creditors) of a Guarantor may recover disproportionately more than the Holders
recover in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding relating to such Guarantor. In such a case, there may be
insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes.

Payments by the Issuer from the money or the proceeds of securities held in any defeasance trust
pursuant to the provisions described under ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ will
generally not be subject to the subordination provisions described above. However, the terms of the
Senior Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement would generally prevent the establishment of any
such defeasance trust without the consent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities.

Please see the sections entitled ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Us and Our Business,’’ ‘‘—Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees,’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness.’’

**Security**

**_General_**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and the Guarantors under the
Indenture will be secured by:

(1) a second priority security interest in the shares of VDXK and of Target created by pledge
agreements (as amended from time to time, the ‘‘Share Pledges’’) entered into by the Issuer and
VDXK; and

(2) a second priority security interest in all of the Issuer’s rights under the Proceeds Loan Agreement
and any Additional Proceeds Loan Agreement, created by a pledge agreement entered into by the
Issuer and Target (together with any Additional Proceeds Loan Pledge, the ‘‘Proceeds Loan Pledge’’
and, together with the Share Pledges, the ‘‘Security’’).

The shares subject to the Share Pledges, together with any other property, proceeds or rights that
may be added to, supplement or replace such shares in accordance with the terms of the Pledge
Agreement and the Indenture are referred to as the ‘‘Share Collateral,’’ and the Issuer’s rights under
the Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Additional Proceeds Loan Agreement that have been pledge
pursuant to the Proceeds Loan Pledge are referred to as the ‘‘Loan Collateral,’’ and, together with the
Share Collateral, the ‘‘Collateral.’’

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain
Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the Issuer is permitted to pledge the Collateral in
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including
any Additional Notes, permitted under the Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority
of such Indebtedness. The Security will be released upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes as
provided in ‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ in
each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture, and as further described
below under ‘‘—Releases.’’

153


-----

**_Priority_**

The relative priority between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities and (b) the Trustee and
the Holders under the Indenture with respect to the Security is established by the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Share Pledges and the Proceeds Loan Pledges, which
provide that:

(i) the obligations under the Senior Facilities will be secured by a first priority interest in the
Share Collateral and the Loan Collateral; and

(ii) the obligations under the Notes and the Indenture will be secured by a second priority interest
in the Share Collateral and a second priority security interest in the Loan Collateral.

Please see the sections entitled ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’
and ‘‘—Enforcement of Security.’’ In addition, pursuant to any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See
‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

**_Share Pledges_**

Under the Share Pledges, the Issuer will pledge the Share Collateral to secure the payment and
performance when due of the Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Indenture.

The Share Pledges will be entered into between the Issuer and VDXK, as Pledgors, and the
Security Agent under share pledge agreements. When entering into the Share Pledges, the Security
Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the Holders from time to time. As a matter of
Dutch law it is only possible to grant security in favor of a party who is also the creditor of the
monetary obligations expressed to be secured by such security. In view of this requirement, a parallel
payment obligation has been created in favor of the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement and it is this obligation which is secured by the Share Pledge. The parallel payment
obligation is restricted in such a way that it does not increase the net payment obligations of the
relevant pledgor. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the
lenders under the Senior Facilities in relation to the security in favor of such lenders.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Notes and the
Indenture will be secured by a second priority interest in the Share Collateral until all Obligations
under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, please see the section entitled
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees.’’

The Share Pledges are governed by Dutch law and provide that the rights with respect to the
Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and in respect of the
entire outstanding amount of the Notes. The Indenture also provides that the Share Pledges may only
be enforced upon an acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default.
Since the Holders are not party to the Share Pledges, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take
any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Share Pledges. The Holders may only
act to enforce the Share Pledges through the Security Agent.

**_Proceeds Loan Pledge_**

The obligations under the Notes and the Indenture also will be secured by a security interest
(which will rank behind a security interest granted in favor of the lenders under the Senior Facilities) in
the Loan Collateral. The Proceeds Loan Pledge has been granted in favor of the Security Agent and is
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. As with the Share Pledges, the Proceeds Loan Pledge secures
obligations in favor of the Security Agent under the parallel payment obligation included in the

154


-----

Intercreditor Agreement. The Proceeds Loan Agreement and the Proceeds Loan Pledge will be
governed by Dutch law.

In the event that the lenders under the Senior Facilities enforce their first priority security interest
with respect to the Proceeds Loan Agreement (or another holder of Indebtedness which is secured by a
security interest in the Proceeds Loan enforces such security interest), the Issuer’s rights under the
Proceeds Loan Agreement may be assigned to a third party. This would mean that the Issuer would
have no right, title or interest in the Loan Collateral and no claims against Target under the Proceeds
Loan Agreement.

As with the Share Pledges, the rights under the Proceeds Loan Pledge with respect to the Notes,
the Guarantees and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent and in respect of the entire
outstanding amount of the Notes, and the Proceeds Loan Pledge may only be enforced upon an
acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes following an Event of Default. Since the Holders are
not party to the Proceeds Loan Pledge, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct
action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Proceeds Loan Pledge. The Holders may only act
to enforce the Proceeds Loan Pledge through the Security Agent.

**_Releases_**

Each of the Share Pledges and the Proceeds Loan Pledge will be released (a) prior to the
occurrence of a Default under the Indenture or a default under any other Indebtedness secured by
such Security, in a transaction that (i) complies with the applicable provisions of the Indenture
including ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,’’ ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or
Substantially All Assets’’ and (ii) pursuant to which all holders of Senior Debt (including the lenders
under the Senior Facilities) have released their lien on the Collateral that is subject to such Share
Pledge or Proceeds Loan Pledge, or (b) following a Default under the Indenture or a default under any
other Indebtedness secured by such shares, pursuant to a Share Pledge Enforcement Sale so long as
the proceeds of such sale are applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Description
of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ In the event of a Merger Transaction, any Share
Pledge may be replaced by a Share Pledge with respect to interests in the resulting or surviving entity.

In addition, a refinancing of the Senior Facilities could be implemented in a manner that releases
the first-priority security interest over all or some of the Collateral. If this were to occur, by operation
of Dutch law, the Security in favor of the Notes would gain priority over later-granted security in favor
of the refinanced indebtedness, which could preclude the possibility of putting in place a new senior
facility with first priority security as part of the refinancing. To avoid this outcome, the Indenture and
the security documents for the Notes will provide that, upon a release of the first-priority security in
connection with such a refinancing, the Security in favor of the Notes will be automatically released.
The Indenture and the Security will also provide that the Security will be replaced by new security in
favor of the Notes, on substantially the same terms as prior to release. However, under Dutch law, the
new security would be unenforceable if the grantor was insolvent at the time that it was granted.

The Security will be released upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in
‘‘—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ in each case, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture. The Security will permit a Merger
Transaction, a Permitted Reorganization or the conversion of Target or VDXK or their successors into
a different corporate form. The Security may also be released to the extent required in order to enter
into a new intercreditor agreement, in accordance with the provisions described under ‘‘—Additional
Intercreditor Agreements,’’ which creates a new parallel debt obligation in favor of the Security Agent,
_provided that the new parallel debt obligation is secured with the same Security._

155


-----

**_Enforcement of Security_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security and provide for the release of the Security in certain circumstances upon
enforcement by the lenders under the Senior Facilities. These limitations are described under
‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’

In general the rights of the Trustee or the Holders are subject to certain standstill provisions and
other limitations on enforcement; while these provisions are in effect, only the lenders under the Senior
Facility may direct the sale of the Security and the Trustee may not otherwise take enforcement action.

If the Trustee or any Holder receives proceeds of any enforcement of the Security while the
obligations under the Senior Facilities are outstanding, the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, will,
subject to certain exceptions, turn over such amounts to the Security Agent to be applied in the order
described under ‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Turnover’’ and
‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement—Application of Proceeds.’’

Similar provisions may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in
compliance with ‘‘—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**Ranking**

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and will rank equal in right of payment with all
of the Issuer’s existing and future unsubordinated obligations. The Notes will rank senior to any of the
Issuer’s existing or future Subordinated Indebtedness.

The Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating operations of its own. In order to
make payments on the Notes or meet other obligations, it will be dependent upon receiving payments
from Target under the Proceeds Loan or from VDXK in the form of dividends or otherwise. These
payments are restricted by the Intercreditor Agreement and may be restricted by Additional
Intercreditor Agreements in the future.

The Guarantees will be senior subordinated obligations of the Guarantors. Each Guarantee will
rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Debt of such Guarantor and equal in
right of payment with all existing and future Senior Subordinated Debt of such Guarantor. Each
Guarantee will rank senior to any existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor.

Other than pursuant to intercompany claims (which in certain cases are subject to subordination
under Dutch law and are subject to subordination pursuant to our intercreditor arrangements or
otherwise), we only have a shareholder’s claim in the assets of our subsidiaries. This shareholder’s claim
is junior to the claims that creditors of our Subsidiaries have against our Subsidiaries. Holders will only
be creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In the case of Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, all
the existing and future liabilities of these subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors and
preferred stockholders, will be effectively senior to the Notes. These Subsidiaries may include entities
that are borrowers or guarantors under the Senior Facilities.

As of August 1, 2004, after giving pro forma effect to this offering and the application of the net
proceeds therefrom as described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds:’’

  - the Issuer had no Indebtedness other than that represented by the Notes and the Dutch Hybrid
Instruments; and

156


-----

   - the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have had a total of A954.9 million of
Indebtedness (including under the Senior Facilities, but excluding the Dutch Hybrid
Instruments).

The Issuer and its Subsidiaries may have other liabilities, including contingent liabilities, that may
be significant. In addition, the Issuer’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries had, as of August 1, 2004, an
additional A600.0 million of indebtedness. The Indenture contains limitations on the amount of
additional Indebtedness that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur. However, the
amounts of this Indebtedness or other liabilities incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
could nevertheless be substantial and may be Incurred either by Guarantors or by Subsidiaries that are
not Guarantors such that the Notes and Guarantees would effectively rank junior to such Indebtedness
or other liabilities. The Indenture does not place restrictions on the amount of Indebtedness that may
be incurred by the Issuer’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

In addition, claims under the Guarantees are restricted by applicable laws and may be limited in
value. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and the Guarantees.’’ In the event that a
Guarantee was found to be limited in value or invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then the Holders
would not have a direct claim except to the extent of such enforceability and would otherwise be
effectively subordinated to all of the Indebtedness and other liabilities of such Guarantor.

Other secured Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Indebtedness under the
Senior Facilities (which has a prior Lien on the Collateral securing the Notes), will be effectively senior
to the Notes to the extent that this Indebtedness has a prior Lien on the Collateral securing the Notes
or a lien on other property that is not Collateral that secures the Notes. In either of these cases, the
other secured Indebtedness will be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the
assets securing the other secured Indebtedness or the amount of the other secured Indebtedness,
whichever is less. The Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries have the ability to incur significant amounts
of additional Indebtedness which is secured, including Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on the
Collateral that are prior to the Security in favor of the Notes or which share in the Collateral on a pari
_passu basis with the Notes. See ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’ In addition,_
in the event that Additional Notes are issued, the Security in favor of the Notes under the Share
Pledges will be shared among a larger principal amount of Indebtedness.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Redemption—Floating Rate Notes_**

At any time or from time to time on or prior to, the Issuer may, at its option,
redeem up to 40% in principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes (the ‘‘Redemption Amount’’) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a premium equal to the Rate of
Interest per annum on the Floating Rate Notes applicable on the date on which notice of redemption
is given or, at the Issuer’s election as specified in its notice of redemption, if notice of redemption is
given after the determination by the Calculation Agent of the Rate of Interest for a subsequent Interest
Period but before such subsequent Interest Period commences, such Rate of Interest for such
subsequent Interest Period, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to
such redemption date, with the net proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date); provided that at least 60% in principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes originally issued
remains outstanding immediately after each such redemption. Each such redemption shall occur within

157


-----

120 days of the closing of the relevant Equity Offering. Any redemption notice given in respect of such
redemption may be given prior to completion of the related Equity Offering, and any such redemption
or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, including but not limited to the completion of the related Equity Offering.

At any time or from time to time on and after, the Issuer may redeem the Floating
Rate Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice delivered to each
Holder pursuant to the procedures described below under ‘‘—Notices’’ at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) if
the Floating Rate Notes are redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on in
the years indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent.

If less than all the Floating Rate Notes will be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Floating Rate
Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under ‘‘—Notices’’ below.

**_Redemption—Fixed Rate Notes_**

At any time or from time to time on or prior to, 2007, the Issuer may, at its option,
redeem up to 40% in principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes (the ‘‘Redemption Amount’’) at a
redemption price equal to % of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, to such redemption date, with the net proceeds of one
or more Equity Offerings (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that at least 60% in principal
amount of the Fixed Rate Notes originally issued remains outstanding immediately after each such
redemption. Each such redemption shall occur within 120 days of the closing of the relevant Equity
Offering. Any redemption notice given in respect of such redemption may be given prior to completion
of the related Equity Offering, and any such redemption or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be
subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the
completion of the related Equity Offering.

At any time or from time to time prior to, 2008, the Issuer may redeem the Fixed
Rate Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice delivered to each
Holder pursuant to the procedures described below under ‘‘—Notices,’’ at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium plus accrued and unpaid interest,
and Additional Amounts, if any, to such redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Any such
redemption and notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent.

At any time or from time to time on and after, 2008, the Issuer may redeem the
Fixed Rate Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice delivered to
each Holder pursuant to the procedures described below under ‘‘—Selection and Notice,’’ at the
redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to the applicable redemption date (subject to

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent.

If less than all the Fixed Rate Notes will be redeemed, the Trustee will select the Fixed Rate
Notes to be redeemed in the manner described under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’ below.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem all but not part of the Fixed Rate Notes and/or the Floating
Rate Notes, at any time upon giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice to the Holders at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and
all Additional Amounts (see ‘‘—Withholding Taxes’’), if any, then due and which will become due on
the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer or any Guarantor
determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation which
becomes effective on or after the Issue Date; or

(2) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction), which change in position becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (each of the
foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

the Payer (as defined below under ‘‘—Witholding Taxes’’) is, or on the next interest payment date in
respect of such series of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts, and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to it.

In the case of a Guarantor that becomes a party to the Indenture after the Issue Date or a
successor person, the Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date that such entity (or
another Payer organized or resident in the same jurisdiction) first makes payment on the Notes. In the
case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of a Payer conducting business in an
Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below), the Change in Tax Law must become effective after
the date the Payer begins to conduct the business giving rise to the relevant withholding or deduction.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
under ‘‘—Notices.’’

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days
prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, would be obliged to
make such payment of Additional Amounts or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or a
Guarantee, as the case may be, were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such
obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any

159


-----

notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver an Officer’s
Certificate to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer cannot avoid the obligations to pay Additional
Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it. The Issuer will also deliver to the Trustee an
opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer or a
Guarantor, as the case may be, has been or shall become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as
a result of (1) or (2) above. Absent manifest error, the Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient existence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which
event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer on the Notes or by any Guarantor under the Guarantees or by a
successor of any of the foregoing (each a ‘‘Payer’’) will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
assessments or other governmental charges (including penalties, interest and other liabilities related
thereto) (collectively ‘‘Taxes’’) imposed or levied by or on behalf of (1) the jurisdiction where such
Payer is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, (2) any jurisdiction from
or through which the Payer makes a payment on the Notes or the Guarantee, or (3) any political
subdivision or governmental authority of or in any of the foregoing having the power to tax (the
‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by
law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes of any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction is at any time required in respect of any payments under the Notes or the Guarantee, the
Payer will pay to each Holder of a Note such additional amounts (‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts (including Additional Amounts) paid to such Holder will not
be less than the amounts which such Holder would have received in respect of such payments in the
absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, that the Payer will not be required to make any
payment of Additional Amounts for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes which would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between such Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such Holder or beneficial owner, if such
Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation)
and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including such Holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary,
settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident
thereof or being or having been present or engaged in a trade or business therein or having or
having had a permanent establishment therein, but excluding, in each case, any connection arising
solely from the acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Notes or the receipt of any payment
in respect thereof or the exercise or enforcement of any rights under the Indenture or the Notes;

(2) any Taxes which would not have been imposed but for the presentation of a Note (where
presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after (i) the date on which such
payment became due and payable or (ii) the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for,
whichever occurs later;

(3) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or
other similar governmental charge;

(4) any Taxes which are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payment of (or in
respect of) principal of, premium, if any, or any interest on, the Notes;

(5) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payer addressed to the Holder (and
made at a time which would enable the Holder and/or beneficial owner acting reasonably to
comply with that request) made in accordance with the procedures described in ‘‘—Notices’’

160


-----

hereinafter to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the
nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any
declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) except in the case of the liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of the Payer, any tax,
assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for the
presentation of a Note for payment (where presentation is required) in the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (unless by reason of the Payer’s actions, presentment could not have been made
elsewhere);

(7) any Taxes that are required to be withheld or deducted on a payment to an individual and required
to be made pursuant to the European Union Directive on the taxation of savings income (the
‘‘Directive’’) which was adopted by the ECOFIN Council of the European Union on June 3, 2003,
or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to the Directive;

(8) any Taxes which could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) of
the relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union; or

(9) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable where, had the beneficial owner of the Note
been the Holder, it would not have been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of
clauses (1) to (9) inclusive above.

If the Payer will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on the
Notes, the Payer will provide to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to that payment date, in which
case the Payer shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary
to enable the Principal Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment
date. The Issuer will provide the Trustee with documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
evidencing the payment of Additional Amounts. The Trustee shall, without more, be entitled to rely
absolutely on each such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, will (i) make such withholding or deduction and
(ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with
applicable law. The Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, will use all reasonable efforts to obtain
certified copies of tax receipts (or, if such certified copies are not available using reasonable efforts,
such other evidence reasonably acceptable to the Trustee) evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such
evidence of payment to each holder of a Note in accordance with the procedures described in
‘‘—Notices’’ hereunder. The Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, will attach to each certified copy a
certificate stating (x) that the amount of such Tax evidenced by the certified copy was paid in
connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the
amount of such withholding Tax paid per A1,000 of principal amount of the Notes. The preceding
provisions set forth in the first paragraph above will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which
any successor person is organized or otherwise considered to be resident for tax purposes and any
political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein.

The Indenture will further provide that if the Payer conducts business in any jurisdiction (an
‘‘Additional Taxing Jurisdiction’’) other than a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and, as a result, is required
by the law of such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction to withhold or deduct any amount on account of

161


-----

Taxes imposed by such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction from payments under the Notes or any
Guarantee, as the case may be, which would not have been required to be so withheld or deducted but
for such conduct of business in such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the Additional Amounts provision
described above shall be considered to apply as if references in such provision to ‘‘Taxes’’ included
taxes imposed by way of withholding or deduction by any such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction (or any
political subdivision thereof or therein), and that such Additional Taxing Jurisdiction shall be treated as
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction for the purposes of the ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’ provisions
hereof.

The Payer will pay any present or future stamp, transfer, court or documentary taxes or any other
excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies or Taxes which arise from the execution, delivery or
registration of any Notes or any other document or instrument referred to therein (other than a
transfer of the Notes), or any stamp, court or documentary taxes (or similar charges or levies) imposed
with respect to the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes or Guarantees, excluding any
such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction, other than those resulting from, or required to be paid in connection with, the
enforcement of the Notes, the Guarantees or any other such document or instrument following the
occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

All references in this offering memorandum to principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Notes (including payments thereof made pursuant to the Guarantee) will include any Additional
Amounts payable by the Payer in respect thereof.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms described under this caption ‘‘—Change of
Control,’’ each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all of such Holder’s Notes
at a price in cash (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment’’) equal to 101% (in the case of the Fixed Rate
Notes) or 100% (in the case of the Floating Rate Notes) of the aggregate principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date).

No later than the date which is 30 days after a Change of Control, the Issuer will give notice (the
‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the
Change of Control and offering to purchase all Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date
specified in the notice given to the Holders in compliance with the procedures described below under
‘‘—Selection and Notice.’’ If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and
the rules of that exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a copy of such notice in a newspaper of
general circulation in Dublin (which is expected to be the Irish Times). Such notice shall contain the
following information:

(1) a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled ‘‘Repurchase at the
_Option of the Holders—Change of Control,’’ and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such_
Change of Control Offer will be accepted for purchase;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than
60 days from the date such notice is given (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’);

(3) any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

162


-----

(4) unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted
for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change
of Control Payment Date;

(5) Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender the Notes, with the form entitled ‘‘Option of Holder to Elect Purchase’’ on
the reverse of the Notes completed, to the Principal Paying Agent at the address specified in the
notice or to the Paying Agent at its office in Dublin prior to the close of business on the third
Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; provided, however, that in relation
to any Book Entry Interest, a holder of such Book Entry Interests may exercise its option to have
such Book Entry Interest purchased through the facilities of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
Banking, as applicable, in each case, subject to their rules and regulations;

(6) Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer
to purchase such Notes if the Principal Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of business
on the last day of the Offer Period (as defined in the Indenture), a telegram, telex, facsimile
transmission or letter setting forth the name of such Holder, the principal amount of Notes
tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his tendered Notes and
his election to have such Notes purchased; and

(7) if applicable, a Holder whose Definitive Registered Notes are being purchased in part will be
issued new Definitive Registered Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of
the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must have a minimum principal amount of
A50,000 and be an integral multiple of A1,000.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the US
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations, including any securities laws of the
Netherlands, to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of
the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer
will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent, prior to 10.00 a.m. London time, an amount equal to the
aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered;

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate setting forth the Notes or
portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control
Offer;

(4) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect
thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased
by the Issuer; and

(5) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered
Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

The Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes
properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly
authenticate and mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in principal

163


-----

amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered; provided that each such new Note will
be in a principal amount that is at least A50,000 and an integral multiple of A1,000. The Issuer will
publicly announce (in accordance with the provisions described below under ‘‘—Selection and Notice’’)
the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control
Payment Date.

The provisions described above that require the Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer will be
applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable unless notice of
redemption has been given in respect of all of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture
described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption.’’

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer in relation to a series of Notes
if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer
made by the Issuer in relation to such series of Notes and purchases all Notes properly tendered and
not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Nevertheless, the existence of a
Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer, its Subsidiaries or a
Holding Company of the Issuer in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Change of Control repurchase feature is a result of negotiations between us and the Initial
Purchasers. Management has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of
Control, although it is possible that we would decide to do so in the future. Subject to certain
covenants described below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of debt outstanding at such time or otherwise
affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, transfer, assignment,
lease, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of our assets. Although there is a
developing body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ and although we have clarified
in the definition whether certain events would or would not constitute a disposal of ‘‘substantially all’’
of our assets, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly,
if we dispose of less than all our assets by any of the means described above, the ability of a holder of
Notes to require us to repurchase its Notes may be uncertain. In such a case, Holders may not be able
to resolve this uncertainty without resorting to legal action.

The Senior Facilities require, and future Indebtedness of the Issuer and/or its Subsidiaries may
require, the Issuer and/or its Subsidiaries to repay or repurchase such other Indebtedness on the
occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control. One or more of the events
constituting a Change of Control could also constitute a default under future indebtedness of the Issuer
and/or its Subsidiaries. Moreover, so long as there are any outstanding borrowings or drawn
commitments under the Senior Facilities, the Intercreditor Agreement prohibits payments in respect of
the Proceeds Loan or the Guarantees, including payments that might be made in respect of a Change
of Control Offer, other than in respect of scheduled interest and in certain other circumstances. See
‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ Consequently, the provision of funds
to the Issuer to fund a repurchase of Notes in a Change of Control Offer prior to the repayment in full
of all amounts due under the Senior Facilities would normally constitute a default under the Senior
Facilities, following which payments on the Proceeds Loan are generally prohibited.

164


-----

If a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are prohibited from making
funds available (directly or indirectly) to the Issuer to fund a purchase of the Notes, the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries could seek the consent of their lenders to fund the purchase of Notes or could attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such a prohibition. If they did not obtain that consent or
refinance those borrowings, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries would remain prohibited from making funds
available (directly or indirectly) to fund a repurchase of the Notes. In such case, any failure by the
Issuer to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture and the
Notes which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities. In such circumstances, the
Intercreditor Agreement would generally prohibit payments to the Issuer under the Proceeds Loan.

In any event, the ability of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to fund a repurchase of the Notes
following a Change of Control may be limited by their then existing financial resources. There can be
no assurance, therefore, that the Issuer will have sufficient funds when necessary to make any required
repurchase.

The change of control events which could give rise to the Issuer’s obligation to offer to purchase
the Notes are different from those included in the Senior Facilities. Consequently, following certain
changes of control, Subsidiaries of the Issuer could be obligated to repay Indebtedness outstanding
under the Senior Facilities, but the Issuer would not be obligated to offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture provides that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, cause, make or suffer to exist an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of
such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer)
of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received
by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance
sheet or in the notes thereto (other than Indebtedness that is Subordinated Indebtedness)) of
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, that are assumed by the transferee of
any such assets and for which the Issuer and all Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly
released by all creditors in writing;

(b) any securities received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that
are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents (to
the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received) within 180 days following the closing of
such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Noncash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer), taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to
this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, that does not exceed the greater of
A200 million and 15% of Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash
Consideration (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Noncash Consideration
being measured at the time such Designated Noncash Consideration is received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value),

shall be deemed to be ‘‘cash’’ for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose under the
Indenture or the Notes.

165


-----

Within 365 days after receipt of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply the Net
Proceeds from such Asset Sale:

(1) to permanently reduce, repay, redeem or purchase:

(a) Obligations under Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) under Credit
Facilities (and to correspondingly permanently reduce commitments thereunder), Senior Debt
of any Guarantor, or Indebtedness or Preference Shares of any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness or Preference Shares
owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), or Obligations under
Indebtedness that is guaranteed by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than on a basis
that is subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantees), or secured by a Lien or the assets of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; or

(b) unless included in (a), Obligations under Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Issuer
shall redeem or repay such Pari Passu Indebtedness only if the Issuer makes an offer to the
Holders to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Sale Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes at least equal to the proportion
that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the sum of the
total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal
amount outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness;

(2) to an investment in:

(a) one or more businesses; provided that such investment is in the form of the acquisition of
Share Capital and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, owning an amount of the Share Capital of such business such that such business
constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer immediately following such investment;

(b) capital expenditures of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(c) other assets,

in each case, engaged in, or used or useful in, a Similar Business; provided, however, that any such
investment made pursuant to a definitive agreement executed within 12 months following the date
of the Asset Sale will satisfy this requirement even if the investment occurs more than 12 months
after the Asset Sale so long as the investment is consummated within 12 months of the execution
of the definitive agreement;

(3) to an investment in:

(a) one or more businesses; provided that such investment is in the form of the acquisition of
Share Capital and results in the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, owning an amount of the Share Capital of such business such that such business
constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer immediately following such investment;

(b) properties, or

(c) other assets,

in each case, that replace the business, property and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset
Sale; provided, however, that any such investment made pursuant to a definitive agreement
executed within 12 months following the date of the Asset Sale will satisfy this requirement even if
the investment occurs more than 12 months after the Asset Sale so long as the investment is
consummated within 12 months of the execution of the definitive agreement;

166


-----

(4) to buy out or to purchase a release from lease obligations on existing retail stores; provided that
the amount so applied pursuant to this clause (4) shall not exceed A25 million in any calendar year
and shall not exceed A150 million in total from the Issue Date; and/or

(5) in the case of Net Proceeds from the sale of any of the Equity Interests in any of the Propco
Companies or from the Minor Disposal or any of their respective assets, to the making of the
Restricted Payments described in clause (16) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or to any other purpose that
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary deems appropriate, including retaining such Net Proceeds
in cash.

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale that are not applied as provided and within the time period
set forth in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds.’’ When the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds A25 million, the Issuer shall make an offer in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, pro rata to all Holders and (to the extent the Issuer
elects) all holders of Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount (on a pro
_rata basis in integral multiples of A1,000) of Notes and (to the extent the Issuer so elects) such other_
Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’). The
Asset Sale Offer will provide for an offer price in cash in respect of the Notes equal to (and, in the
case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price in cash of no more than) 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date
fixed for such purchase.

The Issuer will commence each Asset Sale Offer within ten Business Days after the date on which
the Excess Proceeds exceed A25 million by mailing the notice required pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture. To the extent the aggregate amount of Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness
tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer and/or its
Restricted Subsidiaries may use the remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject
to the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such
other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered by the Holders and the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness
exceeds the Excess Proceeds, the Notes shall be selected for purchase on a pro rata basis and, in the
case of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the Trustee or agent in relation thereto shall determine.
For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, the principal amount of such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any
such principal amounts into euro at the spot rate for the purchase of euro as published in the Financial
_Times in the ‘‘Exchange Rates’’ column (or, if the_ _Financial Times is no longer published, or if such_
information is no longer available in the Financial Times, such source as may be selected in good faith
by the Issuer and which is reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) on the day that is not earlier than five
Business Days prior to, and no later than the date of, the commencement of the Asset Sale Offer.
Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to the above provisions, the Issuer
and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness
outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not
prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuer will comply to the extent applicable with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the US
Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations, including any securities laws of the
Netherlands, to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of
the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in
the Indenture by virtue thereof. If so designated by the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any

Affiliate of the Issuer may conduct the Asset Sale Offer, including payment of the appropriate
consideration upon the tender to such Restricted Subsidiary or Affiliate of Notes.

So long as there are any outstanding borrowings or undrawn commitments under the Senior
Facilities, the Intercreditor Agreement prohibits payments in respect of the Proceeds Loan or the
Guarantees, including payments that might be made in respect of an Asset Sale Offer, other than in
respect of scheduled interest and in certain other circumstances. See ‘‘Description of Certain
Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ Consequently, the provision of funds to the Issuer to fund a
repurchase of Notes in an Asset Sale Offer prior to the repayment in full of all amounts due under the
Senior Facilities would normally constitute a default under the Senior Facilities.

**_Selection and Notice_**

Save to the extent provided in connection with Asset Sale Offers, if less than all of the Notes are
to be purchased or redeemed at any time, the Notes will be selected for purchase or redemption as
follows:

(1) if the Notes to be purchased or redeemed are listed on any securities exchange, in compliance with
the requirements of the principal securities exchange on which the Notes are listed; or

(2) if the rules of any such exchange do not provide any such requirements or if the Notes to be
redeemed or purchased are not listed on any securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by
such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems fair and appropriate.

No Note shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Note would have a denomination that is less
than A50,000 or other than an integral multiple of A1,000.

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be given to each Holder pursuant to the procedures
described below under ‘‘—Notices.’’

If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption
that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to
be purchased or redeemed. In relation to Definitive Registered Notes, a new Note in principal amount
equal to the unpurchased or unredeemed portion of any Note purchased or redeemed in part will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. On and after any
purchase or redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the purchase or redemption
price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof tendered for purchase or called for
redemption. The Trustee assumes no liability in relation to selections made by it as contemplated
above.

_provided further that sub-clause (a) and (b) of this clause (13) will not apply to any Refinancing_
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Guarantor, or apply to any
refunding or refinancing of any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien;

(14) Indebtedness, Disqualified Share Capital or Preference Shares of Persons that are acquired by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or merged, consolidated, amalgamated or
otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related
liabilities) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture; provided that such Indebtedness, Disqualified Share Capital or Preference Shares are
not incurred or issued in connection with such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
other combination, and, after giving effect to such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation
or other combination, either:

(a) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary would be permitted to incur at least A1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first

received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its
Shareholder Debt or Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Share Capital, Designated
Preference Shares or Excluded Contributions) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than

179


-----

through the issuance of Disqualified Share Capital, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded
Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that
any such net cash proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of
making Restricted Payments under clause (c) of the first paragraph and clause (2), (4) and (8) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described above under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted
Payments’’ to the extent the Issuer and its or any Restricted Subsidiaries incurs Indebtedness or
issues Disqualified Share Capital or Preference Shares in reliance thereon; and

(17) Indebtedness incurred by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables Financing that is not
recourse to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries other than a Receivables Subsidiary
(except for Standard Securitization Undertakings).

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Share Capital or Preference Shares meets the criteria of more than one of
the categories described in clauses (1) through (17) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify and, from time to time,
may reclassify such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Share Capital or Preference Shares in any
manner that complies with this covenant and such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Share Capital or
Preference Shares will be treated as having been incurred pursuant to only one of such clauses or
pursuant to the first paragraph hereof (except as otherwise set forth in clause (11)).

The accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value or original issue discount, the
payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness (including Shareholder Debt),
Disqualified Share Capital or Preference Shares with substantially equivalent terms and the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness on the Issue Date as
Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP to IFRS or US GAAP, will not be deemed to be an incurrence
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Share Capital or Preference Shares for purposes of this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, the euro-equivalent principal amount
of Indebtedness denominated in any currency other than euro shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-euro denominated Indebtedness was incurred, in
the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving debt; provided that, if Indebtedness is
incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a different currency, and such refinancing
would cause a euro-denominated restriction specified in this covenant to be exceeded if calculated at
the otherwise applicable currency exchange rate, such restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; and provided further that if any amount under
a revolving credit facility may be reallocated into a different currency, and Indebtedness is incurred
pursuant to such a revolving credit facility, a euro-denominated restriction specified in this covenant
that would have been exceeded if the amount of such Indebtedness were calculated at the otherwise
applicable currency exchange rate shall be deemed not to have been exceeded if such restriction would
not have been exceeded were the principal amount of such Indebtedness to have been calculated at the
currency exchange rate applicable on the date of such reallocation.

Subject to the preceding proviso, the principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens), in each case, to secure
any Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, or any income or

180


-----

profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom (the ‘‘Initial Lien’’), in
each case, unless, at or prior thereto, the Notes are equally and ratably secured with (or senior to, in
the event the Lien relates to Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations so secured.

Any such Lien will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with
(i) the unconditional release of the Initial Lien (provided that if the release is in connection with the
sale of the pledged assets the proceeds are applied to the secured parties to the extent required by the
relevant security documents), (ii) if the assets subject to such Lien, or all of the Share Capital of the
owner of such assets or any Holding Company of such owner owned by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
or any Holding Company of such owner, are sold or otherwise disposed of in each case, to any Person
other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and the proceeds therefrom are applied in accordance
with the provisions of the covenant described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales’’, (iii) upon the full and final payment of all amounts payable by the Issuer under the Notes and
the Indenture or (iv) upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes in accordance with ‘‘—Legal
Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance’’ or ‘‘—Satisfaction and Discharge.’’

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

The Issuer shall not merge, consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise combine with or into or wind up
into any Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets directly or indirectly
(through a sale of its shares or assets or otherwise) in one or more related transactions, to any Person,
unless:

(1) the Issuer is the surviving or resulting corporation, or the Person formed by or surviving any such
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination (if other than the Issuer) or to which
such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made, is
organized or existing under the laws of any state which is a member of the European Union,
Canada, the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia or any
territory thereof (such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the ‘‘Successor Issuer’’);

(2) the Successor Issuer, if other than the Issuer, expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer
under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security and the Notes (except with respect
to any transaction of a kind set forth below in clause (a) of the last paragraph of this covenant)
pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other documents or instruments in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or related transactions on a pro forma basis, no
Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at
the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period:

(a) the Issuer or any Successor Issuer, as applicable, would be permitted to incur at least A1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first
sentence of the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and Preference Shares;’’ or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer or any Successor Issuer, as applicable, would
be greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer on an historical basis for such
four-quarter period;

(5) each Guarantor (if not a party to the transaction) of the Notes (if any) shall have by supplemental
indenture confirmed its Guarantee of the Notes (unless such Guarantee shall be released in
connection with the transaction and otherwise in compliance with the Indenture); and

181


-----

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, to
the effect that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, other combination or transfer and such
supplemental indenture comply with the Indenture.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for the Issuer under the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security (as applicable) and the Notes; provided that following any lease
or similar conveyance of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in one or more related transactions, each of the lessor and the lessee (or
equivalent) shall remain liable for the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security (as applicable) and the Notes.

Notwithstanding the requirements of clause (4) of the first paragraph of this ‘‘—Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets’’ covenant:

(a) the Issuer and Target may merge, amalgamate or otherwise combine into Target or the Issuer,
as the case may be;

(b) a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may merge, consolidate, amalgamate or otherwise
combine into the Issuer or any Guarantor or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

(c) the Issuer may merge with an Affiliate organized solely for the purpose of incorporating the
Issuer in any state which is a member state of the European Union, Canada or the United
States of America, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia or any territory thereof to
realize tax or other benefits (including in connection with the conversion of the Issuer from a
Dutch N.V. to a Dutch B.V.) so long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (3) of the first paragraph of this
‘‘Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets’’ covenant) shall not apply to (A) a
Permitted Reorganization conducted in compliance with the definition thereof or (B) any transactions
which constitute an Asset Sale if the Issuer has complied with the covenant described under
‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,’’ to the extent (i) the sale is not made to an
Affiliate of the Issuer, (ii) the Net Proceeds received by the Issuer in connection with such sale are in
an amount no less than the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid
interest and (iii) the Issuer makes an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders with the proceeds of such Asset
Sale and accepts for payment all Notes tendered in such offer. For the purposes of this covenant, the
sale, lease or transfer of a single Business Unit of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be
deemed to be a sale, lease or transfer of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries unless four or fewer Business Units are owned by the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries prior to any such sale, lease or transfer.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer
or Preference Shares that become an obligation of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a
Guarantor (or are deemed to be incurred by or become the obligations of any entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any transaction taking place in compliance with clause 4(b) above
shall be deemed to have been incurred in compliance with the covenant entitled ‘‘—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and Preference Shares’’
(including for the purposes of refinancing such Indebtedness in accordance with clause (13) of such
covenant).

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to,
or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any

182


-----

property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement,
understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer (each
of the foregoing, an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of
A10 million, unless:

(1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable
transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(2) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related
Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration in excess of A15 million, a resolution
adopted by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer approving such
Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee certifying that
such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) transactions between or among the Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and/or, to the

an Affiliate only by virtue of the Issuer’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ ownership in such
Joint Venture);

or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or
divestitures, which payments are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors
of the Issuer in good faith;

(5) transactions as to which the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, delivers to

the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary as the case may be, from a financial point of view or
meets the requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(6) payments or loans (or cancellation of loans) to or for the benefit of any Management Equity

the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(7) any agreement of the Issuer and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect as of the Issue Date,

performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer of obligations under, any

after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (8) to the extent that the terms of any
such amendment or new agreement are not disadvantageous to the Holders in any material
respect;

disclosed in this offering memorandum, and any Permitted Reorganization;

Indenture which are fair to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the good faith
determination of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or of the
senior management thereof, or are on terms at least as favorable to the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance
or consensual restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer:

(b) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of

The preceding paragraph will not prohibit any such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or
by reason of:

(1) any agreement or instrument in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date (including the Senior
Facilities, the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Proceeds Loan);

184


-----

(2) pursuant to any agreement or instrument of a Person, or related to Indebtedness or Share Capital
of a Person, which Person is acquired by or merged, amalgamated, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or which agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with an
acquisition of assets from such person, as in effect at the time of such acquisition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or combination (except to the extent that such Indebtedness was
incurred to finance, or otherwise incurred in connection with such acquisition, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or combination); provided that for purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Issuer, any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such
Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed, as the case may be, by the
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, when such Person becomes the
Successor Issuer;

supplement or other modifications to an Initial Agreement (an ‘‘Amendment’’); provided, however,
that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such Refinancing Agreement or

encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(4) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose
restrictions of the nature discussed in clause (3) of the preceding paragraph on the property so

of such Subsidiary;

(7) secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenants described
under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and
Preference Shares’’ and ‘‘—Liens’’ that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets
securing such Indebtedness;

(8) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered
into in the ordinary course of business;

(9) any agreement or instrument (A) relating to any Indebtedness or Preference Shares of a Restricted

Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and Preference Shares’’ (i) if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities
(as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or (ii) if the encumbrances and restrictions are not
materially more disadvantageous to the Holders than is customary incomparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer) and either (x) the Issuer determines that such
encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal and
interest payments on the Notes as and when they come due or (y) such encumbrances and

185

restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in respect of a payment or financial
maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness, (B) constituting an intercreditor agreement
on terms substantially equivalent to the Intercreditor Agreement or (C) relating to any loan or
advance by the Issuer to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer subsequent to the Issue Date;
_provided that with respect to clause (C) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such_
agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities, the Share Pledges, the Proceeds
Loan, the Proceeds Loan Pledges and the Intercreditor Agreement (as in effect on the Issue
Date);

(10) customary provisions in joint venture agreements and other similar agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business;

ordinary course of business or any Permitted Lien; and

(13) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such
Qualified Receivables Financing.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary that, after the Issue
Date,

(a) guarantees Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities; or

(b) guarantees Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness under the
Senior Facilities or pursuant to GAAP Operating Leases);

to simultaneously or prior thereto execute and deliver a supplemental indenture or other appropriate
agreement providing for such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of the Notes on the same terms and
conditions as those set forth in the Indenture (each such Guarantee of the Notes, an ‘‘Additional
_Guarantee’’)._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted
Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Guarantee would reasonably be expected to
give rise to or result in:

(1) any violation of applicable law that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures
reasonably available to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Tax) other than reasonable
out of pocket expenses and other than reasonable governmental expenses incurred in connection
with any governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to
clause (1) undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee,

which in any such case cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the
Restricted Subsidiary.

Each Additional Guarantee shall rank (x) subordinate in right of payment to any guarantee of
Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities or any other Senior Debt and shall constitute Senior
Subordinated Debt of such Guarantor and (y) prior in right of payment to any Subordinated
Indebtedness of such Guarantor.

186


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the other provisions of the Indenture, any Additional
Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer of the Notes shall provide by its terms that it shall
be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in the circumstances described below.
Any Additional Guarantee shall be considered a ‘‘—Guarantee’’ as described in ‘‘Guarantees’’, and, in
particular, shall be subject to the subordination provisions described therein and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

A Guarantee as to any Guarantor shall terminate and be of no further force or effect and such
Guarantor shall be deemed to be released from all obligations in respect of the Notes upon the events
described under ‘‘—Guarantees.’’

**_Limitation on Layering_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any
Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clause (14) of the second paragraph of the
covenant under ‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Share
Capital and Preference Shares’’) that is subordinate in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is either (a) equal in right of
payment with the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, as the case may be, or (b) subordinate in right
of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, as the case may be.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Issuer will (x) make available to the investor website service maintained by Bloomberg L.P. (or
if such service website is no longer maintained or accessible for these purposes, a similar service) or
(y) post on its website, and in either case provide the Trustee and Holders the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year (or 150 days in the case of the first fiscal
year of the Issuer ending after the Issue Date), annual reports containing a level of detail that is
comparable in all material respects to this offering memorandum and the following information:
(a) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer (including the Propco Companies) as of the
end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and statements
of cash flow of the Issuer (including the Propco Companies) for the three most recent fiscal years,
including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as of the end of each such
financial year, and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;
(b) unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer (excluding the Propco Companies) as of
the end of the two (or, if less, as many fiscal years have elapsed since the Issue Date) most recent
fiscal years and unaudited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the
Issuer (excluding the Propco Companies) for the three (or, if less, as many fiscal years have
elapsed since the Issue Date) most recent fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such
financial statements, for and as of the end of each such financial year, in each case, reconciled to
the audited financial statements referred to in clause (a) above; (c) pro forma income statement
and balance sheet information, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year; (d) to the extent relating to annual periods, an operating and financial
review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations,
financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments
and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (e) a description of the business, management
and shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material
contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (f) material risk factors and
material recent developments; provided that such annual reports need not contain figures or
discussion relating to the corresponding prior year periods for the fiscal years ended February 1,
2004 and February 2, 2003 relating to the Issuer excluding the Propco Companies except for a

187


-----

statement of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA, capital expenditures, net debt, interest expense
and net rental expense of the Issuer excluding the Propco Companies;

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the first such fiscal quarter, 90 days) following the end of the
first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer beginning with the quarter ending
November 1, 2004 all quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (a) an
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet (including the Propco Companies) as of the end
of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow (including Propco
Companies) for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed
balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote
disclosure; (b) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer (excluding the Propco
Companies) as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and
cash flow (including Propco Companies) for the most recent quarter year-to-date period ending on
the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year periods, together with
condensed footnote disclosure, in each case, reconciled to the unaudited financial statements
referred to in clause (a) above; (c) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information,
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations
that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter; (d) an
operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of
material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; and (e) material recent
developments and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual
report; provided that in the case of the first three such quarterly reports, such reports need not
contain figures or discussion relating to the corresponding prior year periods relating to the Issuer
excluding the Propco Companies except for a statement of the consolidated revenues, EBITDA,
capital expenditures, net debt, interest expense and net rental expense of the Issuer excluding the
Propco Companies; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition, restructuring, senior
management changes at the Issuer or change in auditors, a report containing a description of such
event.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared on a consistent basis
for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above
may, in the event of a change in applicable GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to
such periods, subject to the provisions of the Indenture. No report need include separate financial
statements for any Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer. At any time that any of the
Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries (other than the Propco Companies), then the
quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a
reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes
thereto, and in the operating and financial review of the financial condition and results of operations,
of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the
Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the US Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer will furnish to the Holders, upon their request, the information required to
be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the US Securities Act.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the rules of that Stock
Exchange will so require, the above information will also be made available in Dublin through the
offices of the Paying Agent in Dublin.

188


-----

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer to,
take or omit to take any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing
the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with
respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and
the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security
Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes (other than any Additional Notes)
and the other beneficiaries described in the Security, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral,
except that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; provided,
however, that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the release or replacement of any Security in
compliance with the terms of the Indenture as described under ‘‘—Security—Releases’’ and (b) any
Security may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or
replaced, if contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent
Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement, or (2) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien
or Liens created under the Security so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified
or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the
event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and/or the Security
Trustee, as the case may be, shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to
any such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement
without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, any series of the Notes has achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (‘‘a Suspension Event’’), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which such series of the Notes ceases to
have Investment Grade Status, the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following
captions will not apply to such series of the Notes: ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’
‘‘—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and
Preference Shares,’’ ‘‘—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries,’’
‘‘—Transactions with Affiliates,’’ and under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders,’’ the provisions of
clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
All or Substantially All Assets,’’ and any related default provisions of the Indenture will cease to be
effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of such series
of the Notes. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their
terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not,
however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of
the Suspension Event, and the ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant will be interpreted as if
it had been in effect since the date of the Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have
occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended.

189


-----

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture will provide that at the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the
Incurrence by the Issuer or any Guarantor of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation or Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and Preference Shares’’ (including by way of a
guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) or clauses (1), (11) or (13) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation or Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Share Capital and Preference Shares,’’ (in each case, to the
extent such Indebtedness is Incurred under Credit Facilities with Persons other than Affiliates of the
Issuer or is Public Indebtedness) the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors and the Trustee shall enter into
with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement, including containing substantially the same terms with respect to the subordination,
payment blockage, limitation on enforcement and release of guarantees and, subordination, payment
blockage, release, limitations on enforcement, priority and release of security interests (or terms more
favorable to the Holders); provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Trustee under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to any such Intercreditor
Agreement, such other Indebtedness may constitute Senior Debt, Senior Subordinated Debt that is pari
_passu with the Guarantees or Subordinated Indebtedness. Any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement_
shall provide for the release for any subordinated guaranteed security on the same terms as the
Guarantees.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement (the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreements’’) to: (i) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency in any of the Intercreditor Agreements, (ii) increase the
amount of Indebtedness of the types covered by any of the Intercreditor Agreements that may be
incurred by the Issuer or a Guarantor that is subject to any of the Intercreditor Agreements (including
the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the
Notes), (iii) add Guarantors to any of the Intercreditor Agreements, (iv) further secure the Notes
(including Additional Notes), (v) make provision for the security securing the Additional Notes to rank
_pari passu with the Security, (vi) to provide for the discharge of any of the Intercreditor Agreements to_
the extent that Indebtedness that is Senior Debt thereunder has been discharged or is to be refinanced,
or (vii) make any other such change to any of the Intercreditor Agreements that does not adversely
affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter
into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority
in aggregate or principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted by
‘‘Amendment, Supplement and Waiver’’ and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or
adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or such
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any of the Intercreditor Agreements, the
Trustee shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase,
defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby
provided that such transaction would comply with the provisions of the Indenture described under the
covenant ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture also will provide that each holder of a Note, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed
to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of each of the Intercreditor Agreements
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

190


-----

A copy of any of the Intercreditor Agreements shall be available for inspection during normal business
hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the office of the Trustee and, for so long as
any Notes are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, at the offices of the paying agent in Dublin.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The following events constitute Events of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due and payable of interest or any Additional
Amounts on or with respect to the Notes;

(2) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, optional redemption (after such
redemption becomes unconditional), repurchase, acceleration or otherwise, of principal or
premium on the Notes;

(3) (x) failure by the Issuer for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to comply with its
obligations described under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control’’ or
‘‘—Certain Covenants’’ (in each case, other than a failure to comply with Clause (1) or (2)), or
(y) failure by the Issuer for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to comply with its
obligations under any of its other agreements in the Indenture or the Notes;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there
is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness
or guarantee now exists or is created after the Issue Date, if both:

(a) such default either:

(I) results from the failure to pay any such Indebtedness at its final stated maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods); or

(II) relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such
Indebtedness at its final stated maturity and results in the holder or holders of such
Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness or to be placed on demand to become due prior
to its final stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at final stated maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods), or which has been placed on demand or the maturity
of which has been so accelerated, aggregate A25 million or more at anyone time outstanding;

(5) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer to pay final judgments aggregating
in excess of A35 million, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) any Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer ceases to be in full force and effect, or
the relevant Guarantor asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that such
Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, other than, in each case, pursuant to limitations on
enforceability, validity or effectiveness imposed by applicable law (other than limitations which are
the result solely of actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries) or the terms of such

191


-----

Guarantee or except in accordance with the terms of such Guarantee, the Intercreditor
Agreements or the Indenture, including the release provisions thereof;

(7) the Security shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect, or the Security shall be declared
invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or the relevant grantor of such
Security asserts, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that such Security is invalid
or unenforceable for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the
Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, other than, in each case, pursuant to limitations on
enforceability, validity or effectiveness imposed by applicable law (other than limitations which are
the result solely of actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries) or the terms of such
Security or except in accordance with the terms of such Security, the Intercreditor Agreements or
the Indenture, including the release provisions thereof;

(8) the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer pursuant to or within the meaning of any
Bankruptcy Law:

(i) commences a voluntary case;

(ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case;

(iii) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property; or

(iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or

(v) or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; or

(9) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

(i) is for relief against the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer in an involuntary
case;

(ii) appoints a Custodian of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer or for any
substantial part of its property; or

(iii) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer;

or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws, and any such order or decree remains
unstayed and in effect for 60 days.

The foregoing shall constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of
Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any
judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body.

The term ‘‘Bankruptcy Law’’ means the Dutch Bankruptcy Code (Fallissementswet) or any other
Dutch law dealing with the incapability of a debtor to pay its debt, the debtor’s over-indebtedness or a
lack of assets to cover a debtor’s outstanding debt or the laws of any other jurisdiction relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up, liquidation, reorganization or the relief of debtors. The term
‘‘Custodian’’ means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any
Bankruptcy Law.

In the case of an Event of Default arising under clauses (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this
section, all outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without further action or
notice. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clauses (8) or (9) above) occurs and is
continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, interest, and Additional Amounts, if any,
and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable
immediately.

192


-----

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject
to certain limitations, including the limitations on enforcement described under ‘‘—Guarantees’’ and
‘‘—Security,’’ Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the
Indenture may, subject to the Trustee being indemnified to its satisfaction, direct the Trustee in its
exercise of any trust or power. The Indenture provides that the Trustee may withhold from Holders
notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default, except a Default or Event of Default relating to
the payment of principal, premium, interest, or Additional Amounts, if it determines that withholding
notice is in their interest.

The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes issued thereunder by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of
such Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture,
except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal, premium, interest, and
Additional Amounts, if any, of any such Note held by a non-consenting Holder.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such
Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default in relation to
the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded automatically and without any action of the Trustee
or the Holders if, within 20 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness that gave rise to the Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may
be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that gave rise to the Event of Default has been cured.

The Indenture provides that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
regarding compliance with the Indenture and the Issuer is required within five Business Days upon
becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying
such Default or Event of Default.

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and shareholders**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Parent Company of the Issuer shall have any liability for any obligations of the
Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer with respect to the Notes, the Guarantees, the Security, the
Proceeds Loan or the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the US federal securities laws, and it is the view of the Commission
that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of the obligations discharged with
respect to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security issued and incurred under the Indenture (‘‘Legal
_Defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Events of Default except for:_

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal, premium, if any, interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust
created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of a Paying Agent, Registrar and transfer
agent, and holding money in trust for payments on the Notes;

193


-----

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee, and the obligations of
the Issuer and the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the
Indenture (‘‘Covenant Defeasance’’) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall
not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant
Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment on other indebtedness, bankruptcy,
liquidation, reorganization, administration, moratorium and receivership events) described under the
caption ‘‘—Events of Default and Remedies’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect
to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes
issued under the Indenture:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders, cash
in euro or euro-denominated non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in
such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants, for the payment of the aggregate principal, premium, if any,
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(A) an opinion of counsel (reasonably acceptable to the Trustee) in the United States to the effect
that Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to US federal income tax on the
same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of Legal Defeasance only,
such opinion of counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within
90 days or resign.

The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture provides
that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in
the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own
affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights
or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of such Notes, unless such Holder shall
have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or
expense.

**Governing law**

at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the

GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness
outstanding during the relevant period under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma basis

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

Each series of notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘144A Global Note’’). Each series of notes sold outside the
United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a global
note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Reg S Global Note,’’ and together with
the 144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). On the closing date, the Global Notes will be deposited
with, and registered in the name of, a common depository for Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, or
its nominee.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Note (‘‘Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests’’) and
ownership of interests in the Reg S Global Note (the ‘‘Reg S Book-Entry Interests,’’ and together with
the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-Entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and their participants.
The notes will not be eligible for clearance with The Depository Trust Company.

Except as set forth below under ‘‘—Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes,’’ the Book-Entry
Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking will credit
on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest
beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities
in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge
Book-Entry Interests.

So long as the notes are held in global form, the common depository for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream Banking (or its nominee) will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all
purposes under the Indenture and ‘‘holders’’ of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners
or ‘‘holders’’ of notes for any purpose. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream Banking and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the
Indenture.

None of the issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be
liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream
Banking, as applicable, will distribute the amount received by them in respect of the Global Note so
redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of
such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The issuer understands that under existing practices of
Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, if fewer than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time,
Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they
deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than A50,000
principal amount may be redeemed in part.

229


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream
Banking, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary
procedures. We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever
nature, except as may be required by law and as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—
Withholding Taxes.’’ If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent
described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes’’ above, we will pay additional amounts
as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or
owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such
holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest,
as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the issuer, the guarantors and the Trustee will treat the
registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g., the common depository or its nominee) as the owner
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the
issuer or the Trustee or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream Banking or any participant or indirect
participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such
payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream Banking or any participant or indirect participants, or
for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream Banking
or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a
Book-Entry Interest;

   - Euroclear, Clearstream Banking or any participant or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers
registered in ‘‘street name.’’

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream Banking have advised the issuer that they will take any action
permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion
to the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will not exercise any discretion in the granting
of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there
is an event of default under the notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

230


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will be effected in
accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream Banking’s rules and will be settled in immediately available
funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to
sell the notes to persons in jurisdictions which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge
such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under the caption ‘‘Notice to
Investors.’’ Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer
discussed under the caption ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in
the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the
Securities Act).

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be
a Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such
other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and
other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains
such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, to the extent permitted by Euroclear and/or Clearstream
Banking, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive notes in registered form without
coupons (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’):

   - if either Euroclear or Clearstream Banking notifies the issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depository and a successor depository is not appointed by the issuer within
120 days;

  - if Euroclear or Clearstream Banking so request following an event of default under the
Indenture; or

   - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
Euroclear or Clearstream Banking following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described
in the immediately preceding third bullet, its customary procedure is to request that the issuer issue or
cause to be issued notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream Banking, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and
based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry

231


-----

Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in ‘‘Notice
to Investors,’’ unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the event that individual Definitive Registered Notes are issued (in the circumstances described
above), payments and transfers with respect thereto may be executed at the office of AIB/BNY Fund
Management (Ireland) Limited. as paying agent in Ireland. If issued, individual Definitive Registered
Notes may be presented for registration of transfer at the office of AIB/BNY Fund Management
(Ireland) Limited as transfer agent in Ireland, upon delivery of a written instrument of transfer, a form
of which will be available at the office of such agent. No service charge will be made for any
registration of transfer of notes, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
governmental charge payable in connection with that registration.

To the extent permitted by law, the issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents and the Registrars shall
be entitled to treat the registered holder as the absolute owner thereof.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

**_Initial Settlement_**

Initial settlement for the notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream Banking accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities
custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, and
will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and seller’s
accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream Banking**

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, Euroclear and
Clearstream Banking hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking provide to their
participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of
internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream
Banking interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking participants are

and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian
relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream Banking participant, either directly or indirectly.

**TAXATION**

**Certain Dutch tax considerations**

The following summary of certain Dutch taxation matters is based on the laws and practice in
force as of the date of this offering memorandum and is subject to any changes in law and the
interpretation and application thereof, which changes could be made with retroactive effect. The
following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations
that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, hold or dispose of the notes, and does not purport to
deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers
in securities) may be subject to special rules. Except as otherwise indicated, this summary only
addresses the consequences to investors who do not have any connection with the Netherlands other

consequences of their acquiring, holding and disposing of the notes under the laws of their country of
citizenship, residence, domicile or incorporation.

**_Withholding Tax_**

All payments by the issuer of interest and principal under the notes can be made free of
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied,

therein.

A holder of a note who derives income from a note or who realises a gain on the disposal or
redemption of a note will not be subject to Dutch taxation on such income or capital gains unless:

(i) the holder is, or is deemed to be, resident in the Netherlands, or, where the holder is an
individual, such holder has elected to be treated as a resident of the Netherlands; or

(ii) such income or gain is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is either effectively
managed in the Netherlands or carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste
_inrichting) or permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in the Netherlands; or_

(iii) the holder is not an individual and the holder has, directly or indirectly, a substantial interest
(aanmerkelijk belang) or a deemed substantial interest in the issuer and such interest does not
form part of the assets of an enterprise; or

(iii) the holder is an individual and the holder has, directly or indirectly, a substantial interest
(aanmerkelijk belang) in the issuer or such income or gain otherwise qualifies as income from
miscellaneous activities (belastbaar resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden) in the Netherlands as
defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001).

**_Gift, Estate or Inheritance Taxes_**

Dutch gift, estate or inheritance taxes will not be levied on the transfer of a note by way of gift by,
or on the death of, a holder, unless:

(i) the holder is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant
provisions; or

(ii) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or as a gift made by, or on behalf of, a person who,
at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for the
purpose of the relevant provisions; or

233


-----

(iii) such note is attributable to an enterprise or part thereof which is either effectively managed in
the Netherlands or carried on through a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in the Netherlands.

**_Value Added Tax_**

There is no Dutch value added tax payable by a holder of a note in respect of payments in
consideration for the issue of the notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the
notes, or the transfer of the notes.

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

There is no Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in the
Netherlands by a holder of a note in respect of or in connection with the execution, delivery and/or
enforcement by legal proceedings (including any foreign judgment in the courts of the Netherlands) of
the notes or the performance of the issuer’s obligations under the notes.

**_Residence_**

A holder of a note will not be treated as resident of the Netherlands by reason only of the holding
of a note or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of the notes.

**European Union Directive on the Taxation of Savings**

The European Union has adopted a directive regarding the taxation of savings income. Subject to
a number of important conditions being met, it is proposed that Member States will be required from
July 1, 2005 to provide to the tax authorities of other Member States details of payments of interest
and other similar income paid by a person to an individual in another Member State, except that
Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will instead impose a withholding system for a transitional period
unless during such period they elect otherwise.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with notes
that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquired our notes upon
original issuance at their initial offering price.

A ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner that is for United States federal income tax purposes
any of the following:

   - an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or

   - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one
or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust
or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations to be
treated as a United States person.

234


-----

This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
‘‘Code’’), and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those
authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax
consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of
United States federal income taxes or all tax considerations that may be relevant to U.S. holders in
light of their personal circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the
United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment
under the United States federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:

   - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in
securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark to market method of
accounting for their securities, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, investors in pass-through entities, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

   - tax consequences to persons holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale
or conversion transaction or a straddle;

   - tax consequences to holders of the notes whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the United States
dollar;

  - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any; or

   - any state, local or foreign tax consequences.

If a partnership holds our notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the
status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding
our notes, you should consult your tax advisors.

**If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning**
**the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the ownership of the notes, as**
**well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Payments of Interest**

Except as set forth below, interest on a note (including any payment of additional amounts) will
generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your
method of accounting for tax purposes. Subject to the discussion of exchange gain and loss below,
interest income on a note generally will constitute foreign source income and for purposes of the
United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered ‘‘passive income’’ or, for certain types of
U.S. holders, ‘‘financial services income.’’

If you receive interest payments made in euro and you use the cash basis method of accounting,
you will be required to include in income the dollar value of the amount received, determined by
translating the euro received at the ‘‘spot rate’’ for euro on the date such payment is received
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into dollars. You will not recognize exchange
gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment.

If you use the accrual method of accounting, you may determine the amount of income recognized
with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will
be required to include in income for each taxable year the dollar value of the interest that has accrued
during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period
or periods during which such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate
interest income at the spot rate on:

   - the last day of the accrual period,

   - the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year, or

235


-----

   - the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of
the accrual period.

This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed
without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’). You should consult your own tax
advisor as to the availability of making the above election.

Upon receipt of an interest payment on such note (including, upon the sale of a note, the receipt
of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you
will recognize United States source ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between
the dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the ‘‘spot rate’’ for
euro on the date such payment is received) and the dollar value of the interest income you previously
included in income with respect to such payment.

**Sale, Exchange and Retirement of Notes**

Your tax basis in a note will, in general, be your dollar cost for that note. You will recognize gain
or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement or
other disposition of a note (less an amount equal to any accrued interest that you did not previously
include in income, which will be taxable as interest income) and your tax basis in the note. If you
purchased a note with foreign currency, your cost will be the dollar value of the foreign currency
amount paid for such note determined at the time of such purchase. If your note is sold, exchanged or
retired for an amount denominated in foreign currency, then your amount realized generally will be
based on the spot rate of the foreign currency on the date of sale, exchange or retirement. If you are a
cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an established securities market, foreign currency
paid or received is translated into dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or
sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale
of notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will be capital gain or loss
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, retirement or other
disposition, you have held the note for more than one year. Capital gains of individuals derived in
respect of capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale,
exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note would generally be treated as United States source
gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a note may be treated as
exchange gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally
will be United States source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the note is your
purchase price for the note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange
gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the dollar value of the principal amount
determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of the note and (ii) the
dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the note. The amount of
exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of
the note.

**Reportable Transactions**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including
certain foreign currency transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required
to be reported to the IRS including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a euro note or foreign currency received in respect of a euro note to the extent

236


-----

that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a
threshold amount. Holders considering the purchase of the notes should consult with their own tax
advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the notes,
including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**Backup Withholding and Information Reporting**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments we make to you and the
proceeds from a sale of a note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient such as a corporation.
Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest
payments, fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications,
you may be subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability
provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.

de valores), as amended, and Royal Decree 291/1992, on Issues and Public Offerings of
Securities (Real Decreto 291/92, de 27 de marzo, sobre emisiones y ofertas p´ublicas de
valores), as amended; and

(x) the offering of the notes has not been cleared by CONSOB (the Italian Securities Exchange
Commission) pursuant to Italian securities legislation and, accordingly, no notes may be
offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, nor may copies of this offering memorandum
or of any other document relating to the notes be distributed in the Republic of Italy, except
(i) to qualified investors (operatori qualificati), as defined in Article 31, second paragraph, of
CONSOB Regulation No. 11522 of July 1, 1998, as amended; or (ii) in circumstances which
are exempted from the rules on solicitation of investments pursuant to Article 100 of
Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998, as amended (the ‘‘Italian Financial Services
Act’’), its implementing CONSOB regulations including Article 33, first paragraph, of
CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended. Any offer, sale or delivery of
the notes or distribution of copies of this offering memorandum or any other document
relating to the notes in the Republic of Italy under (i) or (ii) above must be (a) made by an
investment firm, bank or financial intermediary permitted to conduct such activities in the
Republic of Italy in accordance with the Italian Financial Services Act and Legislative Decree

240


-----

guidelines of the Bank of Italy; and (b) in compliance with Article 129 of the Banking Act and
the implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy pursuant to which the issue or the offer of
securities in the Republic of Italy may need to be preceded and followed by an appropriate
notice to be filed with the Bank of Italy depending, inter alia, on the aggregate value of the
securities issued or offered in the Republic of Italy and their characteristics; and in accordance
with any other applicable laws and regulations including any relevant limitations which may be
imposed by CONSOB or the Bank of Italy. In any case, the notes cannot be offered or sold to
any individuals in Italy, neither in the primary or secondary market.

The notes of each series will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading
market. Application has been made to list the notes on the Irish Stock Exchange. However, we cannot
assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower
than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue
after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market
in the notes of each series. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any
market-making activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. In addition, marketmaking activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and may be limited. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of or the trading
market for the notes of either series.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open
market. These transactions may include over-allotment, syndicate covering transactions and stabilizing
transactions. Over-allotment involves sales of notes in excess of the principal amount of notes to be
purchased by the initial purchasers in this offering, which creates a short position for the initial
purchasers. Covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions consist of
certain bids or purchases of notes made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. Any of these activities may have the effect
of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of
the notes to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of
these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market
or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them
at any time.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to
make because of any of those liabilities.

In connection with the offering, Citigroup or any person acting for Citigroup may, for a limited
period after the issue date, over-allot or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price
of the notes and any associated securities at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail.
However, neither Citigroup, nor any person acting for it, has any obligation to do this. Such stabilizing,
if commenced, may be discontinued at any time, and must be brought to an end after a limited period.

**Other Relationships**

Affiliates of the initial purchasers are lenders under our syndicated credit facilities. See
‘‘Description of Certain Indebtedness.’’ The initial purchasers and their affiliates have performed
commercial and investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have
received customary fees and expenses. The initial purchasers may, from time to time, engage in
transactions with, and perform services for, us in the ordinary course of their business.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and,
unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a

securities laws. Accordingly, the notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified
institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under
the Securities Act and in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with us and the initial purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the notes have not been registered under the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities law, are being offered for resale in transactions not
requiring registration under the Securities Act or any other securities law, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and may not be offered, sold or otherwise
transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction
not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in
paragraph (4) below.

(2) It is not an ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of ours or acting on
our behalf and it is either:

(i) a Qualified Institutional Buyer, or QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and is aware that any sale of notes to it will be made in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, of which the acquisition will be for its own account
or for the account of another QIB; or

(ii) an institution that, at the time the offer to purchase the notes was made and at the time
the buy order for the notes was originated, was outside the United States within the
meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act.

(3) It acknowledges that neither we, nor the initial purchasers, nor any person representing us or
the initial purchasers, has made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of
any notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum, which offering
memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment
decision with respect to the notes. It has had access to such financial and other information
concerning us and the notes it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to
purchase any of the notes.

(4) It is purchasing the notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for
offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or
any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control
and subject to its or their ability to resell such notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or
any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act.

Each holder of notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (‘‘Rule 144A Notes’’) agrees on its own
behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the notes, and each
subsequent holder of the notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell
or otherwise transfer such notes prior to the date that is two years after the later of the date
(the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) of the original issue and the last date on which
the issuer or any of our affiliates was the owner of such notes (or any predecessor thereto)

only (i) to us, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective under
the Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the notes are eligible pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act, to a person it reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own account
or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur
outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or
(v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the
disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times
within its or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any
applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the issuer’s and the Trustee’s
rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) to require the delivery
of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information satisfactory to each of them
and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form
appearing on the other side of the security is completed and delivered by the transferor to the
Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale
Restriction Termination Date. Each purchaser acknowledges that each Rule 144A note will
contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

**ANNEX A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DUTCH GAAP AND IFRS**

**Introduction**

On 7 June 2002, the European Council approved a Regulation on the introduction of International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) into the EU for financial years beginning on or after 1
January 2005 for the consolidated financial statements of all listed groups. Because this is a Regulation
rather than a Directive it passed immediately and directly into national law and does not have to be
approved by Member States of the EU. As Vendex KBB became delisted as of August 3, 2004, we are
not required to adopt IFRS for Fiscal 2005. However, we do expect that IFRS will be adopted by us in
the near future.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum has been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands (‘‘Dutch GAAP’’). Dutch GAAP
differs from IFRS in respects that might be material to the financial information included in this
offering memorandum. In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own
examination of the issuer, the terms of the offering and the financial information set forth in this
offering memorandum. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisors for an
understanding of the differences between Dutch GAAP and IFRS and how those differences might
affect the financial information included in this offering memorandum.

Certain significant differences between Dutch GAAP and IFRS relevant to the consolidated
financial statements are summarized below. However, this summary does not purport to provide a
comprehensive analysis, including quantification, of such differences but rather it is a listing of potential
differences in accounting principles related to the consolidated financial statements. We have not
quantified these differences, nor undertaken a reconciliation of the Dutch GAAP financial information
to IFRS. Had we undertaken any such quantification or reconciliation, other potentially significant
accounting and disclosure differences that are not identified below may have come to our attention.
Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that the identified differences in the summary below
represent all of the principal differences relating to the financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum. Further, no attempt has been made to identify future differences between Dutch GAAP
and IFRS resulting from prescribed changes in accounting standards.

**Intangible fixed assets (business combinations and goodwill)**

Under both IFRS and Dutch GAAP, goodwill on acquisition is capitalized as an asset and
represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the aggregate fair values of the assets and
liabilities acquired. In determining the amount of goodwill, IFRS and Dutch GAAP include different
criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of (1) intangible assets apart from goodwill,
(2) provisions for terminating or reducing the activities of the acquiree, and (3) contingent liabilities.
Under IFRS, the cost of an acquisition does not include direct costs in respect of equity issued to
effect the acquisition; IFRS requires such costs to be recorded as a reduction of the proceeds of the
equity. Dutch GAAP allows—but does not require—such costs to be capitalized as part of the cost of
the acquisition.

Under Dutch GAAP, the amount of goodwill capitalized is amortized over the estimated useful
life, up to a maximum of 20 years, and an impairment test is carried out if there is an indication (or
triggering event) that goodwill may be impaired. Under IFRS goodwill may not be amortized but must
be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that it might be impaired. The specific impairment test model under IFRS differs from the more
general impairment test model under Dutch GAAP.

Until Fiscal 2000, we did not capitalize goodwill but directly wrote off goodwill from equity as
allowed under Dutch GAAP. We changed our accounting policy to capitalize goodwill prospectively,

A-1


-----

affecting acquisitions from Fiscal 2001. Should we adopt IFRS as our reporting basis in the future, we
are not required to apply IFRS retroactively to past business combinations (i.e., business combinations
that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS); the amount of goodwill deducted from equity in
respect of acquisitions until Fiscal 2000 would not be recognized in the IFRS opening balance sheet.

**Tangible fixed assets and leasing**

Under IFRS there is greater emphasis on specific components of the tangible fixed assets. If an
asset consists of components with different estimated useful lives, those components must be
depreciated separately according to their useful lives. Under Dutch GAAP, we depreciate tangible fixed
assets over the estimated useful life of the asset as a whole. Under IFRS, costs directly related to
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating, need to be
included in the cost price of the asset.

While IFRS and Dutch GAAP are similar in concept, certain differences exist with respect to the
classification of leases as operational or capital leases. Some of our sale and leaseback transactions that
qualify as operational leases under Dutch GAAP may qualify as financial leases under IFRS.

**Inventories**

Under Dutch GAAP we record our inventory using the retail-method, calculated at the average
purchase price less a provision for obsolescence, deterioration and other risks of holding inventories. In
general, our valuation method ensures that a margin impact due to markdown or obsolescence is
reported in the period in which store merchandise is marked-down or deemed to be obsolete, rather
than leaving the margin impact to occur when overdue or marked down merchandise is sold. Under
IFRS the inventory should be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which may lead
to margin effects due to obsolescence or markdowns being recorded at the moment of sale and not in
earlier periods. As a result, under IFRS, our provision for obsolescence, deterioration and other risks
of holding inventories, and therefore our overall inventory valuation, could differ from our current
valuation.

Under Dutch GAAP we do not allocate certain components of distribution and warehousing costs
or certain purchase discounts to our inventory. Under IFRS, we may need to allocate more components
of such distribution and warehousing costs to our inventory and take into account all purchase
discounts in determining the cost of our inventory.

**Debt issue costs**

Under IFRS direct costs related to the issue of debt are included in (i.e., deducted from) the
amount of the debt as presented on the balance sheet. Such costs are subsequently recognized as part
of interest expense under the ‘‘amortized cost’’ method of accounting for the debt to which these costs
relate. Under Dutch GAAP, we have capitalized debt issue costs as deferred financing costs, with
amortization of these costs applied to interest expense over the maturity of the respective loans.

**Provisions**

Under IFRS, provisions must be stated at their present value where the effect of the time value of
money is material. We state provisions at nominal value under Dutch GAAP. Under IFRS provisions
for reorganization are only recognized if the reorganization is started or communicated before or on
the balance sheet date. Under Dutch GAAP, such provision is permitted to be recognized if the
reorganization is started or communicated before the date of the preparation of the annual report. We
have recorded certain provisions, including provisions for maintenance, which would not be included
under IFRS.

A-2

**Employee benefits and pension liabilities**

Under IFRS the recognition of a provision for pensions and the related pension expense depends
on whether the plan is classified as a defined contribution plan or a defined benefit plan. In the case of
a defined benefit plan, a company is, in substance, underwriting the actuarial and investment risks
associated with the plan. IFRS requires that the actuarial value of defined benefit pension obligations
(determined under the projected-unit-credit method) less the fair value of plan assets is included in a
company’s balance sheet. IFRS requires the related amount of pension expense to be determined using
a specific allocation method, which may differ from amounts funded in the same year.

The main pension plans in existence at Vendex KBB would be classified as defined benefit plans
under IFRS.

Under Dutch GAAP currently in effect, companies may opt for one of the two methods of
accounting for pensions mentioned below. Vendex KBB and Victoria Acquisition III B.V. apply two
different accounting policies; effective 2005, the accounting policies applied by Vendex KBB with
respect to employment benefits will have to change to those applied by Victoria Acquisition III B.V.

Vendex KBB does not include the net amount of pension liabilities and assets for the main
pension plan on the balance sheet; the amount of pension expense recognized in the profit and loss
account generally equals the amount payable to these plans under the existing funding agreements. The
net pension liabilities and pension expense recognized under IFRS could be materially different from
the amounts included under Dutch GAAP as applied by Vendex KBB.

In accounting for employee benefits (including pensions), Victoria Acquisition III B.V. adopts the
new Dutch Annual Reporting Guideline 271 which will become mandatory under Dutch GAAP from
2005 onwards but encourages earlier application. Accounting under this Guideline is substantially
aligned with IFRS.

We are in the process of revising the terms of our main pension plan and related funding
agreement in order to fix our overall pension contributions and thereby minimize the extent of our
actuarial and investment risk in respect of pension obligations. The revised pension plan and funding
agreement—if and when effected—may change the current IFRS classification of this plan from a
defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan, as described above.

**Turnover and revenue recognition**

Under IFRS (and Dutch GAAP as from January, 1 2003) we recognize revenue where we act as
de facto agent (based on certain criteria) on a net basis, with only the net margin included in turnover.
These changes are reflected for all material items in our annual results for Fiscal 2002 and 2003, as
included in this offering memorandum. The annual results for Fiscal 2001 included in this offering
memorandum have not been adjusted to reflect these changes.

Until Fiscal 2002, the IFRS and Dutch GAAP requirements for revenue recognition were not
identical. In accordance with Dutch GAAP we have recognized certain sales and cost of sales on a
gross basis, based on the gross amount collected from the customer and the gross amount payable for
the products delivered by us. In accordance with changes in Dutch GAAP, we have changed our
revenue recognition policies as of and for Fiscal 2003.

**Financial instruments**

Under IFRS (IAS 39) all derivatives must be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in the profit and loss account, or—
under the cash flow hedge model—directly in equity, whether they are realized or not. Hedge
accounting is allowed only if certain strict criteria are met in respect of, inter alia, the type of hedge

A-3


-----

transaction, designation and documentation of the hedge relationship and hedge effectiveness. Under
the cash flow hedge model, gains and losses on derivative instruments directly reported in equity are
usually reclassified into the profit and loss account in the periods in which the profit and loss account is
affected by the hedged item. Under Dutch GAAP we do not separately include derivatives on the
balance sheet and instead net these against the underlying hedged transactions as and when these
occur.

IFRS requires that available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value, with changes in fair
value included in equity until realization or earlier impairment. Under Dutch GAAP we state certain
non-current financial assets at the lower of cost or expected realizable value.

Under Dutch GAAP, when determining whether financial instruments issued by a reporting entity
represent debt or equity, the classification needs to be determined in accordance with the substance of
the contractual arrangements and definitions of a liability and an equity instrument, rather than the
mere legal form of arrangements.

Under IFRS, financial instruments that contain an option for a cash settlement (whether at the
issuer’s or the holder’s discretion), should, in principle, be classified as a liability.

**Share based compensation**

Under Dutch GAAP, to the extent that the ultimate cost of share based compensation is (directly
or indirectly) borne by a reporting entity or its underlying group companies, the cost of such
compensation at grant date should only be recognized in the income statement to the extent that
instrument has an intrinsic value. There is no subsequent remeasurement of the compensation cost.

IFRS requires the recognition of all share-based payments in the financial statements irrespective
of whether the cost is ultimately borne by the reporting entity. All such transactions must be measured
at their fair values and recognized at grant date, with true-ups of costs for forfeitures due to nonmarket conditions and service conditions. If the arrangement gives one party the possibility for a cash
settlement, the fair value at grant date should be recognized as a liability, with remeasurement of the
liability through the income statement. The aforementioned description is based on IFRS 2 which
becomes effective as from 2005, but encourages earlier application.

**Presentation**

**_Extraordinary income and expenses_**

Until Fiscal 2002, the Dutch GAAP definition of extraordinary items was less strict than the IFRS
definition. Under IFRS and Dutch GAAP as from Fiscal 2003, presenting items as an extraordinary
item is limited to very rare events, such as expropriation of assets and natural disasters, while Dutch
GAAP has allowed a wider interpretation historically. Under Dutch GAAP, we recorded an
extraordinary charge in Fiscal 2001 that would not have been presented as extraordinary expenses
under IFRS.

**_Statement of changes in equity_**

IFRS requires a statement of changes in equity to be included as one of the primary financial
statements. Under Dutch GAAP, we present the changes in the various components of equity in the
notes to our consolidated financial statements.

**_Deferred tax assets_**

Under Dutch GAAP, we classify deferred tax assets under current assets. IFRS would require
classification of deferred tax assets under non-current assets.

A-4


-----

**_Presentation in the cash flow statement_**

IFRS contains stricter requirements requiring classification of cash flows by operating, investing
and financing activities. We present cash flow from operating activities exclusive of cash flow from
discontinued activities, which are included under cash flows from investing activities.

**_Consolidation and investments held for sale_**

Under Dutch GAAP, investments in subsidiaries are generally consolidated until the date of sale.

Under IFRS, the assets and liabilities related to investments held for sale (a disposal group) are to
be presented separately in the balance sheet. The aforementioned description is based on IFRS 2 which
becomes effective as from 2005 but encourages earlier application.

**_Disclosure_**

Under IFRS, various additional financial statement disclosures would be required as compared to
those currently made under Dutch GAAP.

**KONINKLIJKE VENDEX KBB N.V.**

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**General**

The amounts stated in these notes pertain to the consolidated figures and are given in millions of
euro. The notes to the Company balance sheet and profit and loss account are limited to items that
differ from the corresponding items in the consolidated balance sheet and that are of material
significance. The Company profit and loss account has been prepared in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2:402 of the Netherlands Civil Code.

**Changes in the principles for recording and presenting turnover**

**Net turnover**

In accordance with a change to the Dutch guidelines for income recognition (RJ 270 profit and
loss account), the principles for recognizing and presenting turnover have been changed as of
February 1, 2003.

Guideline 270 sets out detailed criteria in relation to the definition of income and when turnover
is to be recognized.

The table below shows the effect of the change per year on the net turnover per business unit:

**Financial year 2003/2004** **Financial year 2002/2003**
**As per** **As per** **As per** **As per**
**new** **former** **new** **former**

V&D . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 812 816 0% 855 856 0%
Bijenkorf . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 399 425 (6%) 389 420 (7%)
DIY . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,220 1,225 0% 1,063 1,066 0%
Fashion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 457 455 0% 456 455 0%
Consumer Electronics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 603 585 3% 615 589 4%
Other activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42 42 0% 38 38 0%

Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,451 4,487 (1%) 4,327 4,357 (1%)

The main reasons for the differences between the net turnover as per the former definition and as
per the new definition are as follows:

— At HEMA, the point-of-sale turnover of the franchisees’ photo service and restaurant
activities were formerly presented as turnover, whereas under the new guideline only supplies
to franchisees may be presented as net turnover (effect -EUR 19 million);

— Sales by concession holders at Bijenkorf were formerly presented as turnover, whereas under
the new guideline only the fee may be presented as net turnover (effect -EUR 25 million);

— At Consumer Electronics, turnover generated by sales of services such as service certificates
and extended guarantee insurance were formerly presented as other income, whereas the new
guideline states that these should be presented as turnover (effect +EUR 12 million)

The differences pertain almost exclusively to the presentation. There are no implications for the
result or the opening equity.

The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly.

**KONINKLIJKE VENDEX KBB N.V.**

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**Consolidation principles**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of Royal Vendex KBB N.V.
(‘‘Vendex KBB’’) and its group companies; group companies are participating interests in which Vendex
KBB directly or indirectly has a controlling interest, or participating interests for which Vendex KBB
runs the majority of the economic risks or is entitled to the greater share of the economic gains.
Vendex KBB holds, either directly or indirectly, a 100% interest in the following activities (which are
the most important ones for the group):

� HEMA � Consumer Electronics
� V&D � Dixons
� Bijenkorf � Dynabyte
� DIY � It’s
� Praxis � Modern Electronics
� Brico � Prijstopper
� Formido � Other activities
� Keur Group � Schaap & Citroen
� Fashion � AudioSonic
� Claudia Str¨ater � IT Services
� Hunkem¨oller � CFS (Cards & Financial Services)
� M&S

A detailed list of the group companies included in the consolidation can be found at the Chamber
of Commerce.

The results on transactions between consolidated companies are eliminated. Participating interests
cease to be considered group companies from the moment when Vendex KBB no longer exercises
decision-making control.

The results of group companies acquired or sold are included in the consolidated profit and loss
account to the extent that they are achieved in the period during which the companies concerned are
group companies. The results of disposals are included in the consolidated profit and loss account in
the operating result on discontinued activities.

Vendex KBB has filed a statement of joint and several liability, within the meaning of
Section 2:403 of the Netherlands Civil Code, for almost all its Dutch group companies. Those
companies invoke their right to exemption from filing financial statements in accordance with the
aforementioned Section of the Civil Code.

**Acquisitions and disposals**

At the end of June 2003, the group acquired a 100% interest in the Belgian activities of the
French do-it-yourself group Leroy Merlin for EUR 65 million, including goodwill of EUR 51 million.
The activities comprise six DIY-stores with garden centers. The figures for these acquired activities are
consolidated as from 1 July 2003. The name will be changed into Brico Plan-it. In addition, Praxis took
over a number of franchisees during the financial year.

At the end of March 2002, agreement was reached with the Belgian company GIB on the takeover
of the DIY group Brico Belgium NV, with 97 outlets in Belgium (including 56 franchise stores) as well
as companies operating DIY chains in France, Spain and Portugal. The transaction was cleared by the
European Commission in mid-June 2002. In connection with this takeover, Vendex KBB reached an

F-9


-----

**KONINKLIJKE VENDEX KBB N.V.**

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

agreement to sell its shares in the French, Spanish and Portuguese Brico companies to the French
company Leroy Merlin, contingent upon clearance from the competent competition authorities. Vendex
KBB received the purchase price for the shares of the French, Spanish and Portuguese companies from
Leroy Merlin in advance, these funds being used to pay part of the price payable to GIB. As collateral
for the performance of its obligations vis-`a-vis Leroy Merlin, Vendex KBB pledged 75% of the shares
of Brico Belgium NV to Leroy Merlin. In February 2003, the French and Portuguese competition
authorities cleared the transfer of the shares of the French and Portuguese Brico companies and the
transfer to Leroy Merlin was completed. In the second half of 2003, the Spanish competition
authorities cleared the transfer of the shares of the Spanish Brico companies and the transfer to Leroy
Merlin was completed.

The sale of six group companies was completed on July 31, 2002, in the transaction under which
the Hans Anders opticians group of companies, Siebel the jewellers, Kijkshop, Perry Sport, Pr´enatal
and Scapino were transferred to the investment company CVC. (Retail Network Company). In
addition, part of Vendex KBB IT Services was disposed of in November 2002 to PinkRoccade and
America Today was sold in December 2002 in a management buyout.

**Principles for valuation and determination of results**

**General**

The principles for the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the determination of results are
based on historical cost, unless stated otherwise. Unless otherwise indicated, assets and liabilities are
stated at face value.

**Use of estimates**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are made by
management which could affect the reported amounts as at balance sheet date and the income and
expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Foreign currencies**

Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance
sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account, except for
translation differences on net investments in participating interests abroad, which are presented in the
shareholders’ equity, net of any taxation. The results from the participating interests abroad are
included at the average exchange rates. Exchange rate differences on securities listed on the stock
exchange are treated in the same way as changes in the value of those securities. Exchange rate
differences stemming from commodities transactions are presented as Cost of sales, and any remaining
exchange rate differences are presented as Financial income and expenses.

**Intangible fixed assets**

Any goodwill included in the acquisition of participating interests is carried at cost, and is
amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Capitalized lease rights are amortised over the term of the lease contracts or over the period of
security of tenure as stipulated by the applicable legal system, also up to a maximum of 20 years. As
from 2002/03, software purchased and the related implementing costs and licences are classified as
intangible fixed assets. Software and licences are amortised over three or five years.

F-10


-----

**KONINKLIJKE VENDEX KBB N.V.**

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

Effective as of February 1, 2001 goodwill paid on acquisition of participating interests is presented
under intangible fixed assets. This complies with the amended Guidelines for Annual Reporting in The
Netherlands. This change does not materially affect results over the fiscal year 2001/02 or group equity
as of January 31, 2002. Goodwill paid was formerly charged directly to shareholders’ equity.

**Tangible fixed assets**

Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost. Assets that have been brought into use are depreciated on
a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life per category of fixed assets or parts thereof, with
the following maximum terms:

� Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 years (100 years for foundations)
� Technical installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
� Equipment and shop fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 years
� Computer hardware and cash register systems . 5 years

Fixed assets with a temporary right of use are depreciated over the terms of those rights. Land is
not depreciated. The lump-sum payments for land leases included in this item are depreciated on a
linear basis over the period for which the land lease has been bought off.

The original acquisition price of fixed assets to which the group holds the beneficiary title pursuant
to a financial lease agreement are taken as being the net present value of the lease instalments over
the entire lease period.

Costs of major repairs are charged directly against the result.

**Financial fixed assets**

The non-consolidated participating interests over whose commercial and financial policies the
Company exercises significant control are valued at the proportional share in the net asset value,
according to Vendex KBB’s principles for valuation and determination of results.

Participating interests over whose commercial and financial policies no significant control is
exercised and the other non-listed securities are carried at the lower of cost and the expected realisable
value. A detailed list of non-consolidated participating interests can be found at the Chamber of
Commerce.

Receivables from non-consolidated participating interests and other receivables are stated at
nominal value less a provision for doubtful debts where appropriate.

**Impairment of fixed assets**

The book value of fixed assets is assessed for impairments whenever events or changes in
circumstances give cause to do so. For the purposes of such assessments, the assets are divided into
groups based on separately identifiable and largely independent cash flows. The assessments are made
at store level. In the event of impairment, the book value of the assets is written down to their
realisable value.

**Inventories**

Inventories are included at average purchase price, minus a provision for obsolescence,
deterioration and other risks of holding inventories.

F-11

**KONINKLIJKE VENDEX KBB N.V.**

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**Debtors**

Debtors are shown at nominal value minus a provision for doubtful debts where appropriate.

**Provisions**

The provision for deferred taxation represents future tax liabilities due to temporary differences
between the book values of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and for tax purposes, calculated
at the standard rate.

Self-administered pension commitments are valued in accordance with actuarial principles, using an
interest rate of 4%. Commitments stemming from guaranteed income schemes for participants in early
retirement schemes are valued in accordance with actuarial principles, using an interest rate of 4%.

Provisions for redundancy schemes and staff who have taken early retirement are valued at the
nominal amounts. Provisions for disability benefits for employees are based on the nominal value of the
expected payment commitments in connection with the actual disability of the present and former
employees.

**Long-term liabilities**

Liabilities are carried at the nominal value. The net present value of future lease installments in
connection with loans and financial lease agreements is also included. Repayment commitments on
long-term liabilities that are payable within one year are included under short-term loans.

**Profit and loss account**

_Net turnover comprises the sales value of the sold goods and services at the moment of delivery,_
net of VAT and sales discounts. For the Company’s own stores, this figure is based on the delivery to
consumers, for franchisees on the delivery of goods to franchisees on the account and risk of the group,
as well as the franchise fees. For concession holders the figure is the concessionary fee.

The cost of sales comprises that part of the value of the goods sold that is absorbed by costs,
including the costs attributed to the purchasing organisation and the transport and warehousing activity.

_Selling and distribution costs are the costs that are attributable to the sales activities, such as the_
costs of the stores, including the results on disposals of such establishments and the results from
redevelopment projects. The results from redevelopment projects are presented on a
percentage-of-completion basis according to the Company’s share in the project.

The general administrative expenses are the costs of general management of the group companies,
the costs of group management and all costs that do not qualify as either cost of sales or selling and
distribution costs.

_Other operating income pertains mainly to income from operating activities that does not constitute_
turnover.

_Financial income and expenses covers all interest income and expenses attributable to the reporting_
year on a time-proportionate basis. This item also includes the exchange rate differences that do not
pertain to participating interests or commodities transactions, and the gains and losses on hedging
operations involving financial derivatives. Financial income and expenses also includes the refinancing
costs that are attributable to the reporting year.

**KONINKLIJKE VENDEX KBB N.V.**

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

_Changes in the value of and income from receivables forming part of fixed assets and in the value of_
_and income from securities. On disposal of non-consolidated participating interests or non-listed_
securities, the difference between the sales proceeds and the book value is presented as income, as also
is any realised revaluation of listed securities. This item also covers changes in the value of financial
fixed assets, with the exception of other securities, as well as dividends received from other securities,
after deduction of non-recoverable withholding tax.

The calculation of the taxation takes into account permanent differences between the result for
reporting purposes and the result for tax purposes. Claims for tax relief are taken into account insofar
as it is reasonable to assume that recovery or realisation will be possible.

**Cash flow statement**

The cash flow statement has been prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows in foreign
currencies are restated into euro at the average exchange rates for the relevant periods. Cash flows
generated by discontinued activities are presented as part of the cash flow from investing activities.

**Segmentation**

The basis for the primary segmentation is the division into six business units within Vendex KBB:
HEMA, V&D, Bijenkorf, DIY, Fashion and Consumer Electronics. Property, other activities/holding
and discontinued activities also form distinct segments. The division into segments matches the
organisation of the core activities and responsibilities within Vendex KBB. One of the features of this
structure is that the group constituents have a high degree of independence.

The principles for valuation and determination of results for the segments are identical to the
principles used to prepare and present the financial statements.

The operating capital of the business units consists of the total of the assets minus short-term
liabilities and operating provisions. The operating capital of the six business units does not include any
interest-bearing receivables or liabilities from other segments, corporation tax receivables or liabilities
(whether or not deferred), or any bank account credit. The corporation tax receivables or liabilities and
financing are reflected in the ‘‘other activities/holding’’ segment.

The secondary segmentation is based on a division in geographic locations and is included as of
2002/03.

**Comparative figures**

Where necessary, the classification has been adjusted to allow comparisons.

The participating interests include the interests in Betafin, Alant Medical and Vision Clinics. As
per January 31, 2003 the participating interests also include the Brico interests in France, Spain and
Portugal. These interests have been stated at the selling price less the amount paid in advance by Leroy
Merlin (leaving a net figure of 0). The amounts receivable from these international companies have
also been netted off with the advance payment.

The 2002/03 decrease in the amounts receivable from participating interests relates to an
exceptional diminution in value of the group’s interests in several Brazilian shopping centers. The other
amounts receivable include a long-term loan to Retail Network Company of EUR 11 million (EUR 10
million), as well as the remaining receivable of EUR 14 million (EUR 17 million) in connection with
the settlement of the interests in Brazilian shopping centers.

**Current assets**

**(4) Inventories**

The inventories consist almost exclusively of trade inventories. The provision for obsolete
inventories is EUR 32 million (EUR 29 million). The increase in inventories stems mainly from the
acquisition of the Belgian activities of Leroy Merlin.

- The comparing figures for 2002/03 have been adjusted to allow comparison; debts in an amount of
EUR 9 million have been reclassified from other loans to lease commitments.

The bank loan is a revolving credit facility from a syndicate of banks, which can be drawn and
repaid as and when necessary. The facility amount is EUR 550 million. The outstanding amount under
the facility must be repaid no later than November 27, 2006. The interest rate is floating, depending on
the interest period selected by the Company, plus a margin. The margin varies between 0.85% and
2.10%, depending on the ratio of net interest-bearing debt to operating result from continued activities
before amortisation and depreciation. Payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by twenty Dutch
subsidiaries. Various events constitute a default, amongst others if Vendex KBB does not comply with a
debt ratio and/or an interest-coverage ratio:

   - Debt ratio: at the end of every quarter, the ratio of net interest-bearing debt to operating result
from continued activities before amortisation and depreciation and before extraordinary items
for the last four quarters must be no more than 3 (in the third quarter of each year this ratio
must be no more than 3.4);

   - Interest-coverage ratio: at the end of each quarter, the ratio of operating result before
amortisation and depreciation and before extraordinary items for the last four quarters to total
net interest must be no less than 4.

The mortgage loan is a credit facility with a fixed principal amount of EUR 250 million, with
annual repayments. Every year, an amount of EUR 7.5 million is to be repaid on this loan, with the
remainder of the principal falling due on November 28, 2010. The interest rate is floating, based on
3-monthly EURIBOR plus a fixed margin. Approximately half the value of the property owned by the
Company has been encumbered in favour of this facility. This concerns HEMA, V&D and Bijenkorf

premises. Various events constitute a default, amongst others if Vendex KBB does not comply with a
debt ratio and/or an interest-coverage ratio:

   - Debt ratio: at the end of every quarter, the ratio of net interest-bearing debt to operating result
from continued activities before amortisation and depreciation and before extraordinary items
for the last four quarters must be no more than 3.5;

   - Interest-coverage ratio: at the end of each quarter, the ratio of operating result from continued
activities before amortisation and depreciation and before extraordinary items for the last four
quarters to total net interest charge must be no less than 3.5.

Vendex KBB must also ensure that the outstanding principal of the mortgage loan is no more than
70% of the market value of the property that is encumbered.

Senior subordinated notes are issued up to a total principal amount of EUR 200 million. The
interest rate on the senior subordinated notes has been fixed for the entire maturity of the loan at
7.375%. The notes must be repaid in full no later than November 15, 2010. Payment of interest and
principal is guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by twenty Dutch subsidiaries. The market value
of the senior subordinated notes is EUR 214 million.

As at the balance sheet date, Vendex KBB complies with all the aforementioned ratios.

In connection with the financing agreements, Vendex KBB and its group companies have
undertaken not to create any security interests on their assets without prior written approval. This
undertaking is subject to a number of exceptions.

In determining the average effective interest rate, the effects of Interest Rate Swaps have been
incorporated. As at the balance sheet date, Interest Rate Swaps in the sum of EUR 477 million
(EUR 658 million) were outstanding. Of this amount, EUR 182 million (EUR 477 million) mature in
one to five years, while the remainder matures within one year. The market values of these hedging
instruments are not recognized in the balance sheet.

As at the balance sheet date, Vendex KBB had almost EUR 150 million of unused committed
credit lines at its disposal.

The costs related to the loan package, totaling EUR 17 million, have been capitalized and will be
amortised over the maturity of the respective loans. The result for the present financial year includes
an amortisation charge of EUR 1 million for these costs.

The subordinated loan relates to a credit facility from a syndicate of lending institutions. The
principal repayable under this loan is subordinated to all liabilities of Vendex KBB. The loan has to be
repaid no later than January 22, 2004. The interest payable is variable, depending on the interest
period of three or six months opted for by the company, and is based on the relevant interbank interest
rate plus a mark-up. The loan becomes callable immediately if the ratio of the operating result before
depreciation and amortisation to the total interest charge falls below 3.

Of the amount of the syndicated loan maturing after more than one year, EUR 230 million falls
due at the end of February 2004. An amount of EUR 185 million of the syndicated loan is subject to
the condition that the ratio of the net interest-bearing debt to the operating result before depreciation
and amortisation does not exceed 3.

As at balance sheet Vendex KBB satisfied these ratios.

In determining the average effective interest rate, the effects of using interest rate swaps have been
taken into account. As at balance sheet date, EUR 658 million (EUR 726 million) was outstanding in
the form of interest rate swaps. Of these amounts, EUR 477 million (EUR 658 million) had a
remaining term of one to five years and the remaining contracts matured within one year. These
hedging instruments have not been recognised in the balance sheet.

In connection with amounts owed to lending institutions, Vendex KBB and its major group
companies have undertaken not to encumber their assets with any collateral rights without prior written
authorisation from the lending institutions.

As at balance sheet date Vendex KBB had unutilised credit lines in excess of EUR 330 million.

A lawsuit is pending relating to the merger between Vendex N.V. and N.V. Royal Bijenkorf Beheer
which was formalised on July 16, 1999. The suit claims annulment of the merger or alternatively a
judgement awarding damages. In an interim judgement, the court ruled that expert advice be sought.
The Company has instituted appeal proceedings against this judgement. The Company does not

**KONINKLIJKE VENDEX KBB N.V.**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**Notes to the segmentation**

(1) The operating result on retail activities for V&D is affected by a one-off charge of approximately
EUR 80 million (EUR 48 million) for reorganisation.

(2) From July 1, 2003, the consolidated figures for the DIY segment include the figures for the
Belgian activities of Leroy Merlin. In the comparative figures, the figures for Brico are included in
the consolidation as from April 1, 2002.

(3) In connection with the mortgage taken out on the property, the split of the assets over the retail
segment (Hema, V&D and Bijenkorf) and the property segment has been reassessed. As a result,
an amount of EUR 14 million has been transferred for technical installations from V&D retail to
the property segment. Together with the accompanying depreciation, this has a downward effect on
the return on operating capital of property. The comparative figures have not been adjusted.

(4) The other fixed assets included in the segment for other activities/holding consist mainly of
financial fixed assets (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements); the other current assets
mainly concern the tax receivable (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements); the
provisions mainly pertain to the deferred tax provision (see note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements). The result on the other activities/holding includes a one-off cost of EUR 6 million,
stemming from the termination of the group pension contract. The comparative figure for the
segment includes a one-off cost of EUR 15 million for the restructuring and streamlining of
Vendex KBB IT Services.

(5) The result from discontinued activities consists of a) a result of EUR 4 million stemming from the
settlement of the activities of FAO Schwarz, terminated in the financial year 2001/02, and b) a
negative result of EUR 7 million stemming from the settlement of the spin-off of a former group
company from the group pension contract. The comparative figure for the discontinued activities
segment comprises the net book result from the sale of 6 group constituents to Retail Network
Company (EUR 145 million) and the sale of America Today, as well as the pre-tax operating result
of these companies and of Dixtone (EUR 7 million) up until the respective moments of sale.

(6) The operating result includes an amount of EUR 11 million from released provisions. The portion
of the maintenance provision that was not needed is EUR 6 million, and the portion of the
provision for discontinued activities that was not needed is EUR 4 million. In the previous year,
the release pertained to the provision for obsolete stock.

(7) The amortisation and depreciation include the impairments of EUR 6 million for V&D and
EUR 2 million for M&S.

The 2003/04 increase in the salaries and social security charges, including pension schemes for the
continued activities, is to a large extent the result of the acquisition of the Belgian activities of Leroy
Merlin, which are consolidated as from July 1, 2003.

The 2002/03 increase in salaries and social security charges, including the costs of pension schemes
of the continued activities, was largely due to the acquisition of Brico, which has been included in the
consolidation as from April 1, 2002. The pension scheme costs were higher as a result of the increased
pension contributions and the costs of the newly introduced ‘‘pre-pension’’ scheme, which replaces the
existing early retirement schemes.

**Pensions (financial statement 2003/04)**

Approximately 90% of the employees over twenty years of age in the Netherlands participate in
Stichting Pensioenfonds Vendex KBB. The remaining 10% participates in a sector’s pension fund or an
insured pension scheme.

**Stichting Pensioenfonds Vendex KBB (financial statement 2003/04)**

This foundation is the entity charged with implementing the Vendex KBB pension scheme, as well
as the pension schemes of the former Vendex and KBB. The pension scheme is based on the average
pay system with post-indexing, and stipulates that indexing will only be effected if, in the view of the
foundation’s board, the financial means permit. The funding of the foundation is arranged by way of an
agreement with the Company, and is based on contributions charged on the pension-giving wages. The
division of the contributions between employer and employee is set out in the Collective Labour
Agreement (CAO).

The board has equal representation, with eight members appointed by the active participants and
retired employees and eight members appointed by the employer, and is entrusted with implementing
the scheme, the contribution and indexing policy and the management of the funds in the broadest
sense. The pension scheme is self-administered. The majority of the insurance-related risks are covered
through reinsurance. The capital management has been outsourced to two capital management firms.
The foundation publishes its own financial statements. Its financial year runs from January 1 to
December 31.

At year-end 2003, the number of policyholders was approximately 85,000, consisting of around
30,000 active members, 40,000 paid-up members and 15,000 retired members.

The shares and property and the fixed-interest securities are stated at market value. The pension
commitments consist of the net present value (based on 4% standard rate of interest) of the nominal
claims as at December 31, 2003, and are calculated based on the GBM/V 1995–2000 mortality table,
with two-year and one-year backward age adjustment, respectively. A 2% mark-up is applied for
paying-out costs.

The foundation’s commitments are fully covered by its capital. The minimum coverage–in
accordance with the supervisory authority’s requirements, plus a mark-up for general risks–is 103% for
this foundation.

In view of the financial prospects toward the end of 2001, the decision about indexing as from
January 1, 2002 was postponed. Until this decision is made, advances are being paid out to the retired
participants. In view of the coverage as at December 31, 2003, the board of the foundation has set
indexing at 0% as from January 1, 2004, which is the same as for 2003.

**_Other pension schemes_**

Directors of the operating companies participate in Stichting Directiepensioenfonds Vendex KBB.
The participants have a mitigated final-salary scheme, with a pre-pension age of 62. The financing of
this foundation is arranged by way of an agreement with the Company, and is based on contributions
charged on the pension-giving wages, as well as on an adjustment mechanism for variances in coverage.
The retired participants have been informed that the decision about indexing as from January 1, 2004
has been postponed until further notice. In view of general developments of pensions, this scheme will
also be reviewed. The pensions of the members and former members of the Board of Management are
placed with Nationale Nederlanden.

**(19) Financial instruments**

Vendex KBB uses financial instruments as part of the ordinary course of business, which are
presented as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, as well as financial derivatives.

The financial instruments included in the balance sheet consist almost entirely of financial fixed
assets, trade debtors, other receivables, cash, long-term liabilities and current liabilities. The estimated
market value of these financial instruments is approximately the same as their book value, and is based
on the net present value.

In order to limit the impact on results of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, the
Company uses Interest Rate Swaps. These financial derivatives are used to fix the interest rate on
underlying loans. The market value of these financial derivatives represents a liability of EUR 12
million (EUR 19 million) (receivable of EUR 2 million). These financial derivatives are not included in
the balance sheet. No hedging instruments are used for securities or other receivables.

Financial derivatives for hedging interest rate risks and exchange rate risks on current purchasing
orders are not included in the balance sheet, but at the same time recorded with the hedged
transactions. Cash flows from financial derivatives are recognised as financial income and expenses in
the period up to the maturity of the instruments concerned.

In the case of early repayment of loans, the market value of any redundant hedge is ascertained
and the gains and losses represented by that position are recognised in the profit and loss accounts for
the year.

The gold loan, the principal of which is expressed in quantities, has been concluded with the object
of absorbing fluctuations in the value of gold stocks held by one of the Vendex KBB formats.

The credit risk consists of the loss that would arise if any of the parties to the contract were to be
in default on their contractual obligations. Except for receivables included in the ‘‘Other receivables’’

item, Vendex KBB is not exposed to any significant credit risk, with regard to its individual customers
or counterparties. There is also a credit risk in case a counterparty to a contract involving financial
derivatives defaults on its obligations. This is, however, unlikely given the creditworthiness of the
counterparties with which financial derivatives are contracted.

**(30) Stock option schemes**

**_Financial statements 2003/04_**

In the reporting year, the Company awarded option rights to depositary receipts for ordinary
shares to approximately 100 managers and directors. The purpose of this option scheme is to bring the
interests of management in line with those of the shareholders, by granting them an additional
performance-related reward as a long-term stimulus for the Company’s affairs. The intention is that this
will increase the shareholder value. The exercise price of the options is the stock exchange price when
the options are accepted. The number of options to be awarded is generally a percentage of the fixed
salary (varying from 60% to 150%) divided by the exercise price. Grants of option rights are also
restricted to 1% of the number of outstanding ordinary shares per year. The options awarded up to
year-end 2001 have terms of five years. Options granted in 2002 and 2003 have terms of seven years.

When an option right is exercised and/or an employee announces the termination of his or her
employment contract with the Company or with any other business affiliated with the Company, the
employee is obliged to repay to the Company a percentage of the gain realised by exercising the option
(after tax): in the first year of the option term this percentage is 99%; in the second year of the option
term 66%; in the third year of the option term 33%; and after the third year of the option term 0%.
The Company can repurchase the depositary receipts of ordinary shares needed for exercising the
option rights, in order to prevent dilution of the profit per share as a result of the option scheme. As
at January 31, 2004, the Company held 1,509,906 repurchased depositary receipts of ordinary shares for
the option scheme. At year-end of the reporting year, the members of the Supervisory Board did not
hold any option rights to depositary receipts of ordinary shares in Vendex KBB.

Options granted before 1999 pertain to shares in Vendex International N.V. before the demergers
of Vedior and Vendex Food Group, and currently entitle the holder to a combination of 1 share in
Vendex KBB, 0.9868 shares in Vedior N.V. and 0.7 shares in Laurus N.V.

(1) Options in Vendex International: it was decided in 2001 that the Company would provide compensation for
the personal income tax paid on the grant of the options (for this series, the marginal rate on 7.5% of the
exercise price), if the share price, including the tax paid, has not been in the money for a period of three
months during the term in which the options can be exercised and the employment contract has not been
terminated. The costs of financing incurred by the employee in question will also be compensated.

(2) For options in Vendex KBB, the Company provides compensation for [5]⁄8 (12.5% of 20%) of the personal
income tax paid on the grant of the options (for this series, the marginal rate on 20% of the exercise price) if
the recipient is still employed by the Company three years after acceptance. The Company also provides
compensation for [3]⁄8 (7.5% of 20%) of the personal income tax paid on the grant of the options if the share
price, including the tax paid, has not been in the money for a period of three months during the term in
which the options can be exercised and the employment contract has not been terminated. The costs of
financing incurred by the employee in question will also be compensated.

(3) As Mr. Goeminne is active as a member of the Board of Management since August 1, 2003, his options are
included in those of directors; in the previous year, they were included in the options of ‘‘other employees’’.

in Vendex KBB.

As at January 31, 2004, the members of the Supervisory Board do not own any depositary receipts
of ordinary shares in Vendex KBB. As at January 31, 2003, Mrs K.M.H. Peijs owned 223 depositary

**(32) Remuneration of members of the Board of Management**

**_Financial statements 2003/04_**

The remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is composed as follows: a basic
fixed salary, pension insurance based on mitigated final pay with a pensionable age of 62, a bonus of up
to 100% of the basic fixed salary (the principal criterion for which is the development of the net result
per share), and an annual grant of options worth up to 150% of the annual fixed salary.

The options are granted in the month of April, a few days after the publication of the annual
figures. The exercise price is the stock exchange price when the options are accepted. In principle, the
options can be exercised immediately, although almost all (99%) of the after-tax profit from exercising
the options must be paid to the Company if the options are exercised within one year after acceptance;
if they are exercised within two years after acceptance, 66% of the profit must be paid to the Company
and if they are exercised within three years after acceptance, 33% of the profit must be paid to the
Company.

The table below shows the salary costs for 2003/04 and 2002/03 and the bonus for 2003/04 and
2002/03 that will be paid after 2003/04 and 2002/03.

**(32) Remuneration of members of the Board of Management**

The following should be noted in connection with the table above:

(1) The column ‘‘Compensation of tax and interest’’ shows the compensation of tax and interest on
option rights granted in the past, as described on the notes to the option schemes.

(2) Mr. Goeminne is active as a member of the Board of Management since 1 August 2003;
remuneration for 6 months in 2003/04.

(3) Mr. Hunfeld resigned with effect from 31 December 2003. In addition to the remuneration shown
in the table, Mr. Hunfeld received a severance payment of EUR 780,000, as contractually agreed.

**_Financial statements 2002/03_**

New legislation relating to the disclosure of management pay with effect has resulted in a different
method of accounting for the remuneration of members of the Board of Management as from 2002/03.
The table below includes:

   - the salary expenses relating to the year under review and the bonus for the year payable after
the end of the year. Previously, the bonus disclosed was that actually paid in the year under
review. The amount of the bonus essentially reflects earnings per share.

  - the bonus column also includes the amounts paid in respect of taxation and interest on option
rights granted in the past, as described in the notes to the stock option scheme. For the year
under review, this concerns an amount of 288 for Mr. Hamming, an amount of 92 for Mr. Smits
and an amount of 4 for the former members of the Board of Management.

   - the actual pension charges; previously, an average pension contribution was calculated on an
actuarial basis for the members of the Board of Management, as applicable to all the senior
management of Vendex KBB.

   - the total amounts for the previous year, restated in accordance with the new system.

**(4)** **Possible Sale of IMpact**

In connection with the evaluation of the possible sale of all or part of our Consumer Electronics
business unit, discussions have been progressing with a number of interested parties. Since July 31,
2004, the company commenced negotiations regarding the sale of its interest in IMpact. If a transaction
is concluded at the price forming the basis of the current negotiations, management of the company
expects that the disposal would result in a book loss of approximately A30 million, which management
believes is tax deductible, resulting in an estimated book loss on disposal after tax of A20 million. If no
transaction is concluded, management believes it has opportunities to improve the operating
profitability of IMpact. The company did not include an impairment loss in its books in respect of
IMpact in these interim consolidated financial statements for the half year February 1, to July 31. Had
an impairment loss been recorded based on the price forming the basis of the current negotiations, the
company would have recorded the following accounting entries on its books: (i) a reduction in
operating result of approximately A30 million, (ii) a reduction in net result of approximately A20 million
and (iii) a reduction in group equity of approximately A20 million. Pending the outcome of
negotiations, including the preparation and negotiation of definitive documents, management of the
company has not made any decision to sell IMpact at the price forming the basis of the current
negotiations, and a transaction may or may not occur.

**VICTORIA ACQUISITION III B.V.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET**

BASIS OF PREPARATION

**General**

The balance sheet has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the
Netherlands. All amounts are stated in millions of Euro unless indicated otherwise.

Victoria Acquisition III B.V. (‘‘VA III’’) was incorporated on April 26, 2004.

VA III is a holding company whose wholly owned subsidiary, VDXK Acquisition B.V., acquired
virtually the entire share capital of Koninklijke Vendex KBB N.V. (‘‘Vendex KBB’’), a Dutch listed
company, between July 5 and July 26, 2004 (‘‘the Acquisition’’). After August 1, 2004 VA III initiated
proceedings to purchase the remaining shares (less than 1 percent) and delist Vendex KBB’s shares
from Euronext Amsterdam.

Activities of VA III prior to the Acquisition of Vendex KBB were limited to the due diligence
process and arranging of financing facilities.

**Consolidation principles**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of VA III and its group
companies (collectively referred to as the ‘‘Group’’), group companies are participating interests in
which VA III directly or indirectly has a controlling interest, or participating interests for which VA III
runs the majority of the economic risks or is entitled to the greater share of the economic gains.
Vendex KBB holds, either directly or indirectly, a 100% interest in the following activities:

**• HEMA** **• Consumer Electronics**

**• V&D** Dixons
Dynabyte

**• Bijenkorf**
It’s

**• DIY** Modern Electronics
Prijstopper
Praxis
Brico

**• Other activities**
Formido
Keur-groep Schaap & Citroen
AudioSonic

**• Fashion** IT Services
CFS (Cards & Financial Services)
Claudia Str¨ater
Hunkem¨oller
M&S

A detailed list of the group companies of Vendex KBB can be found at the Chamber of
Commerce.

At August 1, 2004 VA III (indirectly) owned 99.3% of the shares of Vendex KBB. As squeeze-out
procedures have been initiated after August 1, 2004 the assets and liabilities of Vendex KBB and its
subsidiaries have been consolidated for 100%, and the estimated amount involved in acquiring the
remainder of the outstanding shares has been accrued.

F-58


-----

**VICTORIA ACQUISITION III B.V.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (Continued)**

The activities of VA III’s 100% owned intermediate holding and other companies (VDXK
Acquisition B.V. and Victoria Finance B.V.) are also consolidated.

The results on transactions between consolidated companies are eliminated.

The results of group companies acquired or sold are included in the consolidated profit and loss
account to the extent that they are achieved in the period during which the companies concerned are
group companies. This balance sheet includes the results of Vendex KBB from July 5 onwards.

**PRINCIPLES FOR VALUATION AND DETERMINATION OF RESULTS**

**General**

The principles for the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the determination of results are
based on historical cost, unless stated otherwise. Unless otherwise indicated, assets and liabilities are
stated at face value.

**Use of estimates**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions are made by
management which could affect the reported amounts as at balance sheet date and the income and
expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

**Foreign currencies**

Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance
sheet date. The resulting exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account, except for
translation differences on net investments in participating interests abroad, which are presented in the
shareholders’ equity, net of any taxation. The results from the participating interests abroad are
included at the average exchange rates. Exchange rate differences on securities listed on the stock
exchange are treated in the same way as changes in the value of those securities. Exchange rate
differences stemming from commodities transactions are presented as Cost of sales, and any remaining
exchange rate differences are presented as financial income and expenses.

**Intangible fixed assets**

Any goodwill included in the acquisition of participating interests is carried at cost, and is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between costs incurred in and directly related to the
acquisition, and the fair value of the net assets acquired. With respect to the Vendex KBB acquisition,
these accounts reflect only a preliminary estimate of fair value adjustments, including an increase in
tangible fixed assets based on valuation reports, a decrease in certain assets based on potential
realizable value and the recognition of an employee benefit liability under new Dutch GAAP.

Capitalized lease rights are amortized over the term of the lease contracts or over the period of
security of tenure as stipulated by the applicable legal system, also up to a maximum of 20 years.
Software purchased and the related implementing costs and licences are classified as intangible fixed
assets. Software and licences are amortized over three to five years, based on the estimated useful life.

**VICTORIA ACQUISITION III B.V.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (Continued)**

**Tangible fixed assets**

Tangible fixed assets are carried at cost.

Assets brought into use are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life
per category of fixed assets or parts thereof, as follows:

**Maximum estimated**
**economic life**

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 years
Building foundations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100 years
Technical installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
Equipment and shop fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 years
Computer hardware and cash register systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years

Fixed assets with a temporary right of use are depreciated over the terms of those rights. Land is
not depreciated. The lump-sum payments for land leases included in this item are depreciated on a
linear basis over the period for which the land lease has been bought off.

The original acquisition price of fixed assets to which the group holds the beneficiary title pursuant
to a financial lease agreement are taken as being the net present value of the lease installments over
the entire lease period.

Costs of major repairs are charged directly against the result.

**Financial fixed assets**

The non-consolidated participating interests over whose commercial and financial policies VA III
exercises significant control are valued at the proportional share in the net asset value, according to
VA III’s principles for valuation and determination of results.

Participating interests over whose commercial and financial policies no significant control is
exercised and the other non-listed securities are carried at the lower of cost and the expected realisable
value. A detailed list of Vendex KBB’s non-consolidated participating interests can be found at the
Chamber of Commerce.

Receivables from non-consolidated participating interests and other receivables are stated at
nominal value less a provision for doubtful debts where appropriate.

**Impairment of fixed assets**

The book value of fixed assets is assessed for impairments whenever events or changes in
circumstances give cause to do so. For the purposes of such assessments, the assets are divided into
groups based on separately identifiable and largely independent cash flows. The assessments are made
at store level. In the event of impairment, the book value of the assets is written down to their
realisable value.

**Inventories**

Inventories are included at average purchase price, minus a provision for obsolescence,
deterioration and other risks of holding inventories.

**VICTORIA ACQUISITION III B.V.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (Continued)**

**Debtors**

Debtors are shown at nominal value minus a provision for doubtful debts where appropriate.

**Provisions**

In accounting for employee benefits, VA III applies Guideline for Annual Reporting Standards in
The Netherlands 271 (2003). This implies that for defined benefit post-employment benefit plans, the
cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit method. The post-employment
benefit obligation in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for the fair value of scheme assets.

The provision for deferred taxation represents future net tax liabilities due to temporary
differences between the book value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and for tax purposes,
calculated at the standard rate.

Provisions for redundancy schemes and staff who have taken early retirement are valued at the
nominal amounts. Provisions for disability benefits for employees are based on the nominal value of the
expected payment commitments in connection with the actual disability of the present and former
employees.

**Long-term liabilities**

Liabilities are carried at the nominal value. The net present value of future lease instalments in
connection with loans and financial lease agreements is also included. Repayment commitments on
long-term liabilities that are payable within one year are included under short-term loans.

Costs related to debt issuance are capitalized and amortized as financial expense over the period
of the debt instrument involved or, if applicable, over the combined period of directly related debt
instruments.

**Profit and loss account**

Net turnover comprises the sales value of the sold goods and services at the moment of delivery,
net of VAT and sales discounts. For VA III’s own stores, this figure is based on the delivery to
consumers, for franchisees on the delivery of goods to franchisees on the account and risk of the group,
as well as the franchise fees. For concession holders the figure is the concessionary fee.

The cost of sales comprises that part of the value of the goods sold that is absorbed by costs,
including the costs attributed to the purchasing organisation and the transport and warehousing activity.
Cost of sales is recognized in the period in which the turnover is recognized.

Other revenues and expenses are recognized in the period to which they relate.

The calculation of the taxation takes into account permanent differences between the result for
reporting purposes and the result for tax purposes. Claims for tax relief are taken into account insofar
as it is reasonable to assume that recovery or realisation will be possible. VA III, its Dutch subsidiaries
and its direct parent company comprise a fiscal unity for corporate income tax purposes.

Vendex KBB operates defined benefit plans for qualifying employees in primarily The Netherlands.
Under the plans, the employees are entitled to post-employment benefits for approximately 70% of
final salary or average salary on attainment of a retirement age of (generally) 63.

A preliminary and overall actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of the
defined benefit obligation was made in the first half of 2004 by independent actuaries.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (Continued)**

The present value of the defined benefit obligation under the main pension plan was measured
using the projected unit credit method. The key assumptions used in that valuation were:

—Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.2%
—Expected return on scheme assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.1%
—Expected rate of salary increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.0%
—Future pension increases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.0%

The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Group’s obligations in respect of its
main pension scheme is as follows (in millions):

Present value of defined benefit obligation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,404
–/– Fair value of scheme assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,354

= Liability recognized in balance sheet . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50

The provision for other post-employment benefits includes other pension plans in existence,
pre-pension and similar arrangements including transitionary plans and benefits such as post-retirement
medical insurance contributions.

Other employee benefits include provisions for disability and sick pay and anniversaries.

The provision for deferred taxation mostly concerns differences between the valuations of tangible
fixed assets for commercial purposes and for tax purposes, particularly with regard to property. Upon
acquisition of Vendex KBB the deferred tax liability was increased by A119 million in connection with a
fair value adjustment to its property, and decreased by A62 million in connection with fair value
adjustments to employee benefits and certain assets.

The other provisions include amongst others commitments under loyalty programmes,
commitments stemming from extended guarantee insurance, and provisions for non-market rents.

**10. Financial instruments**

VA III and its group companies use financial instruments as part of the ordinary course of
business, which are presented as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, as well as financial
derivatives.

The financial instruments included in the balance sheet consist almost entirely of financial fixed
assets, trade debtors, other receivables, cash, long-term liabilities and current liabilities. The estimated
market value of these financial instruments is approximately the same as their book value, and is based
on net present value.

In order to limit the impact on results of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates, the
company uses interest rate swaps. These financial derivatives are used to fix the interest rate on
underlying loans. The market value of these financial derivatives represents a liability of approximately
A18 million. These financial derivatives are not included in the balance sheet. No hedging instruments
are used for securities or other receivables.

Financial derivatives for hedging interest rate risks and exchange rate risks on current purchasing
orders are not included in the balance sheet, but at the same time recorded with the hedged
transactions. Cash flows from financial derivatives are recognised as financial income and expenses in
the period up to the maturity of the instruments concerned.

In the case of early repayment of loans, the market value of any redundant hedge is ascertained
and the gains and losses represented by that position are recognised in the profit and loss account for
the year.

The credit risk consists of the loss that would arise if any of the parties to the contract were to be
in default on their contractual obligations. VA III and its group companies are generally not exposed to
any significant credit risk with regard to its individual customers or counterparties. There is also a
credit risk is case a counterparty to a contract involving financial derivatives defaults on its obligations.
This is, however, unlikely given the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which financial
derivatives are contracted.

**11. Group equity**

The composition of shareholders’ equity is as follows:

**August 1, 2004**
**(E in millions)**
Issued and paid-in capital . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0
Paid-in surplus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23
Other shareholder funding . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 947
Other reserves . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0

Balance as of August 1, 2004 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 970

_Issued and paid-in capital and paid-in surplus_

The shares are owned by Victoria Acquisition II B.V. The ultimate parent company is Victoria
Holding Sarl, a company incorporated in Luxemburg.

The issued share capital of VA III amounts to 18,001 ordinary shares with a nominal value of one
Euro each. A contribution in kind against issuance of 1 share generated paid-in surplus to the amount
of A23 million.

_Other shareholder funding_

In July 2004 VA III’s ultimate shareholders contributed in proportion to their shareholding,
through VA III’s direct parent company (Victoria Acquisition II B.V.), funds to VA III amounting to
A947 million. While the underlying agreement does provide for settlement in the distant future and
there are provisions for a yield/return, it is at VA III’s discretion whether to pay for these in cash or in
shares, and to determine the yield/return to its parent if any. In addition, there is no intention to have
these funds settled with the parent company unless, for example, the ultimate shareholders sell (part
of) (their interests in) Vendex KBB or unless other funding arrangements would come into place with
which these funds could be settled. For that reason, these funds are considered an equity instrument.

_Other reserves_

The result of VA III since incorporation (including its operating subsidiaries since acquisition) is
approximately zero.

_Management Participation Plan_

In connection with the acquisition of Vendex KBB, VA III has recently implemented an equity
plan (the ‘‘Management Participation Plan’’ or ‘‘MPP’’) under which approximately 50 top managers of
the Group, including the Board of Management of Vendex KBB, may acquire, through an investment
in non-voting depositary receipts in a special purpose entity, an amount, specified individually based
upon the participant’s role within the management team, of equity and loan interests in a parent of
VA III (the ‘‘Plan Issuer’’) in a mix that includes proportionally more equity and less loan interests
than the investment mix of the current indirect shareholders. In addition, MPP participants have been
given the opportunity to invest amounts in addition to the amount specified above in the same equity/
loan interest mix as the current indirect shareholders.

The interests held pursuant to the Management Participation Plan are subject to transfer
restrictions and to certain call and put options. In particular, the current indirect shareholders may
invoke call option rights on a participant’s interests to the extent that certain time- and performancebased criteria are not met or in the event that the participant ceases to be employed by VA III or one
of its subsidiaries. The performance-based criteria relate to the achievement of certain EBITDA,
operating cash flow and net sales targets and are specified for each participating manager. To the
extent that the time and performance criteria are met and a liquidity event takes place through a sale
of shares of VA III or any direct or indirect holding company thereof or any subsidiary thereof, or the
business unit in which the participant is employed is sold, the participant would have the right to sell,
or become obligated to sell, as the case may be, a pro rata portion of its retained interests under the
Management Participation Plan.

**12. Contingent assets and liabilities**

The Group has commitments under repurchase statements and guarantees, totalling A39 million,
which are not included in the balance sheet. These pertain mainly to franchisees and affiliated
companies. In addition, Vendex KBB has issued guarantees in the sum of A41 million for subsidiaries.

The Group has entered into long-term rental and lease contracts for business premises and other
fixed assets. As at August 1, 2004, the net present value of the future commitments, based on 5%
standard rate of interest, was A1,417 million. Of this amount, A251 million is payable within 1 year,
A709 million between 1 and 5 years and A457 million after 5 years.

A lawsuit is pending relating to the merger between Vendex N.V. and N.V. Royal Bijenkorf Beheer
KBB which was formalized on July 16, 1999. The suit claims annulment of the merger or alternatively a
judgement awarding damages. In an interim judgment, the court ruled that expert advice be sought.
Vendex KBB has instituted appeal proceedings against this judgement. Vendex KBB does not consider
it necessary to form a provision in respect of this lawsuit.

At August 1, 2004 Vendex KBB had issued statements of joint and several liability under
Article 403 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code towards almost all of its Dutch consolidated participating
interests except for the group companies that own the property.

Since VA III is part of a fiscal unity, it is jointly and severally liable for corporate income tax
liabilities of the fiscal unity.
