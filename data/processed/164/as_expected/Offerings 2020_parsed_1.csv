The Issuer is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Maxeda DIY Group and the results of operations and financial position of the Issuer are included in Maxeda DIY Group’s consolidated financial statements. The Issuer is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own and does not have any business operations, material assets (other than the shares it owns in Maxeda DIY) or liabilities (other than the Maxeda DIY Intercompany Loan (as defined herein) and those incurred in connection with its incorporation and the Refinancing (as defined herein)). Consequently, no financial information with respect to the Issuer is included in this offering memorandum.

Unless otherwise indicated herein, the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘‘IFRS’’). This offering memorandum includes: - Maxeda DIY Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019 and February 2, 2020 (the ‘‘Audited Financial Statements’’); and - Maxeda DIY Group’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the six months ended August 2, 2020, with comparative financial information as of and for the six months ended August 4, 2019, prepared in accordance with IAS 34, (Interim Financial _Reporting) (the ‘‘Unaudited Interim Financial Statements’’)._ The Audited Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte Accountants B.V. See ‘‘Independent Auditors’’ for a description of the reports of the independent auditor of Maxeda DIY Group on the Audited Financial Statements. The report by the independent auditor of Maxeda DIY Group accompanying the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended February 2, 2020 is unqualified but contains an emphasis of matter paragraph drawing attention to (i) the uncertain outcome of our management’s plans to address the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is hard to predict and (ii) the potentially negative impact that a prolonged outbreak of COVID-19 could have on our business, financial performance and resulting cash flows. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgments. These standards require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations.’’ The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements have been prepared using the same_ accounting principles and on the same basis as the Audited Financial Statements and contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. We have also included in certain sections of this offering memorandum information presenting our results of operations for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, which has been derived from adding the interim financial information for the six months ended August 2, 2020, to the financial information for the year ended February 2, 2020, and subtracting the interim financial information for the six months ended August 4, 2019. The financial information for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles, and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only.

164_1,Offerings 2020.md,3,STABILIZATION,3.8,Certain Changes in Accounting Standards and Accounting Policies,3.8.1,,"On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. On February 4, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16. We applied IFRS 16 using the vi ----- cumulative catch-up approach, and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of application, while comparative financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019 have not been restated and instead apply IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, which were the equivalent predecessor accounting standard in effect at that time. IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. As of the date of the adoption of IFRS 16, the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our consolidated statement of financial position was the recognition of a e524 million right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liabilities in an amount of e524 million. As of the date of the adoption of IFRS 16, the new asset due to the adoption of IFRS 16 was offset by the corresponding liabilities, and therefore no adjustment was made in the opening balance of retained earnings as of February 4, 2019. As of February 2, 2020, the impact of IFRS 16 on our statement of financial position was the recognition of a e461 million right-of-use asset and a corresponding e513 million of lease liabilities based on a discount rate varying between 1.968% and 6.236%. The discount rate applied reflects the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to purchase an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Our results of operations for the year ended February 2, 2020 include e99 million relating to the depreciation of e78 million of right-of-use assets, e23 million relating to lease interest expenses and e2 million relating to the lease interest income on subleases. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended February 2, 2020 included e87 million of rent costs not incurred as operating expenses as a result of the application of IFRS 16. Due to the adoption of IFRS 16 and the associated accounting policy changes applied, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 2, 2020 are not directly comparable with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Due to our current method of determining our financial year, the duration of our financial year may vary. Maxeda DIY Group’s financial year currently consists of a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31. In 2020, the Sunday nearest to January 31 fell on February 2, 2020, resulting in a financial year comprising 52 weeks which ended on February 2, 2020. In 2019, the Sunday nearest to January 31, 2019 fell on February 3, 2019, resulting in a financial year comprising 53 weeks which ended on February 3, 2019.

We present non-IFRS measures because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

We operate our three brands across three store formats, ‘‘City’’ stores, ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores and ‘‘Big Box’’ stores, through which we target distinct customers and project requirements. Each of our store formats offers a unique focus: City Stores:_** Our ‘‘City’’ stores, consisting of our Brico City and Praxis City sub-brands, in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively, are located in city centers. These stores are generally small in size and focus on providing convenient access to products for routine, small-scale maintenance and repair projects, targeting both first-time and more experienced DIY consumers with basic home repair or improvement needs. Mid Box Stores:_** Our ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores consist of our Brico stores in Belgium and our Praxis stores in the Netherlands. These stores are larger in size and provide a wider range of products for larger maintenance, repair, decoration and renovation projects, targeting both first-time and more experienced DIY consumers undertaking decorative or home improvement projects that might require more resources than our ‘‘City’’ stores can provide. Big Box Stores:_** Our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores consist of our BricoPlanit stores in Belgium and our Praxis Mega and Praxis Mega & Garden stores in the Netherlands. These stores are our largest, and provide our most extensive range of products for a variety of home improvement projects, primarily targeting consumers experienced in DIY projects who are shopping for more-technical products for large DIY projects and for more-expensive decorative items. Our digital distribution channel is growing, with over 40 million online visits and e34 million in online sales, (excluding Click & Collect) or 2% of our revenue, for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We operate our digital distribution channel through two websites, one for our Brico and BricoPlanit brands in Belgium and one for our Praxis brand in the Netherlands, in order to meet customer demand for an omnichannel shopping experience and provide greater and more convenient access to our products. In addition to traditional home delivery services, all of our store brands offer a ‘‘Click & Reserve’’ option, which allows customers to order products that do not require assembly or which the customer decides to assemble themselves online and pick up in-store, and a ‘‘Click & Collect’’ option, which allows customers to order products that require assembly and pick them up in store after they have been assembled by our specialists, each of which we believe increases the likelihood of additional or ancillary purchases by the customer. We have also opened a distribution center exclusively dedicated to our online sales. Through our Brico, BricoPlanit and Praxis digital channels, we also provide the option of Drop Shipment, whereby products are shipped directly from the supplier to the customer’s home. We 2 ----- aim to continue to develop our mobile phone and tablet applications across our store brands, enhancing the way we present our products to users and increasing the channels through which consumers can purchase them. We aim to offer our customers a strong value proposition through a comprehensive product assortment across five product categories: (i) decorating, which includes painting and lighting products, (ii) building, which includes wood, flooring and doors, (iii) tools, electrical and hardware, which includes drills and other tools and instruments, (iv) gardening, which includes garden power tools, outdoors furniture and garden wood products, and (v) installation, sanitary and kitchen, which includes plumbing products, taps and heating instruments. We aim to maximize customer choice through a multi-brand strategy that combines a wide offering of top-level branded products selectively complemented by our private label products. In the year ended February 2, 2020, we derived 74% of our Transactional Sales from third-party branded products and the remaining 26% from our private label products. For the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, we generated Transactional Sales of e1,976 million, revenue of e1,483 million, Adjusted EBITDA of e240 million, Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) of e151 million, and had an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.2% and an Adjusted EBITDA margin (pre-IFRS 16) of 10.2%. Our business performed well during the COVID-19 pandemic and we benefitted from the successful implementation of the first two phases of a three-phase strategic plan that we initiated in 2016, which included initiatives such as the development of our e-commerce platform. Our revenue for the six months ended August 2, 2020, increased by e93 million, or 12%, to e861 million, from e768 million for the six months ended August 4, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Like-for-Like Sales by 15.3% over the period, as a result of increased consumer focus on DIY projects due to increased time spent at home and in their gardens as a result of lockdown measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which our stores in the Netherlands remained open and our stores in Belgium closed for only one month between March and April.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.1,Leader in a growing DIY market with a strong store network,"We are a leading DIY retailer in Belgium and the Netherlands, with strong and stable market positions underpinned by a dense network of 348 stores across multiple retail formats and brands that cater to a diverse range of DIY customers and needs. We have adapted to evolving consumer habits by opening smaller outlets in city centers and by investing in our online presence. We have an extensive footprint of 150 Brico and BricoPlanit stores in Belgium and 195 Praxis stores in the Netherlands and also operate three Brico stores in Luxembourg. According to data compiled by GfK, our Brico and BricoPlanit store brands held a combined market share of approximately 44% of the Belgian DIY Market for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We have a particularly strong presence in selected highly populated regions such as Brussels where, according to a retail marketing agency, Brico and BricoPlanit represented an estimated 90% of market share by Transactional Sales for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We also enjoy a strong position in the Netherlands, where we estimate that we are the second-largest DIY retailer in terms of Transactional Sales, with a total of 195 stores trading under our well-established Praxis brand and a combined market share of 25% of the Dutch DIY Superstores Market for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We have benefitted from our online strategy and omnichannel capabilities, in particular during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our market share in Belgium and the Netherlands is supported by our long-standing presence, extensive market knowledge and strong brand visibility in these markets. We believe that the insight gained from our extensive trading history in Belgium and the Netherlands is a competitive advantage relative to new market entrants, because it positions us to identify prime retail locations and capitalize on local customer preferences.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.2,High degree of diversification providing resilience and stability,"We operate a diversified multi-format, multi-brand and multi-channel retail platform designed to serve the varying needs of DIY customers across Belgium and the Netherlands. Our physical network of 348 stores across Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg comprises stores with three distinct but complementary value propositions tailored to their respective geographic regions and target customers. Our ‘‘City’’ stores are designed for maximum convenience, with small surface areas in high population density locations and a specialized product range focused on immediate maintenance and repair needs. Our ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores are larger in size, with an emphasis on a superior in-store experience and an extensive range of DIY, home decoration and gardening products for small and large projects. Our 3 ----- ‘‘Big Box’’ stores are destination stores offering our widest array of products, including those required for large-scale renovations and decorative projects. The broad product offering across each of our three store formats is complemented by knowledgeable staff and expert advice tailored to the product category and specific customer need. Our complementary store formats, expert in-store advice and tailored product offerings allow us to service the full range of our customers’ DIY requirements, from one-off convenience purchases to large projects. We have also developed a ‘‘Do-It-For-Me’’ platform in Belgium and the Netherlands through which customers can find third-party professionals who can perform their DIY jobs. We allow these professionals to register on our platform and we then let customers pick the specialist they need. We aim to offer our customers a strong value proposition through a comprehensive product assortment across product categories. Our stores stock well-established brands such as Grohe, Gardena, Black & Decker, Akzo, Bosch, Knauf, Flexa and Signify. We also have distribution arrangements in place with certain key suppliers to distribute certain of their branded products exclusively in our stores and online in Belgium and the Netherlands. We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors and to boost our range innovation by also offering our private label products as alternatives or complements to our branded offering in certain product categories such as power tools, hand tools and gardening products. With our private label products, we aim to offer equivalent quality and superior value to comparable branded products at a variety of price points through our ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘better’’ and ‘‘best’’ product ranges. The margins generated on our private label products are on average approximately 23% higher than the margins on the equivalent branded products we sell. For the year ended February 2, 2020 we generated 74% of our Transactional Sales from third-party branded products and 26% of our Transactional Sales from our private label products. This extensive and flexible product offering differentiates us from smaller competitors and allows us to optimize sales of trending DIY products.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.3,Dynamic business model based on a strong and flexible operating platform,"Our store portfolio consists of a mix of 65% directly operated stores and 35% franchisee-operated stores, providing operational flexibility across our different formats with the goal of maximizing our profitability in each market. We selectively open new stores in localities where we are not present and where we have identified demand for our products. Our franchise arrangements enable us to reduce the risk associated with growing our network and expanding into new localities. We seek franchise partners with the relevant expertise, specialized market knowledge and local networks required to rapidly succeed in each market, and we permit our franchisees limited flexibility to tailor a portion of their product offering to specialized local demands. However, we maintain robust, centralized control over our stores, products and messaging, thereby ensuring consistent product offerings and the uniform implementation of display and marketing initiatives across all stores. Through this combination of directly operated stores and franchisee-operated stores, we are able to efficiently leverage our well-known store brands and extend our geographic reach. We have selectively sought to convert franchisee stores to directly operated stores in selected formats during the past three years in line with our store optimization focus, and the percentage of our stores that are directly owned has increased from 53% as of April 30, 2017 to 65% as of August 2, 2020. Our brick-and-mortar stores are complemented by our two websites for the Brico and BricoPlanit brands and the Praxis brands allowing us to reach customers who may prefer to order online and who have difficulties in reaching our stores. Our extensive store network and online product offering is supplied by an efficient, diversified and flexible sourcing model that we believe, combined with the large scale of our operations, helps us to obtain favorable commercial terms with our key suppliers and preserve our margins. In recent years, we have made substantial investments in streamlining our supply chain, including the consolidation of procurement functions for Brico, BricoPlanit and Praxis in an effort to maximize synergies between our brands and leverage their combined scale in negotiations with suppliers. Our vendor management team also benefits from the A.R.E.N.A. Alliance, a procurement partnership with seven other retail groups focused on the sourcing and negotiation of supplies of DIY, garden and home improvement products. As of August 2, 2020, we sourced our products from diversified base of over 700 suppliers located primarily in Belgium, the Netherlands and Asia, compared to 900 as of April 30, 2017. We have developed our own Asian sourcing platform since 2011, which we renamed Surity. Surity negotiates and contracts directly with Asia-based suppliers through an office in Shanghai, China. We have been able to leverage knowledge of local markets through this partnership, which also improved our profitability as direct sourcing results in higher margins. In addition, we have implemented a margin enhancement program 4 ----- with the aim of building longer-term relationships with our key suppliers, reducing costs, optimizing the efficiency of our supplier base, concentrating spend and ensuring the quality and security of the supply for a number of our key products. Our procurement initiatives are supported by our SITI program, a lean inventory policy aiming to structurally decrease stock and improve working capital. We have minimized our inventory footprint, operating a single central warehouse (located between Antwerp and Brussels), which supplies our stores in both Belgium and the Netherlands with most of our products. This central warehouse is complemented by a smaller specialized warehouse in Ninove, Belgium, which supplies our stores with wood and construction products, and two ‘‘flow through’’ dock centers (one in Vianen, the Netherlands and one in Bornem, Belgium), which have helped us to efficiently manage our inventory and reduce our distribution costs. We also have a new distribution center in Roermond, the Netherlands, exclusively dedicated to the delivery of products ordered through our online sales channels, the operation of which we have contracted to a third party. We occupy approximately 100,000 square meters of warehouse space. As of August 2, 2020, approximately 24,000 SKUs are delivered through this dedicated e-commerce distribution center.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.4,Successful strategic initiatives have strengthened our business,"We initiated a three phase strategic improvement plan in 2016 which focused on optimizing our business, and we believe that the successful implementation of the first two phases has enabled us to grow revenue, Like-for-Like Sales and Adjusted EBITDA, has reduced operating expenses and working capital, and helped us to perform well during the COVID-19 crisis. Our ‘‘Back to Simplicity’’ strategy was initiated in 2016 with the aim of optimizing functions and reducing costs across our business, and was completed in 2018. Among other things, our ‘‘Back to Simplicity’’ strategy focused on terminating the Praxis Garden franchise format by closing our three remaining Praxis Garden stores in 2017, simplifying our administrative functions by centralizing our headquarters in Belgium and relocating our Amsterdam headquarters, reducing our fixed cost base by renegotiating rents at many of our Praxis stores and investing in our employees and their ability to increase customer satisfaction including by offering general and specialized DIY knowledge, renegotiating our collective bargaining agreement in Belgium, and reducing our electricity costs through the installation of LED lighting at our stores and offices. We initiated the second phase of our plan, our ‘‘Back to Basics’’ strategy in 2017, with the aim of enhancing our customer value proposition through the creation of a new cohesive store format across our Brico, BricoPlanit and Praxis brands, reinforcing our positioning in key product categories, enhancing efficiency of operations and customer service and building commitment from our employees through employee investment, training and empowerment. We have improved the visual identity of our stores and have sought to optimize our inventory offering by conducting a range review across all formats. We have launched a leadership path for store employees and implemented systems to train our employees to be more familiar with our products. In addition, we conducted reviews our store portfolio across all brands, resulting in the opening of 17 new stores, the relocation of four existing stores and the remodeling of six existing stores. As a result of these initiatives, we operate a profitable portfolio of stores and for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, we had only two stores with negative Adjusted EBITDA in Belgium and one store with negative Adjusted EBITDA in the Netherlands. Other stores that had been loss making in prior periods have either been converted to newly-opened City stores in the Netherlands or closed or sold to franchisees in Belgium. We have also identified specific initiatives for the remaining stores with negative Adjusted EBITDA, such as rent renegotiation, active marketing campaign or store closure. We also successfully phased out our Formido brand in the Netherlands. We converted 40 of our Formido stores into Praxis stores, refurbishing these stores and the products they offer to reflect the Praxis brand image, sold 23 stores, and closed the remaining 11 Formido stores. This initiative strengthened our Praxis brand, and we have maintained our market share in the Netherlands through the conversion process. All of our stores in the Netherlands are now operated under the Praxis brand. After conversion to the Praxis brand, the 30 best-performing converted Formido stores has experienced an average gross margin increase of 25% per store for the year ended February 3, 2019, compared to the year ended January 31, 2018, with the five best-performing converted Formido stores experiencing increases in gross margins of 50% on average. 5 ----- We also successfully completed our e-commerce optimization as part of our ‘‘Back to Basics’’ strategy, and have become the leading DIY omnichannel retailer in Benelux, with a variety of sales and delivery channels and the development of our two new, more flexible and mobile-friendly, websites designed to maximize the accessibility of our products. We have invested in the features and functionality of our branded online channels in an effort to diversify our revenue streams and capture a greater share of the growing DIY e-commerce market in Belgium and the Netherlands. For example, we combined the two websites for our Brico and BricoPlanit brands in Belgium, and we now have one website for our Brico and BricoPlanit brands for the Belgian market and one website for our Praxis brand for the Dutch market. These websites offer online ordering capabilities and detailed information on our products. We have also opened a distribution center exclusively dedicated to the delivery of products ordered through our online sales channels in order to improve the speed and efficiency of our delivery of online orders. The expansion of our digital platform and the integration of online capabilities into our physical stores, such as in-store tablets and Wi-Fi access points in all our stores for the ordering of products unavailable in stores, has also had a positive impact on our profitability, as it is less costly to fulfill orders that are picked up in our stores through our Click & Collect and Click & Reserve services than orders that are delivered directly to our customers. We also focus on community interaction, and distribute inspirational DIY videos explaining DIY techniques to our customers and potential customers in order to increase brand loyalty and showcase products available in our stores. We have also increased our social media coverage to enable interaction with customers and improve after sale communications.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our strengths,9.2.5,Resilience demonstrated through the COVID-19 outbreak,"Our business performed well during the COVID-19 outbreak, in part due to consumer focus on DIY projects while in lockdown or working from home. Even though governments in Belgium and the Netherlands implemented measures to contain the spread of the virus and these measures affected our business operations, along with those of other retailers in the markets in which we operate, the growth of Belgian and Dutch DIY markets significantly accelerated since the beginning of 2020. This was partly due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which resulted in strong customer focus on home improvements and DIY projects, especially small home repairs. This trend accelerated when governments eased lockdown measures in June 2020, with customers in Belgium resuming DIY projects that they were unable to 6 ----- complete due to the closure of stores in Belgium, as illustrated in the following graphs (according to GfK): 10SEP202018085811 While we initially experienced a substantial decrease in sales in Belgium due to store closures, our stores subsequently experienced sales growth in late April, May and June, and sales in those months were higher than for the comparative months in 2019, primarily due to increased DIY activity as a result of our customers spending more time at home and in their gardens. Our stores in the Netherlands remained open throughout the pandemic, with limited opening hours, and performed well, and our sales in the Netherlands for the period from March to June were higher than for the comparable period in 2019, as customers increasingly focused on DIY home improvements, which we presume resulted from increased time spent at home as well as adapting the home space for additional functions including school and work. We incurred e9 million in costs incurred for additional health and safety measures in our stores during the six months ended August 2, 2020. We believe that the improvements implemented as part of our strategic initiatives, allowed us to take advantage of this trend and contributed to our business’ strong performance during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, most of the Formido stores that we converted to Praxis are small stores that consumers favored during the pandemic outbreak, which confirmed our strategy to focus on a diversified multi-format platform. We also benefitted from our e-commerce optimization strategy over the last three years and the investments in our product range availability, as online shopping and delivery increased during the outbreak. Our online sales (excluding Click & Collect) in Belgium increased by 350% for the six months ended August, 2, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, and online sales (excluding Click & Collect) also significantly increased in the Netherlands, with an increase of 23% for the six months ended August, 2, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. We believe that the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent government measures have contributed to an increased consumer focus on home and garden improvements, and we believe this will be a long-term trend with a positive impact our operations. 7 10SEP202018085811 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strategy,9.3.1,Continuing to improve our operating performance through effective cost management and working capital optimization,"We plan to continue to reduce costs and optimize our use of working capital in order to maintain and enhance our cost position and improve our operating performance and profitability, in line with the ‘‘Back to Simplicity’’ and ‘‘Back to Basics’’ phases of our strategic improvement plan. Our ‘‘Make-it-Easy’’ strategy also aims to, among other things, further improve our cost savings and optimize 8 ----- our use of working capital. Cost-saving initiatives include the installation of self-scanning desks for self-checkout at our stores, synergies in our Brico and BricoPlanit marketing costs, increasing the sourcing of our private-label products and reduced storage times between the offloading of incoming supplies and their onwards reshipment. We continuously seek to improve our cost base which in turn allows us to offer compelling pricing to our customers, including through partnerships such as the A.R.E.N.A. Alliance to negotiate better terms with suppliers. We also intend to reduce the cost of our utilities and reevaluate certain of our maintenance and repair contracts. We also aim to improve our working capital requirements. Our working capital optimization initiatives include further strengthening relationships with certain preferred suppliers and the rollout of our SITI program, which will enhance our inventory management by, for example, allowing us to return to certain relationship suppliers of certain products that we have not sold at the end of a promotion campaign. We also encourage members of certain teams and committees to meet specific cost reduction and productivity improvement targets each year, with a material amount of their compensation tied to their performance against these targets. We require that capital projects meet certain return thresholds, which encourages prudent levels of spending on expansion and cost-saving opportunities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strategy,9.3.2,Reinforce our positioning in each of our product categories with a comprehensive product offering at compelling prices,"We aim to further strengthen our position by continuing to perform full reviews and optimizations of our product range to better tailor our offering to customer demands. We perform these reviews periodically for each product category to identify, stock and market products which we believe have high growth potential or reflect consumer trends. We then prioritize the visibility of these product categories in our stores and on our website. For example, we aim to increase our standing as a specialist in certain key product categories, such as ‘‘non-mobile’’ products and tools for larger home improvement and installation projects, by showcasing these products in our stores more often. We also intend to further increase the product density in our ‘‘City’’ stores by reducing the width of store aisles to increase SKUs carried and showcase more of our product offering. In our ‘‘Mid Box’’ and ‘‘City’’ stores, in which due to store size our product range is necessarily more limited compared to our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores, we have scaled our product range more appropriately to customer demand, offering a strategic selection of SKUs per product category in order to efficiently service customer demand while managing our inventory levels. Furthermore, we have used and intend to continue to use a range of targeted promotions to highlight our capabilities as a multi-specialist retailer and comprehensive DIY solutions provider. Our upcoming promotion initiatives include sale days on which we provide certain discounts across all product categories, as well as promotional events targeting specific seasonal or product categories, particularly in our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores. For instance, ‘‘wood month’’ will promote our capabilities as a wood products specialist, and ‘‘gardening days’’ will showcase for customers our comprehensive and compelling range of outdoor products.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strategy,9.3.3,Enhancing our operational efficiency and customer service by leveraging our digital platform,"As part of our ‘‘Make-it-Easy’’ strategy, we intend to (i) leverage our e-commerce activities to move into markets where we are currently not present by expanding the reach of our websites internationally to commercialize our private label and exclusive brands in these markets, such as in France, (ii) invest in high quality content to increase search engine optimization and search engine advertising, (iii) continue to increase the amount of SKUs available on our online stores, (iv) launch a product locator app, and (v) increase the amount of orders that can be fulfilled through either Drop Shipment or through our dedicated e-commerce distribution platform. All our product ranges are available on our digital platform and we have further expanded the availability of SKUs on our websites through the development of our Drop Shipment Model, through which certain suppliers deliver products directly to the consumer’s home. We are working on making all SKUs that are available in-store available online, and are also expanding our catalogue of online products to include product categories that are not available in-store. As a result, the number of SKUs on each of our store brand websites may grow to substantially exceed the number of SKUs in the corresponding brand’s physical stores. The number of SKUs available on our online stores grew from approximately 35,000 as of January 31, 2018, to approximately 60,000 as of August 2, 2020. We view our digital platform as an extension of our stores. We believe that our opportunities to expand our 9 ----- e-commerce sales are greater in areas where we have brick-and-mortar stores, as e-commerce sales are positively impacted by the convenience of our Click & Collect option. We believe that expanding the number of SKUs available on our store brand websites will be an important competitive advantage because this will increase the accessibility of our product offering and further develop our strategic growth initiatives for our multi-channel platform.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strategy,9.3.4,"Improving Like-for-Like Sales through employee investment, training and empowerment","Our team members drive our success. As part of our ‘‘Back to Basics’’ strategy, we built commitment through employee investment, training and empowerment including through the launch of a leadership program for store employees and of a training academy for administrative employees, the implementation of an e-learning platform for our employees and the establishment of a new digital human resources management platform. As part of our strategic growth initiatives under our ‘‘Make-it-Easy’’ strategy, we will continue to invest in our workforce and partners with training and individual empowerment, including through (i) the rolling out of a company-wide onboarding program, (ii) the simplification of internal tools such as a digital platform to manage human-resources matters and an internal social network, (iii) increased role-diversification and (iv) the rewarding of internal talents. In addition, we believe that our customers place significant value on technical knowledge and service, and that one of our key advantages is our ability to provide expert advice to our customers across all product categories. Due to our wide range of products, and the highly technical nature of many DIY products, customers increasingly rely on well-trained sales associates to offer knowledgeable assistance in product selection and use. To serve this need, our employees participate in continuous training through our ‘‘Maxeda Academy’’ program, including formal workshops, seminars and certification programs to build technical, managerial and customer service skills. We are also investing in our information technology to introduce online training courses on DIY knowledge for our employees, and we are working with our product suppliers to increase the amount of hands-on training provided to our employees with respect to new products. In addition, we have customer service measurement systems and recognition programs in place for management, sales associates and other employees to measure and encourage overall customer satisfaction. By having more knowledgeable employees, we believe we can offer better customer service and, accordingly, increase our sales.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strategy,9.3.5,Refining our three store formats and brands to enhance customer value propositions and accessibility,"We seek to continuously improve the customer experience in our stores by adapting to the changing preferences of our target customers and their project requirements. We intend to continue to refurbish stores on a rolling basis to increase revenue and attract new customers through spatial optimization and user-friendly new store layouts. For instance, to strengthen the Praxis brand, we are seeking to improve the customer value propositions by adjusting prices of our products and product ranges at our Praxis City ‘‘City’’ stores and standard Praxis ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores to attract more customers into these stores, which we believe will result in increased sales density and improved profitability, bringing Praxis’s profitability in line with our Brico stores. As of August 2, 2020, we opened 15 stores that apply the new Praxis format, of which four are in Belgium and eleven are in the Netherlands, and refurbished 18 of our stores to reflect this new format, of which nine are in Belgium and nine are in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we plan to continue opening new stores in areas where we do not currently operate. Our ‘‘Make-it-Easy’’ strategy includes certain initiatives through which we intend to continue to refine our store formats to enhance customer value and increase accessibility. Such initiatives include the expansion of our BricoPlanit network to approximately 20 stores from 13 stores. We seek to improve our market-leading positions in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands by selectively expanding into new local regions and opening additional directly operated stores and franchisee-operated stores that meet our rigorous selection criteria and that will allow us to cover areas that we do not currently serve through brick-and-mortar stores. Furthermore, we aim to increase the accessibility of our stores through selective strategic relocations and facility improvements tailored to the needs of our customers and trends in our markets. For example, we intend to relocate certain stores to better retail locations along highly traveled roads benefiting from higher footfall or visibility. We also anticipate that we will extend the Sunday trading hours at certain of our Belgian stores, to the extent permitted by law, because we believe the weekend allows our customers the greatest opportunity to visit our stores and make 10 ----- in-person purchases.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, subject to certain conditions, in the event of acceleration of the Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes, amounts recovered in respect of the Notes, including from the enforcement of the Guarantees or the Collateral, will be required to repay indebtedness in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement to rank _pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility and future hedging_ obligations (if any) in priority to the Notes, following the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Trustee and the Security Agent (and any receiver or delegate) and any fees and expenses of any other creditor representative of future indebtedness permitted under the terms of the Indenture to benefit from such security interests. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the relevant security unless instructed by the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). The relevant Instructing Group or such other class of creditors as specified by the Intercreditor Agreement may, under certain conditions, be entitled to instruct the Security Agent to enforce the relevant security subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of conflicting instructions, the Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions as to which set of instructions will prevail. See ‘‘Description of _Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’_ Additional Amounts . . . . . . . . . . . .** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of taxes unless required by law. If the Issuer or the Guarantors are required by law to withhold or deduct amounts for or on account of tax imposed by a relevant taxing jurisdiction with respect to a payment to the holders of Notes, the Issuer or the relevant 17 ----- Guarantor will, subject to certain exceptions, pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of the withholding or deduction. See ‘‘Description of _the Notes—Withholding Taxes.’’_ Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We intend to use the proceeds of the Offering together with cash on hand at the Issuer to (i) fund the Existing Notes Redemption; and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ Optional Redemption . . . . . . . . . .** Prior to, 2022, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus the applicable ‘‘make whole’’ premium described in this offering memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after, 2022, the Issuer will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth under the heading ‘‘Description of _the Notes—Optional Redemption’’ plus accrued and unpaid_ interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to, 2022, the Issuer will be entitled at its option on one or more occasions to redeem the Notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount outstanding in respect of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date, so long as at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately after each such redemption and each such redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing date of the relevant equity offering. Prior to, 2022 the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) for informational purposes only. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the items for which an adjustment is made occurred at the dates indicated. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment as nonrecurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. These amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent audit firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations for the periods presented, may not be comparable with our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information 25 ----- included in this offering memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Data.’’ We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as our results for the period as adjusted for certain items we believe are non-cash or nonrecurring. We define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16)’’ as Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude the impact of IFRS 16.

The consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended February 3, 2019 included in the offering memorandum is extracted from comparative financial information in our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 2, 2020, instead of the consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 included in our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019. For a detailed description of the basis of presentation with respect to our historical financial information see ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data.’’ The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 (Interim Financial Reporting). The consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum for Maxeda DIY Group and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and have been presented in euro. Our historical results for any prior period are not necessarily indicative of our results expected in any future period. On February 4, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16. We applied IFRS 16 using the cumulative catch-up approach, and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of application, while comparative financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019 have not been restated and instead apply IAS 17 and IFRIC 4, which were the equivalent predecessor accounting standard in effect at that time. We have also included in certain sections of this offering memorandum information presenting our results of operations for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, which has been derived from adding the interim financial information for the six months ended August 2, 2020, to the financial information for the year ended February 2, 2020, and subtracting the interim financial information for the six months ended August 4, 2019. The financial information for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles, and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not necessarily representative of our results for any future period or our financial condition at any past or future date. Certain other data, including as adjusted data included herein, are for information purposes only, and do not purport to present what our results of operations and financial condition would have been, nor do they project our results of operations for any future period or financial condition at any future date.

We face significant competition from local, regional, national and international DIY retailers, as well as from privately owned single-site retailers. Currently, our major competitors are Hubo, Gamma, Mr. Bricolage, Karwei, Hornbach and Bauhaus. In recent years, competition has increased as general retailers such as department stores, electronics stores, garden centers, supermarkets, discount retailers, mail order retailers and internet retailers have entered or expanded their presence in the DIY market. Competition in the DIY retail sector is primarily based on price, product mix, quality and services offered to customers. Competition will likely increase as a result of the use of e-commerce and the internet as distribution channels by existing and new competitors, who may be able to provide lower prices, greater choice and/or superior convenience through their e-commerce sales channels. Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online and compare prices and products. Furthermore, some of our competitors, both DIY retailers and general retailers, are larger than us, or are divisions or subsidiaries of larger corporations, and are more established or have greater financial or other resources than we do, which may put them in an advantageous position when negotiating contracts with major suppliers or acquiring retail real estate, and may enable them to devote greater resources to advertising and marketing campaigns. We also face competition from other European operators of large superstores, some of which may expand into Belgium and the Netherlands, or have recently expanded into the Netherlands, such as Bauhaus, either through organic growth or by acquiring smaller DIY retailers with an existing market share in Belgium and the Netherlands. Large competitors could use economies of scale to their advantage, and may be able to, among other things, purchase inventory and/or sell products at lower prices, make substantial marketing expenditures or offer a superior in-store experience compared to our stores. We may not be able to effectively compete with these retailers, which could threaten our market position in the markets in which we operate, and negatively affect our levels of sales and profit margins. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage will require continued investment in modernizing or replacing our stores, sourcing and developing new products, maintaining and developing our digital capability and our logistics network, including our suppliers, distribution channels, sales and marketing, and customer relationships. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our market and our business,13.1.2,"We may not be able to accurately predict and address customer preferences, demand and demographics.","We have assembled our product offering across our multiple retail formats and have built a multimodal customer delivery platform that attempts to provide our customers with an extensive range of DIY products that address their needs. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in product technological developments, local population demographics and consumer preferences, expectations and needs, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict 28 ----- the products and services our customers will demand. In addition, we must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy varying consumer preferences and demographics. Our competitors, including online competitors, may stock a greater number of SKUs than our stores, or may offer a more compelling product mix. We also must be able to train our in-store personnel to understand new products, some of which are technologically complex, and sell those products to our customers. We may not be able to accurately predict customer preferences or demand for certain products, and some of our products may be rendered obsolete because of developments in technology. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing trends or misjudge the market or consumer demand and demographics, our revenue will decline and we may have a substantial amount of unsold inventory, a portion of which may be perishable goods, or miss sales opportunities. In response, we may be forced to rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory. We may spend substantial sums developing products with our suppliers, or we may enter into minimum purchase contracts with suppliers for goods, which may exacerbate losses if those products are not successful. In contrast, in the event that certain products are more successful than anticipated, we may need to restock initial inventories at one or more of our locations. Despite our robust supply chain, we may not be able to replenish a particular store that has reduced stock and we may therefore end up with insufficient inventory at particular locations. Such an inventory shortage might result in unfilled orders and lost revenues. Any failure to adequately address consumer preferences and properly maintain inventory levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Customer expectations about the methods they use to purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are demanding convenient options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick and low-cost delivery. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchase and delivery process. Failure to provide a compelling online presence or to adapt our product delivery model to shifting market expectations, especially in comparison to our competitors, may result in lost sales opportunities and adversely affect our results. Customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company, products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. Furthermore, we have a store base that requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates. If we cannot maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively, timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs, differentiate the customer experience for our main customer groups or effectively implement a comprehensive and compelling merchandising assortment, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share, could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our market and our business,13.1.3,"We are affected by general economic conditions, including the condition of the housing markets, in our regions.","Our results of operations are affected by the prevailing economic climate, including GDP growth, unemployment levels, salaries (including minimum wages), the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence, demographic developments and consumer perception of economic conditions. These factors affect all markets in which we operate, although to different degrees. Consumers may spend less money on DIY products during economic downturns or in periods of low economic growth, as they seek to increase savings and postpone cost-intensive improvement projects. The effects may be more pronounced during extended periods of economic downturn or low economic growth. Consequently, during periods of economic downturn or low economic growth, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have recorded, and may continue to record, lower sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Although we have established a diverse supplier base and try, where feasible, to maintain alternative sources for our products, global economic conditions and uncertainties may impact our suppliers, particularly if they are forced to close manufacturing plants that supply important products to us, or if the cost of raw materials increases. Suppliers would normally seek to pass increased raw materials costs through to us, and may be able to do so depending on our contractual relationship with them and our ability to obtain alternative supply. Any increase in the prices at which we purchase our inventory could 29 ----- adversely affect the margins on the products we sell, and we may not be able to raise our retail prices due to competition or other factors. In addition to general economic conditions, the condition of local housing markets particularly affects consumer demand for the products we sell. The DIY retail sector is dependent on the general propensity of consumers to build, renovate and improve homes, since the majority of our DIY products are used for home improvement, refurbishment and renovation. In stable or strong housing markets, sales of DIY products benefit from housing moves and renovations undertaken by consumers. However, in a weaker housing market, factors such as tighter restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing, slower household formation growth rates, lower existing home sales and falling home prices may limit consumers’ discretionary spending. Consumers thus would be less likely to move houses or undertake renovations on existing properties, which could result in a decreased demand for DIY products. The COVID-19 pandemic may result in prolonged adverse developments in the housing markets in Belgium and the Netherlands. Weak housing markets in these countries may result in a decrease in the sales of our DIY products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our market and our business,13.1.4,Our business depends on a strong brand image and reputation.,"We believe that the brand image we have developed has contributed significantly to the success of our business to date. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is integral to the success of our business and to the implementation of our business plans. Our maintenance, promotion and positioning of our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, and our ability to provide good customer experiences. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if negative publicity tarnishes our public image or reputation. Our brand image may be diminished if we fail to maintain high standards for, among other things, the timely and efficient delivery of quality products and an after-sales service, if we fail to maintain high social and environmental standards for all our operations and activities, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations or if we experience other negative events that affect our image or reputation. Moreover, other factors that we may be unable to control, such as any safety issues with our products due to the fault of the supplier and any resulting product liability claims against us, could tarnish our reputation. The widespread use of social media by consumers to disseminate negative retail experiences could exacerbate these reputational risks. Any failure to maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The brand names of our private label products represent an important asset of our business. Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with these brand names is central to our success. Certain of our policies, including our pricing policies and our expansion policies, could damage our reputation and the value associated with our brand names and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of our products and services, our reputation may be diminished, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of qualified and competent employees while at the same time controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the automatic indexation of wages in Belgium, and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage or healthcare benefits. An inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our employees in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly as the economy continues to improve and the labor market tightens. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain suitable employees in the future. A shortage of suitable employees could detrimentally impact our in-store customer service and may consequently result in reputational harm and adversely affect our results. Finally, measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the requirement to wear 30 ----- face-masks on store floors and social distancing requirements, may negatively impact our employee relations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

We will seek to realize significant cost savings in procurement, central office functions, inventory management and information technology through certain cost-saving programs described in ‘‘Summary—Our Strategy.’’ In order to realize these cost savings, we expect to incur material expenditures, which may be higher than our estimated amount. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement our cost-saving measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Furthermore, our ability to achieve the planned cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to achieve these anticipated cost savings in a timely manner, if at all. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these projects proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated time frame, the expected benefits from our cost-saving measures. Furthermore, pricing pressure from our customers or competitors or other variables may deprive us of some of the anticipated long-term benefits from the cost-saving measures that we currently expect to realize. Our new business initiatives could result in unintended consequences, such as the loss of customers and key suppliers, a reduction in administrative or operational capabilities, or collective action by our workers. Our inability to realize the anticipated cost savings from our operational efficiency strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our market and our business,13.1.7,Our franchise ownership structure exposes us to a number of risks.,"As of August 2, 2020, 121 of our 348 stores were operated on a franchise basis in Belgium (77 of our 150 Belgian stores) and the Netherlands (44 of our 195 Dutch stores). As of August 2, 2020, our franchisee-operated stores were owned and operated by an aggregate of 86 franchisees, with the largest franchisee operating six stores. Historically, franchisees enabled us to rapidly add significant scale at a low investment rate. Although we believe that franchisee-operated stores are beneficial to us because the capital required to grow and maintain our store portfolio is partially funded by franchisees, it also presents a number of drawbacks, such as our limited influence over franchisees and our reliance on franchisees to implement major initiatives, our limited ability to facilitate changes in store ownership and limitations on our enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Our operating results in part depend upon our franchisees’ sales volumes and financial viability. However, we cannot control many factors that impact the profitability of franchisees’ stores because our franchisees are independent operators. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements. In addition, franchisees may not hire and train the most qualified managers and other store personnel. Our franchisees may also experience financial difficulties that impair the quality of their customer offerings and force them to close their stores or enter into insolvency proceedings. For a limited number of our franchisees, we have granted guarantees in favor of their local financing banks for the purchase of stock and inventory. As of February 2, 2020, the aggregate amount of franchisee obligations for which we have granted such guarantees amounted to e17 million. If our franchisees experience financial difficulties, they may be unable to pay their debts and cause us to buy back their inventory and stock. For example, we have taken certain franchisee-operated Brico stores in Belgium as compensation for certain franchisees’ inability to pay debts. While we can ultimately take action to terminate franchisees that do not comply with the standards contained in our franchise agreements, we may not be able to identify problems and take action quickly enough and, as a result, our image and reputation may suffer and our results of operations could decline. In certain cases, for instance when we wish to maintain long-term control over a particularly attractive retail location, we enter into a head lease of a property and sublet such property to a franchisee to the extent necessary for our franchisees to secure suitable premises. In these circumstances we are exposed to the risk that the tenants under those subleases fail to comply with their obligations under those subleases, including obligations to pay the rent required. As of August 2, 2020, we sublet 39 stores 31 ----- to our Brico franchisees and six stores to our Praxis franchisees. To the extent a significant number of these franchisees default on their obligations under our subleases, we would be required to continue to fulfill the obligations under the head lease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our efforts to build alignment with franchisees may result in a delay in the implementation of our marketing and advertising programs and other key initiatives such as store refurbishments. The failure of our franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Some of our principal competitors may have greater influence over their stores than we do. As a result, our competitors may have a greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies, including their marketing and advertising programs. In addition, we may be involved in disputes with our franchisees. We generally seek to resolve any disagreements with our franchisees amicably. Formal dispute resolution occurs through arbitration, if provided under the applicable franchise agreement, or through litigation. Moreover, franchisees operate some of our most profitable stores. Should a dispute arise with one of these franchisees, we may lose significant franchisee revenue or suffer damage to our reputation if these stores must close as a result of arbitration or litigation proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation, the effect of any adverse judgment of a court or arbitrator against us or the amount of any settlement that we may be forced to enter into with any third-party. Even if we were successful in defending such proceedings, we would still suffer from the distraction of management resources to such proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly face harm to our reputation from case-related publicity. The involvement in litigation and arbitration proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our net assets, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew such permits and licenses in a timely manner, or that the permits and licenses that we have applied for will be obtained. In addition, we cannot assume that we will obtain such permits and licenses in a timely manner for the opening of new stores. If we are unable to renew or obtain such permits and licenses, we may not be able to open or operate a store, or we may be subject to certain penalties which vary from the imposition of fines to the termination of our business in the respective properties, as the case may be. Such penalties, especially the termination of our activities in the properties in which we operate our stores, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our market and our business,13.1.9,Our business is subject to the risks and costs associated with our predominantly leasehold property portfolio.,"We lease all but one of our properties, which are located throughout Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and accordingly we are subject to price increases, periodic rent reviews and renegotiations in the rental property markets in which we operate. Our current leases expire at various times. Our Dutch leases had an average remaining lease term of four years as of August 2, 2020. Furthermore, as of August 2, 2020, 72% of our Dutch stores had leases that expire within the next five years. Our Belgian leases had an average remaining lease term of nine years as of August 2, 2020. As of August 2, 2020, the current term of the head leases of 39% of our Belgian stores expire within the next 5 years. Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates, to maintain our lease agreements or to renew any expired or terminated lease on commercially favorable terms, or at all, will depend on many factors that are not within our control, such as, among other things, conditions in the local real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and prospective landlords. If we are unable to renew our leases, we may not be able to lease a suitable replacement location on commercially favorable terms, or at all. In addition, there may be regulatory and/or legal restrictions in order to lease a property or open a new store in certain locations. In Belgium, as of August 2, 2020, 36 of our stores for which we have entered into head leases were with one commercial landlord, Redevco. The current terms for the leases of eleven of these stores will expire within the next five years, but four of these eleven leases have two remaining renewal terms of nine years each and six of these leases have three remaining renewal terms of nine years each. We may be adversely affected if we experience any difficulty negotiating new leases or renewing leases on commercially favorable terms with Redevco. In addition, our ability to continue to operate stores leased from Redevco may be adversely affected if Redevco experiences financial difficulty or seeks to terminate its relationship with us. 32 ----- From time to time we may be unable to terminate leases prior to their scheduled expiration without incurring a significant fee or financial penalty. As a result, we may not be able to terminate leases at our option, and in such circumstances, we may be unable to cease operating an unprofitable store which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. If we seek to modernize or refurbish our stores, we may need consents from landlords or local authorities. If any such works are carried out, or have been carried out previously, without consent, disputes may arise that may result in our having to undertake reinstatement works or the landlord seeking the termination of the relevant lease. At the end of a lease we may face dilapidation claims from landlords which (whether founded or unfounded) may require us to make unforeseen payments to landlords and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our operations are subject to price increases from various utility providers, and increases in local taxes and assessments, in the areas in which we operate. We also from time to time guarantee the lease obligations of certain of our subsidiaries. Any unanticipated or sharp increases in our rental payments, utilities, taxes or assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

We rely on four distribution centers, a central distribution center which serves our store network across Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, two flow through centers, one in Belgium and the other in the Netherlands, for the storage and distribution of our products, and a further distribution center in the Netherlands, the operation of which we have contracted to a third party, for the delivery of products ordered through our online sales channels. Because we rely on only four facilities for the storage and distribution of our products, any major breakdown, disturbance or accident which affects any of these facilities would have a material impact on the operation of our supply chain, which would adversely impact our ability to distribute products to our stores in a timely manner. In addition, any contractual dispute with the owners of our flow through centers could disrupt our use of those facilities and impact our ability to supply our products to our stores. Thus, any significant disturbance, whether owing to a natural catastrophe or a contractual dispute with third parties, could affect our in-store inventory and our ability to meet our customers’ requirements. Furthermore, because we source a portion of our products from Asia and other parts of Europe outside Belgium and the Netherlands where we operate our stores, our logistics providers may encounter issues associated with international shipping that could affect their ability to deliver our products on time or at all. For instance, there may be delays or cancellations in the shipments of our products as a result of, but not limited to, natural catastrophes, geopolitical issues, labor disruptions or any unforeseen failures in the operations of our third-party partners. Any delay in our shipments of products could affect our ability to offer our full product range. The COVID-19 pandemic may result in lockdowns in countries where our suppliers operate and may impact their operations, which may in turn result in delays in deliveries or the cancellation thereof. Failures in our supply chain, such as those mentioned above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

In general, our revenue is the highest during April through July and lowest during the winter months of December through February. For example, we generated 41% of our revenue for the year ended February 2, 2020, in the period from April 1, 2019 to August 4, 2019. Significant periods of unfavorable weather conditions, extreme weather conditions, such as drought in the summer months, heavy snowfall, floods or unseasonal conditions may result in unsold inventory, especially of seasonal merchandise, which is difficult to clear without relying on 33 ----- markdowns or promotional sales. In addition, significant cash requirements during the periods of the year when our cash on hand is low could result in us not being able to meet our obligations.

Our stores’ websites are an important sales channel for our products. We therefore must continue to make our websites attractive for our customers, easy to use, efficient for the purchase of our products and free of performance issues. Our ability to continue to develop our online sales depends on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully market our websites, the hiring, training and retention of qualified personnel, our ability to integrate our growing online operations on a profitable basis, the capability of our existing distribution center to accommodate our growing online operations, the effect of any competition our online operations may have with our existing stores, increased competition from other retailers as they introduce or enhance their own transactional websites or expand their existing online functionalities and product offering, and consumers’ changing preferences with respect to how they shop online, for example, through mobile and tablet applications. Since many other DIY and general retailers are enhancing their own digital platforms, we will likely incur significant capital expenditure to maintain and develop our own platform to stay competitive. If we fail to operate a successful digital platform, we could lose business to our competitors. A loss of market share to our competitors as a result of our inability to grow our digital platform and the incurrence of significant capital expenditure related thereto could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, growing our online platform will result in increased reliance on information technology, the interruption or failure of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, we must continually anticipate and adapt to the increasing use of social media and mobile devices by our customers in the purchasing process. We must ensure that our websites remain compatible with mobile devices and operate without performance issues on newer devices in order to maintain and further develop our reputation as a reliable online vendor. To the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. These platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade secret information or compromise other valuable company assets, any of which could harm our business. Additionally, performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyber-attacks, including phishing and social engineering attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of us as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services. As a result of such attacks, our systems may fall under the control of attackers and may be used for purposes including the launch of further attacks against other systems that we control or against systems of others, including through the use of our e-mail addresses and confidential information to launch phishing and social engineering attacks. The costs of maintaining and enhancing our customer-facing technology systems have increased in recent years in line with an increase in customer demand for e-commerce services. Future costs associated with further expanding our e-commerce platform could be substantial.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Any significant disruption to the operations of our IT systems could significantly affect our ability to carry out retail transactions in-store and online. Any resulting loss in sales from a critical failure of our IT systems thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 34 ----- We anticipate that, in line with our expansion and optimization of our existing operations, we will from time to time be required to upgrade our IT systems, which will entail significant investments. The introduction of new software or upgrades requires not only considerable investment but also skilled personnel, and may not be successful or may take longer than initially anticipated. If we are not able to implement such new systems, if required, in a timely and cost effective manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected. In addition, a considerable proportion of our IT systems is hosted externally (including cloud services) by third-party service providers.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading COVID-19 was a global pandemic. In response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments around the world implemented a variety of measures to reduce the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions and bans, social distancing required for both individuals and businesses, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders and required closures of non-essential businesses. These measures have significantly reduced commercial and consumer activity on a global basis. It is unclear if and when the pandemic will cease and whether previously lifted measures will need to be reinstated. Governments may in the future reimpose measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including lockdown measures, either nationwide or locally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Furthermore, the disruptions triggered by COVID-19 in countries where our suppliers are located may also result in a slow-down of their production activities and other disruptions, any of which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Even as lockdown and other measures are eased, the outlook for the world economy following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic remains subject to unprecedented uncertainty and such uncertainty may be prolonged. The International Monetary Fund predicts negative global growth in 2020 and many national governments have instituted rescue policies intended to prevent a financial recession. A renewed or future recession could lead to an adverse impact on demand for our products and on our results of operations. Adverse market conditions outside of Europe could impact global economic conditions which could have an adverse economic impact on Europe, including Belgium and the Netherlands. If the business interruptions caused by COVID-19 last longer than we expect, we may need to seek other sources of liquidity, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms or in an amount sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any deterioration in financial markets could impair our ability to obtain financing in the future, including our ability to incur additional indebtedness to continue our ongoing operations, fund liquidity needs or refinance the Notes. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the length of time it takes for demand to stabilize and normal economic and operating conditions to resume. For example, the report by our independent auditors accompanying our Audited Financial Statements for the year ended February 2, 2020 contains an emphasis of matter paragraph drawing attention to (i) the uncertain outcome of our management’s plans to address the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the actual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is hard to predict and (ii) the potentially negative impact that a prolonged outbreak of COVID-19 could have on our business, financial performance and resulting cash flows. In the event that lockdown measures and/or resulting market instability continue or resume, they could adversely impact our ability to accurately plan and forecast and/or our ability to continue to operate as a going concern. In addition, government authorities have made an inquiry into why certain of our employees were kept in technical unemployment under special COVID-19 employment legislation, pursuant to which the government paid a part of their salaries directly, after our stores re-opened. If any of our employees are deemed to have been unduly placed in 35 ----- technical unemployment under the special legislation, we may be required to pay back the portion of the salaries paid by the government and/or incur a penalty charge. As a result of the above or any future outbreak of another virus or other contagious disease, and any mitigating measures taken in response and/or any resulting economic downturn or recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks discussed in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Our ability to expand depends on our ability to continue to secure suitable locations on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to secure high quality real estate on terms and rates acceptable to us. If our competitors are able to secure such sites, they may be able to increase their market share in these areas and consequently restrict our ability to expand. Additionally, we may experience difficulties securing new retail space due to regulatory measures, such as approvals from regional or local planning authorities. Although we prepare investments in new locations on the basis of detailed market research analyses which examine, among other criteria, catchment area, purchasing power, potential demand and competition, we may still face the risk of unsatisfactory sales performance in new locations. Our market research analysis may prove to be inadequate, particularly due to factors that are difficult to predict, such as customer behavior, or the data available may prove to be insufficient, such as in periods when market conditions are changing. We cannot guarantee that investments in new locations will yield the anticipated returns. Investments in unsuitable locations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. The successful execution of our expansion strategy also depends on our ability to integrate new operations into our existing business, including our distribution network, and achieve economies of scale. The success of our selective expansion strategy will depend upon our ability to open and operate new stores and renovate and refurbish existing stores on a timely and cost effective basis, while continuing to increase sales at other existing stores. We cannot assure you that the opening of new stores will exclude the possibility of the diverting of sales from our existing stores, thereby reducing sales in those stores. The growth and refurbishment of our store network could place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources. Any failure, or delay, in responding to these challenges or in implementing our expansion strategy in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, our expansion strategy is capital intensive. New store openings involve significant capital expenditure. In the future, we may be unable to arrange financing for our expansion plans on favorable terms, if at all.

In addition, we rely on and will increasingly rely on other forms of media advertising to market our products to potential and existing customers. For example, we maintain Facebook, Twitter and YouTube accounts. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations on the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business or subject us to fines or other penalties. Changes in laws and regulations also may adversely impact our ability to reach our customers with advertisement materials. For example, certain regions in the Netherlands have recently implemented laws that prohibit unaddressed printed advertisements from being delivered to recipients who have not expressly opted-into receiving unaddressed printed advertisements. Such regulations may materially impact our ability to reach our current and prospective 36 ----- customers with printed advertisements. Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and marketing programs.

In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties infringing our intellectual property rights. We may not always be successful in securing protection for or stopping infringements of our intellectual property rights.

Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers and producers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. We believe that there are a limited number of reliable, high quality third-party suppliers in the industry who are prepared to provide a sufficient volume and quantity of products, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative agreements or arrangements in the future with third-party suppliers, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. This could limit our ability to maintain our quality standards and meet customer demand for our products. If our existing suppliers were unable or unwilling to continue to supply our needs, or if they were to be willing to do so only at higher prices or on commercially unfavorable terms, our ability to provide materials, products and services to our customers at competitive prices will be adversely affected. For example, our ability to obtain an adequate volume and quality of wood, particularly hard-to-find species of wood, depends on our suppliers’ ability to furnish such wood, which, in turn, could be affected by, among other things, forest fires, insect infestation, tree diseases, prolonged drought, other adverse weather and climate conditions, and government regulations relating to forest management practices, each of which may threaten our suppliers’ ability to perform their contractual obligations to us. Since we may be unable to procure such materials and products elsewhere at short 37 ----- notice, we may experience supply delays, and we may be forced to revise the terms, including the price, on which we supply products to our customers, which could prompt our customers to purchase those products from our competitors. As part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market a variety of third-party branded products. We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market certain of their branded products exclusively in our stores, although these products do not form part of our private label portfolio. If we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable branded products, we may not be able to effectively differentiate our product offerings, which may impact our revenue and gross margin results. For example, we have entered into an agreement with one of our Asian suppliers, Positec, pursuant to which we have the exclusive right in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to sell Positec’s hand held power tools under three of its brands (Worx, Xceed and Rockwell) in our stores and online. If our contract with Positec is terminated or if we otherwise do not meet certain of our contractual obligations, Positec can terminate our right to exclusively sell these branded products. Some of our contracts with our suppliers contain best efforts undertakings to meet minimum purchase levels. While we aim to meet these requirements, there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances, such as a sudden change in consumer preferences or natural disasters, will not make it difficult to do so. Any disputes with our suppliers regarding these minimum spending requirements may result in litigation or other action and such disputes could lead to long-term harm to our relationship with the supplier, affecting our ability to offer the supplier’s products in the future. If a supplier fails to meet our manufacturing specification or volume requirements in those arrangements, we may terminate our agreement with such supplier.

We transport products between our warehouses, distribution centers and stores and deliver certain of our products to our customers. Transportation costs have historically fluctuated significantly over time, particularly as a result of fluctuating oil prices, and increases could result in reduced profits. We also depend on third parties for transporting certain of our products to our distribution centers and to our customers through our Drop Shipment Model and our Store Home Delivery Model, and these services are subject to price changes and could be disrupted. We are sometimes required to source products internationally, and therefore we may be subject to higher transport costs and may face a greater threat of damage to our products during shipping, either of which may have a negative impact on our inventory costs and working capital. In addition, pursuant to our expansion strategy, we intend to open additional stores, which may increase our exposure to logistics costs and risks.

For credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees. These fees may increase over time, which would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. We can also be subject to fraud and other crimes related to the unauthorized use of credit and debit card information by our clients, including through our stores’ digital channels, which could harm our reputation and subject us to expensive and time-consuming litigation. Any failure to comply with applicable requirements or regulations may subject us to fines and higher transaction fees, the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or the cessation of payments from credit and debit card providers to us for purchases already made. We may also experience disruptions or other difficulties with credit card providers or electronic payment systems, which may cause difficulties for us and our customers. Our customers could lose confidence in certain payment methods, which may result in a shift to new payment methods or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, many of the DIY products sold in our stores, particularly in our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores, require substantial expenditure on the part of consumers. Products such as heavy home appliances (‘‘white goods’’), bathroom fixtures, bulk construction materials and certain decorative finishes can be expensive and, unlike certain of our competitors, we do not offer consumer credit services or installment payment plans to help consumers finance these large purchases. By not providing such financing options, we avoid the need to administer consumer accounts and collections, and are exempt from various regulations governing the provision of consumer credit; however, our lack of alternative financing options could result in certain customers cancelling or postponing large purchases, or purchasing from a competitor that offers such financing alternatives, which could affect our results.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

There can be no assurance that continued or expanded efforts to counteract this trend will be effective or that the cost of such efforts will not increase. Moreover, as part of our day-to-day operations, we manage a significant amount of cash at the cash registers in our stores, which increases our risk of experiencing shop crime and fraud that could lead to a decrease in our cash levels in-store. The failure to control and reduce shop crime and fraud in a cost-effective manner could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Accordingly, the purchase price of our products may not be denominated in euro, which is the currency in which we generate our revenues. Approximately 10% of our imports are in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, a portion of the currencies in which we purchase supplies are pegged to the U.S. dollar. If the value of the currency in which the purchase price of our products is denominated increases relative to the euro, the profit margin for any such transaction would be reduced. Although we engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to reduce our foreign currency exposure, our hedging strategies may not adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, and will reduce any benefit that we might otherwise have received from favorable movements in exchange rates.

We try to counter this risk by flexibly adjusting our investments, maintaining a sufficient liquidity cushion and with short- and medium-term financing based on existing credit lines. If we become obligated to immediately repay any funds drawn due to a default under any financing documentation, we would be required to obtain refinancing, which may only be available on stricter terms and conditions. If any of the aforementioned risks materializes, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our working capital may be influenced by accelerated payments terms imposed by law. For example, since May 1, 2020, a law in Belgium requires all large Belgian companies to pay small Belgian companies within a 60-day term on average. Since we qualify as a large Belgian company and many of our suppliers qualify as small Belgian companies, our payment terms with small Belgian suppliers are expected to accelerate, which we expect will have an adverse effect on our working capital. In addition, trade credit from our suppliers is an important source of financing for the purchase of the inventory we sell in our stores. Accordingly, the loss of, or a reduction in, trade credit could have a significant adverse impact on our inventory levels and operating cash flow and negatively impact our liquidity. This change, or if a further change in regulation were to cause an additional reduction in payment terms, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our suppliers may seek credit insurance to protect against the nonpayment of amounts due to them. If credit insurance is not available to suppliers at reasonable terms or at all, suppliers may demand accelerated payment of amounts due to them or require advance payments or letters of credit before goods are shipped to us. A negative change in our credit ratings or our suppliers’ perception of our creditworthiness, including due to pending debt maturities, may impact their willingness to provide trade credit to us. Any adverse changes in our trade credit for these or other reasons could increase our costs of financing our inventory or negatively impact our ability to deliver products to our customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. While the risk of defaulted receivables is considerably reduced due to our retail format of cash-and-carry and is generally limited to the carrying amounts of the financial assets, we are generally exposed to risks of financial losses in connection with financial investments and derivative financial instruments. We endeavor to limit these credit risks by working exclusively with contractual partners of strong credit worthiness and selecting banks covered by collective deposit security arrangements, but we cannot exclude the possibility that one or more of our contractual parties may be unable to comply in part or in full with the obligations entered into under financial instruments.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on an ongoing basis. As of the expected Issue Date, after giving effect to the Refinancing, we would have had e889 million of outstanding indebtedness, comprising the Notes and e489 million of lease liabilities. In addition, we expect our Revolving Credit Facility to be undrawn as of the Issue Date. The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. We experience significant fluctuations in our monthly and intra-month working capital. Fluctuations in our monthly working capital are driven by payments to our trade creditors that tend to be higher in the months following our peak seasons to pay for stock purchases made during such peak seasons. In addition, our intra-month working capital varies significantly due to regularly scheduled payments on certain days of each month to our trade creditors as well as to our employees and landlords. As a result, we may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of our working capital requirements following the Issue Date. Drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility will vary and may be substantially higher during certain months and weeks to compensate for our seasonally reduced cash reserves. For a discussion of our working capital see ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations—Adjusted net working capital.’’_ Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. Any debt that we incur at a non-Guarantor subsidiary level would be structurally senior to the Notes. Any debt that benefits from ‘‘super priority’’ liens (including the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Indenture) would receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. Additionally, we could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the 46 ----- Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. The Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will restrict, among other things, our ability to: - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions, with respect to the shares of the Issuer; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries; - issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into unrelated businesses or engage in prohibited activities; - consolidate or merge with other entities; - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and - amend certain documents. All these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See ‘‘Description of _the Notes—Certain Covenants.’’ The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance_ our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to comply with a financial test under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet that financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of this test could result in a restriction on the ability to make new drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, but would not result in a default or an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated revenue growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will mature six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’_ The commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants included in the Indenture. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’ At the maturity of the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the ‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which benchmark rates are determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt or derivative linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). In the event that LIBOR is discontinued or otherwise declared to be unrepresentative, it is likely that the parties to any such debt or derivative will need to agree an alternative benchmark and we cannot say at this time what that benchmark may be or how it will be calculated or administered. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported benchmark rates, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest (including under the Revolving Credit Facility) and on the hedging of our debt obligations. In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (‘‘SONIA’’) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit sterling LIBOR rates beyond 2021. In the US, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in cooperation with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering transitioning away from U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (‘‘SOFR’’). These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks, to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. 49 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

We may increase the amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facilities or incur additional Super Senior Liabilities permitted under the Indenture, as a result of which the amount that will benefit from ‘‘super priority’’ first-priority security interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions. The fair market value of the Collateral may be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral.

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or 51 ----- winding-up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside bankruptcy, the actio pauliana provisions. The actio pauliana provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third-party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside the bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet) in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a Dutch court found that the issuance of the Notes or the Guarantees (as applicable) and the granting by the Issuer or the Dutch Guarantors (as applicable) of the Collateral involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under Dutch law, then the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the Guarantees (as applicable) and the granting of the Collateral could be nullified. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes or the Guarantees (as applicable) may not enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Guarantees (as applicable) or the Collateral, and the value of any consideration that holders of the Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the other creditors of the Issuer and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest.

Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such non-guarantor companies before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such company; and - the creditors of such non-guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

The Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium and the Netherlands. Any insolvency proceedings by or against us or any of the Guarantors will likely be based on the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant entity and not of the United States. In the event we or any Guarantor experience financial difficulty, no prediction can be made as to which jurisdiction’s or jurisdictions’ insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or as to the outcome of such proceedings. Any enforcement of the Guarantees after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of incorporation or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of the rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, the priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdictions laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the Netherlands and such other jurisdictions. Proceedings could also be initiated in Belgium, the Netherlands, or other countries to enforce your rights against Collateral located there. Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. 55 ----- In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of the rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceedings.

However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. The same limitations may apply to security interests (other than the Guarantees) that will be provided by the Guarantors in certain jurisdictions. Enforcement of any of the Guarantees or security against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee or other security depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor; or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantees has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture or other securities pursuant to the Security Documents. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was ‘‘insolvent’’ at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. 56 ----- The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution, or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. It is possible that the entire Guarantee or other security may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. The payment of dividends to the Issuer will reduce the distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents. We are under no obligation to maintain a specific level of distributable profits and reserves, and, if we have distributable profits and reserves, we may make dividend payments or payments of principal and interest on the intercompany loan that reduce our distributable profits and reserves to zero. We intend to make dividends and enter into intercompany loans to service indebtedness and for tax planning purposes. There can be no assurance that we will have distributable profits and reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees and Security Documents, whether or not we distribute dividends or enter into intercompany loans. The payment of dividends to service our debt obligations (including under the Notes) will deplete the distributable reserves available to satisfy the obligations under the Guarantees. In addition, the payment under the Guarantees and the enforcement of security interests under the relevant Security Documents may require certain prior corporate formalities to be completed, including, but not limited to, obtaining an audit report, shareholders’ resolutions and board resolutions.

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. If we repay a portion of the Notes in an amount over 40% of the principal amount of the Notes in aggregate, we are required under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to reduce the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility proportionately in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control were to occur at a time when our group is prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that our group would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes 57 ----- would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of Control.’’ The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘Change of Control’’ as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under ‘‘Description of _the Notes—Change of Control,’’ the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to_ offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case holders of Notes would not be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of control repurchase price. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Change of _Control’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event.’’_ The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

In addition, all members of our board and our officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts in any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon United States laws. See ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of _Civil Liabilities.’’_ There is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands or Belgium for the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. This may give rise to difficulties in respect of the enforcement in the Netherlands or Belgium of judgments obtained in the United States. _The Netherlands_ A final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the United States federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court. Under current practice however, a Dutch court will generally grant the same judgment without a review of the merits of the underlying claim if (i) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (ii) that judgment does not contravene public policy of the Netherlands (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iii) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, nor with an earlier judgment 59 ----- rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is, according to the law of its country of origin, final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body. Based on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that United States investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors or officers who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in United States courts in civil and commercial matters. In addition, there is doubt as to whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors or our officers in an original action predicated solely upon the United States laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively. See ‘‘Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities’’ for further information. _Belgium_ As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex _fori). In Belgium the procedural rules contained in, among others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the_ Code of Private International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by United States courts is sought in Belgium. As such, and in accordance with such procedural rules, a final and enforceable judgment of the courts exercising jurisdiction in the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Belgium without review on the merits provided that certain conditions are complied with. Accordingly: (i) the claimant will have to produce documentary evidence that a final decision has been obtained, that due process has been observed in obtaining such judgment, and that the final decision has been notified to the defendant and is enforceable under the applicable law; and (ii) the recognition and enforcement will be refused in specifically circumscribed situations including instances where the recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment would be a manifest violation of public policy, where the foreign courts have not respected the rights of defense, where the foreign judgment is not final or where the assumption of jurisdiction by the foreign court has breached certain principles of Belgian law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

For instance, we increased our focus on growing our online offering and our customer delivery options in response to changing consumer shopping patterns and behaviors. We also expect that consumers will increasingly rely on online sales and delivery as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific factors affecting consumer spending on our products and Like-for-Like Sales growth include our ability to maintain and improve our attractive product mix and pricing (including through enhancing our sales and marketing strategies), the location and overall aesthetic appeal of our stores, the accessibility and integration of our in-store and digital channels, our ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing consumer preferences, our ability to respond to existing and future competition and our ability to provide superior customer service. In order to attract more customers to our stores, we invest in training our employees to enable them to address a multitude of requests from our customers and to specialize in certain product lines in accordance with consumer preferences. From time to time we also hire employees specialized in particular fields of the DIY industry to address customer demands that are specific to certain stores. Training employees and hiring specialists both require significant investment and may have an impact on our margins if our revenues do not increase proportionally to our investment.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting results of operations,17.2.2,"Distribution channels, product mix and product pricing","_Distribution channels_ Our results of operations are impacted by the successful integration of our multiple distribution channels. Through our multi-format business, we can provide our customers with a wide range of style, 65 ----- quality and value shopping options, we can adapt the size, layout, promotional efforts and product offerings of our stores to target distinct demographics and DIY needs and we can grow in existing markets and penetrate new markets. Our various brands generate different sales per square foot and margins, as they sell different products in different size formats. As a result, consumer preferences for one brand over another will affect our results. Our ‘‘City’’ and ‘‘Mid Box’’ formats combined accounted for 65% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, primarily due to the large number of ‘‘City’’ and ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores we operate (305 stores as of August 2, 2020), as compared to our BricoPlanit and Praxis ‘‘Big Box’’ stores (43 stores as of August 2, 2020). While our ‘‘Big Box’’ format accounted for 35% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, our BricoPlanit stores generate higher sales per store than our other store brands, primarily due to BricoPlanit’s focus on DIY customers who are undertaking larger and more expensive projects. We continue to develop our significant e-commerce presence. Our opportunities to expand our e-commerce sales are greater in areas where we have brick-and-mortar stores, as e-commerce sales are positively impacted by the convenience of our Click & Collect option. We have invested in our digital platform, developing websites with online ordering capabilities for all of our three store brands. All our product ranges are available on our digital platform and we have further expanded the availability of SKUs on our websites through the development of our Drop Shipment Model, through which certain suppliers deliver products directly to the consumer’s home. In addition, we offer a Click & Collect service, whereby consumers can order and purchase products online and collect them in-store, and our Store Home Delivery Model, through which customers can order products on our website which are then delivered directly from the store to the customer at their preferred shipping address. The expansion of our digital platform and the integration of online capabilities into our physical stores has had a positive impact on our revenue as it is less costly to fulfill orders that are picked up in our stores than orders that are delivered directly to our customers. Our investment into a mobile application has also allowed us to continue to adapt to changing consumer preferences and drive consumer spending on our products. Our ability to continue to grow our e-commerce presence will impact our results. Our e-commerce operations have experienced an increase in visitors and orders following the COVID-19 outbreak given the decrease in footfall in our stores and an increase in customer preference for purchasing products online. We believe this will be a long-term trend impacting our business and we intend to develop our digital channel accordingly. Our proportion of revenues generated by our e-commerce operations as compared to our total revenues has historically been higher in the Netherlands, although this gap has diminished for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020 due to increased online sales in Belgium at a rate higher than in the Netherlands in March and April 2020, when our stores were closed in Belgium due to lockdown measures. For the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, our online sales (excluding Click & Collect) accounted for 2% of our revenue.

Even though governments in Belgium and the Netherlands implemented measures to contain the spread of the virus and these measures affected our business operations, along with those of other retailers in the markets in which we operate, the growth of Belgian and Dutch DIY markets significantly accelerated since the beginning of 2020. This was partly due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which resulted in strong customer focus on home improvements and DIY projects, especially small home repairs. This trend accelerated when governments eased lockdown measures in June 2020, with customers in Belgium resuming DIY projects that they were unable to complete due to the closure of stores in Belgium. While we initially experienced a substantial decrease in sales in Belgium due to store closures, we subsequently experienced sales growth in our stores in late April, May and June, and sales in those months were higher than for the comparative months in 2019, primarily due to increased DIY activity as a result of our customers spending more time at home and in their gardens. Our stores in the Netherlands remained open throughout the pandemic, with limited opening hours, and performed well, and our sales in the Netherlands increased from March to June compared to the comparable period in 2019, as customers increasingly focused on DIY home improvements, which we believe resulted from increased time spent at home as well as adapting the home space for additional functions including school and work. Increased demand and, to a lesser extent, disruption in our supply chain reduced our inventory, which was e322 million as of August 2, 2020, compared with e325 million as of August 4, 2019. We 67 ----- incurred e9 million in costs for additional health and safety measures in our stores during the six months ended August 2, 2020. Our online sales (excluding Click & Collect) in Belgium increased by 350% for the six months ended August, 2, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, and online sales (excluding Click & Collect) also significantly increased in the Netherlands, with an increase of 23% for the six months ended August, 2, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. We believe that, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent government measures, consumers increasingly focus on home and garden improvements and will be a long-term trend with a positive impact our operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores, which all operate under our BricoPlanit brand, offer larger products and more-extensive product ranges targeted at DIY consumers undertaking larger DIY projects, while our ‘‘City’’ stores, which operate under our Brico and Praxis brands, offer a smaller selection of convenience products in more-confined markets. Our ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores, which operate under our Brico and Praxis brands, provide an intermediate range of products for everyday needs. Our larger products generally generate higher transactional values, and thus a shift towards larger and more advanced products in any period would positively impact our sales and profitability. We regularly perform product range reviews and tailor product offerings in our stores to their respective target demographics in order to be able to offer an appropriate product mix for the specific customers of each distinct store brand. _Product pricing_ The price of our products has a direct impact on our revenue and is dependent on general economic conditions and pricing pressure from our competitors in the markets in which we operate, especially in the Netherlands. If pricing competition increases, we may sell fewer products than expected or we may need to sell these at lower prices. Certain of our competitors have in the past launched large-scale discount campaigns which have intensified price competition in the DIY sector. We have responded to this pressure by selectively reducing some of our own prices and by increasing our focus on higher-margin products. We have successfully reduced prices while maintaining margins by improving operational efficiencies through the implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and by leveraging economies of scale. However, sustained or intensified pricing pressure from brick-and-mortar and online competitors could erode our profitability margins and market share. For the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, 15% of our revenue in Belgium and 28% of our revenue in the Netherlands was derived from products that were advertised in our promotional leaflets and sold at promotional prices. On average, we offer in these leaflets a 30% discount on our Praxis products, an 11% discount on our Brico products and a 15% discount on our BricoPlanit products. Moreover, approximately 1% of the products we sell in Belgium and 4% of the products we sell in the Netherlands are perishable goods (mainly plants). As part of our efforts to rationalize our product ranges, we seek to increase our inventory turnover rates by clearing out-of-date products and other slow-moving items at marked down prices shortly after they become obsolete, which is typically the result of changing seasons or the introduction of newer products. This reduces the margins we realize on our products even if our revenue has increased or remained stable over the same period.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

General economic factors affecting consumer spending include the prevailing economic climate, levels of employment, salaries 68 ----- (including minimum wages), the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of economic conditions. The health of the housing markets in Belgium and the Netherlands also affects our business, as sales of home improvement products and other household goods benefit from strong housing sales. Consumer purchases of nonessential items (including those required for large projects, such as updating kitchens and bathrooms) can decline in an unfavorable economic environment, especially when disposable income and consumer confidence decrease. However, trends in the renovation and improvement of existing homes can also substantially impact our results even in a weaker housing market, because homeowners may invest in home improvements when they postpone new home purchases. A comparatively high rate of home ownership in Belgium and a focus on largerscale projects to improve home comfort are reflected in higher sales of ‘‘non-mobile’’ products, with the ‘‘Big Box’’ store format particularly popular in this market, contributing to higher sales densities and resulting margins. By contrast, the Dutch DIY market is primarily driven by trends in the housing market (i.e., home sales and new builds), and by smaller-scale maintenance, repair and decoration projects such as painting and flooring. As such, smaller store formats are more popular in the Netherlands and comprise a higher relative share of sales compared to the Belgian market. In addition, we believe that as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent government measures, consumers increasingly focus on home and garden improvements. We believe that DIY retail has become an essential business for consumers and that this will be a long-term trend impacting our operations. Smaller stores have also proven to be more accessible to our customers during lockdown measures imposed by governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. An economic downturn or a prolonged decrease in consumer spending in our markets could lead to an increase in consumer demand for discounted products with lower selling prices, which may force us to accept sales with lower margins. The Dutch DIY market is more competitive than the Belgian DIY market, a factor which may also contribute to pricing pressure and lower margins in the Netherlands. The Dutch DIY market reflects rising consumer confidence levels on the back of the growing housing market in the Netherlands, and stands to benefit from supportive macroeconomic indicators, such as positive GDP growth and lower unemployment levels.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Our major competitors are primarily other national and international DIY retailers, such as Hubo, Gamma and Mr. Bricolage in Belgium and Gamma, Karwei, Hornbach and Bauhaus in the Netherlands. In recent years, competition has increased as general retailers such as department stores, electronics stores, garden centers, supermarkets, discount retailers and internet retailers have entered or expanded their presence in the DIY market. Competition from other retailers affects our ability to attract customers and may cause pricing pressure, requiring us to increase capital expenditures to upgrade stores or increase costs as we seek to provide more competitive products and services. In order to enhance our marketing strategy, increase customer loyalty and improve the in-store experience of our customers, we have also implemented several tactical promotional initiatives, such as loyalty cards, in both Belgium and the Netherlands. We have invested in staff training programs focused on optimizing time management and improving customer service. We also intend to continue to undertake periodic reviews of our product range to ensure that we tailor the products we offer across all our retail channels to meet consumer demands and effectively compete in the market. We have historically been successful in maintaining our market shares in our primary markets and continue to be successful in doing so. In the Netherlands, our market share has declined to 25% of the Dutch DIY Superstores Market for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, from 31% for the year ended January 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to our reduction in store count over the same period, in turn primarily due to our phasing out of the Formido brand. However, as the competitive dynamic in our markets continues to evolve, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in protecting or growing our market share in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Among other things, our ‘‘Back to Simplicity’’ strategy focused on terminating the Praxis Garden franchise format by closing our three remaining Praxis Garden stores in 2017 and closing or relocating unprofitable stores (including two Praxis and four Brico stores), simplifying our administrative functions by centralizing our headquarters in Belgium and relocating our Amsterdam headquarters, reducing our fixed cost base by renegotiating rents at many of our Praxis stores, terminating a television sponsorship agreement and investing in our employees and their ability to increase customer satisfaction including by offering general and specialized DIY knowledge, renegotiating our collective bargaining agreement in Belgium, and reducing our electricity costs through the installation of LED lighting at our stores and offices. We initiated the second phase of our plan, our ‘‘Back to Basics’’ strategy in 2017, with the aim of enhancing our customer value proposition through the creation of a new cohesive store format across our Brico, BricoPlanit and Praxis brands, reinforcing our positioning in key product categories, enhancing efficiency of operations and customer service and building commitment from our employees through employee investment, training and empowerment. Across our brands, we have improved the visual identity of our stores and have sought to optimize our inventory offering by conducting a range review across all formats. We have launched a leadership path for store employees at both our directly owned and franchisee-owned stores and implemented systems to train store personnel to be more familiar with our products. In addition, we conducted reviews our store portfolio across all brands, resulting in the opening of 17 new stores, the relocation of four existing stores and the remodeling of 6 existing stores. As a result of these initiatives, we operate a profitable portfolio of stores and for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, we had only two stores with negative Adjusted EBITDA in Belgium and one store with negative Adjusted EBITDA in the Netherlands. Other stores that had been loss making in prior periods have either been converted to newly-opened City stores in the Netherlands or closed or sold to franchisees in Belgium. We have also identified specific initiatives for the remaining stores with negative Adjusted EBITDA, such as rent renegotiation, active marketing campaign or store closure. We launched the third phase of our plan, our ‘‘Make-it-Easy’’ strategy, in 2019 and we expect to complete it by 2023. Our ‘‘Make-it-Easy’’ strategy aims to grow our revenue by pursuing the optimization of our store network, further enhancing our customer value proposition with a permanent review of our product range, further developing our digital channel through online sales growth and customer data collection, increasing ‘‘at home’’ services with initiatives such as our ‘‘Do it for me’’ option and continuing to hire and develop new talent through training. We also successfully completed our e-commerce optimization as part of our ‘‘Back to Basics’’ strategy, and have become the leading DIY omnichannel retailer in the Benelux, with a variety of sales and delivery channels and the development of our two new, more flexible and mobile-friendly, websites designed to maximize the accessibility of our products. We have invested in the features and functionality of our branded online channels in an effort to diversify our revenue streams and capture a greater share of the growing DIY e-commerce market in Belgium and the Netherlands. We have also opened a distribution center exclusively dedicated to the delivery of products ordered through our online sales channels in order to improve the speed and efficiency of our delivery of online orders. We also focus on community interaction, and distribute inspirational DIY videos explaining DIY techniques to our customers and potential customers in order to increase brand loyalty and showcase products available in our stores.

In Belgium, the rental costs of our directly operated stores are subject to annual indexation in accordance with the development of the health index. Our policy has been to cap these price indexing provisions where possible, although this does not preclude the likelihood of moderate rent increases in Belgium in 2020 in line with the expected moderate inflation for the year. In addition, the salary paid to our employees in Belgium undergoes automatic inflation in accordance with the applicable health index and is also adjusted as a result of the outcome of negotiations with labor unions on new collective labor agreements. We estimate that the impact of indexation increases in Belgium under our labor agreements was 2% for the year ended February 2, 2020, compared to the year ended February 3, 2019. In the Netherlands, we estimate that the impact of indexation increases under our labor agreements was 2% for the year ended February 2, 2020, compared to the year ended February 3, 2019. Although we seek to offset the impact of indexations on labor and rent through our cost-saving initiatives, labor and rental costs are key cost components that can escalate our operational expenses and decrease our cash flow in a given year. 70 ----- Inflation can also affect levels of employment, disposable income, consumer confidence and consumer willingness to spend. High inflation rates can negatively affect each of these factors, which can then reduce consumer demand for our products and customer traffic in our stores and on our digital platform, and lead to the loss of sales. Inflation is also a risk to our business and financial condition because, in many cases, our expenses are not recorded at one time but instead, for example, over the life of a particular supply contract or franchise or lease agreement. Accordingly, a greater than expected increase in inflation related to the cost of leases and other property costs, labor costs and merchandise costs can result in higher levels of expenditure than initially estimated at the time the expenses were initially agreed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

While our policy is to hedge against the commitments recorded in our ordering system and to use forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognized financial liabilities, unfavorable currency exchange rates on payments under our U.S. dollar-denominated supplier contracts can nevertheless have a significant impact on our financial condition. For example, we estimate that 11% of our purchased goods for the year ended February 2, 2020, were sourced from Asia. We purchased a portion of these goods sourced from Asia in U.S. dollars through forward contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, we are subject to certain shifts in currency valuations, such as the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar and vice versa.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Our most important trading period in terms of revenue, operating results and cash flow has historically been the spring and early summer, with 41% of our revenue in the year ended February 2, 2020 generated from April 1, 2019 to August 4, 2019, when we experience a significant increase in sales of outdoor and gardening products, among other things. Our inventory is typically highest in the first quarter of our financial year, and we incur additional expenses in advance of the spring and early summer seasons in anticipation of higher sales during that period, including increased inventory and advertising as well as the hiring of additional employees. By contrast, our lowest sales volume occurs during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Past trends indicate that, in addition to the spring and early summer seasons, peaks in revenue also occur as a result of promotional events and seasonal sales. Our results are also affected by periods of abnormal, severe or unseasonable weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably warm or cold weather could affect demand for certain of our seasonal products, such as heating products used during winter or outdoor/gardening products that are more popular in warmer months, thereby resulting in large quantities of unsold inventory or the need to heavily discount certain products. Adverse weather conditions arising early in a particular season could have a more pronounced impact on our profitability, leading to a slowdown in sales recorded at full margin followed by more extensive markdowns at the end of the season. In addition, our liquidity position as of August 2, 2020, benefitted from the government initiatives implemented in Belgium and in the Netherlands to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as tax and/or social charge deferrals. Our liquidity position as of August 2, 2020, does not reflect (i) a payment of e26 million of value added tax due for the six month ended August 2, 2020, in the Netherlands, which we paid on August 3, 2020, (ii) a payment of e13 million of value added tax in the Netherlands that we paid on September 4, 2020, in accordance with the Dutch government measures to defer the payment of certain taxes following the COVID-19 outbreak, and (iii) e11 million of social charges in Belgium for March, April, May and June 2020, which we intend to pay in December 2020 in accordance with the Belgian government measures to defer the payment of certain social charges following the COVID-19 outbreak. We also had constructive discussions with certain of our suppliers to obtain payment term extensions during the COVID-19 outbreak, which had a positive impact on our working capital and liquidity. As a result of these various measures, our liquidity position as of August 2, 2020, is not directly comparable with our liquidity position as of February 2, 2020, and August 4, 2019. 71 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

164_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.16,Key factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations,17.16.1,Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting policies,"On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on November 9, 2017. On February 4, 2019, we adopted IFRS 16. We applied IFRS 16 using the cumulative catch-up approach, and the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 was recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of application, while comparative financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019 have not been restated and instead apply IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 which were the equivalent predecessor accounting standard in effect at that time. IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. As of the date of the adoption of IFRS 16, the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our consolidated statement of financial position was the recognition of a e524 million right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liabilities in an amount of e524 million. As of the date of the adoption of IFRS 16, the new asset due to the adoption of IFRS 16 was offset by the corresponding liabilities, and therefore no adjustment was made in the opening balance of retained earnings as of February 4, 2019. As of February 2, 2020, the impact of IFRS 16 on our statement of financial position was the recognition of a e461 million right-of-use asset and a corresponding e513 million of lease liabilities based on a discount rate varying between 1.968% and 6.236%. The discount rate applied reflects the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to purchase an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Our result of operations for the year ended February 2, 2020 include e99 million relating to the depreciation of e78 million of right-of-use assets, e23 million relating to lease interest expenses and e2 million relating to the lease interest income on subleases. Our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended February 2, 2020 included e87 million of rent costs not incurred as operating expenses as a result of the application of IFRS 16. Due to the adoption of IFRS 16 and the associated accounting policy changes applied, our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 2, 2020 are not directly comparable with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

164_1,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.34,Liquidity and capital resources,17.34.2,,"Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Our cash needs relate primarily to capital and other expenditures for opening new stores, maintaining and refurbishing existing stores, meeting debt service requirements and funding our working capital requirements. The components of our working capital are inventory, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, excluding short-term loans from credit institutions, and provisions. We believe that, based on our current cash flows, these sources of liquidity, together with existing available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditure and debt service for at least the next twelve months. We are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of the Issue Date, after giving effect to the Refinancing, we expect to have e889 million of indebtedness, comprising primarily of the Notes and lease liabilities. We will also be able to borrow up to e65 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility is dependent upon certain conditions described further under ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.’’ The Indenture governing the Notes offered hereby will contain, and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains, restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future opportunities and capital needs, or pursue business opportunities and activities. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility also requires us to comply with a leverage ratio, under certain circumstances, in order for us to continue to be able to draw funds under this facility. We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which in turn depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the other factors discussed in ‘‘—Key _factors affecting results of operations’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors.’’ Trade credit from our suppliers is also an_ important source of financing for the purchase of the inventory we sell in our stores. Accordingly, the loss of, or reduction in, trade credit can have a significant adverse impact on our inventory levels and operating cash flow and can negatively impact our liquidity. Our suppliers may seek credit insurance to protect against nonpayment of amounts due to them.

Our cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended August 2, 2020 amounted to an inflow of e248 million, primarily due to operating results of e91 million and an increase in cash flow from working capital of e139 million, primarily attributable to an increase in cash flow from trade and other payables of e167 million primarily due to higher trade creditors due to increased buying volumes as a result of increased sales volumes, an increase in other taxes and social security contributions of e40 million of which e24 million were deferred to the third and fourth financial quarters, and an increase in cash flow from inventories of e3 million due to the implementation of our SITI program partially offset by a decrease in cash flow from trade and other receivables of e31 million due to additional supplier benefits or rebates due to an increase in sales volumes partly offset by lower outstanding franchisee debtors due to improved management. Operating results were higher compared to the previous period in part because of a higher revenue and an increase in Gross Profit Margin. Our cash flow from operating activities for the six months ended August 4, 2019 amounted to an inflow of e50 million, primarily due to operating results of e38 million, which were partly offset by a cash outflow from the movements in working capital of e8 million, interest expenses of e27 million and a corporate income tax liability paid of e10 million. Our cash outflow from the movements in working capital was primarily due to higher inventories of e8 million due to an increased number of directlyowned stores, and the phasing out of supplier rebates of e19 million which was offset by a cash inflow of trade and other payables of e19 million due to higher stock intake and phasing. Depreciation has remained stable at e18 million. Our cash flow from operating activities for the year ended February 2, 2020, amounted to an inflow of e112 million, primarily due to operating results of e56 million, depreciation of e38 million, depreciation of right-of-use assets of e78 million as a result of the application of IFRS 16 and a cash inflow from movements in working capital of e16 million, partly offset by interest expenses of e58 million and a corporate income tax liability paid of e10 million. Our cash inflow from movements in working capital was mainly due to an inventory decrease of e7 million as a result of an inventory reduction program implemented to address high inventory levels and due to a decrease in trade and other receivables of e10 million due to stricter receivables management and the phasing of supplier rebates. The increase in interest expenses over the period was primarily due to the impact of IFRS 16 (e23 million). Our cash flow from operating activities for the year ended February 3, 2019, amounted to an inflow of e49 million, primarily due to operating results of e57 million and a cash inflow from the movements in working capital of e7 million, partly offset by interest expenses of e32 million and a corporate income tax liability paid of e10 million. Cash flow from the movements in working capital was mainly due to an increase in outstanding trade payables of e14 million at the end of the year as we had to replenish our 80 ----- weather related stock as a result of a successful season in 2018, offset by franchise receivables collection and phasing of supplier rebates of e15 million, which resulted in an increase in trade and other receivables. This inflow was partly offset by an increase in inventory of e22 million as a result of the Formido conversion, which resulted in inventory purchases and new floor plan, increased product density and the acquisition of other franchisee-operated stores such as Benimmo. Our cash inflow from operating activities was also lower due to a e8 million decrease in cash set aside for provisions, mainly related to good receivables management, the takeover of franchisee-operated stores and the settlement of claims. In addition, our depreciation and amortization has increased to e36 million as a result of investments in information and communication technologies and the acquisitions of Formido and Benimmo franchisee-operated stores. Our cash flow from operating activities for the year ended January 31, 2018, amounted to an inflow of e22 million, primarily due to operating results of e54 million, which were partly offset by negative cash flow from the movements in working capital of e11 million, interest expenses of e43 million and a corporate income tax liability paid of e8 million. Cash flow from the movement in inventory was stable and primarily related to purchases of inventory due to the increased product density in our stores and the addition of directly operated stores over the period, fully offset by an overall decrease of our inventory. Cash flow from the movement in trade and other payables for the year ended January 31, 2018, decreased by e8 million compared to the year ended January 31, 2017, mainly due to lower accruals (restructuring costs as at January 31, 2017), other taxes and social security contribution (early payment as at January 31, 2018) and lower payables due to lower stock intake. _Cash flow used in investing activities_ Cash used in investing activities principally relates to investments on growth in our trading space, the refurbishment and maintenance of our existing stores, concept changes, range review- related changes and the investment in our multi-channel platforms, our distribution center and IT as well as intangible assets.

Our most important trading period in terms of revenue, operating results and cash flow has historically been the spring and early summer, with 41% of our revenue in the year ended February 2, 2020 generated from April 1, 2019 to August 4, 2019, when we experience a significant increase in sales of outdoor and gardening products, among other things. During this season our revenue tends to outpace our creditor payments, resulting in negative working capital towards the end of the summer season. We require liquidity in order to fund such higher working capital needs, and we fund such liquidity from cash and/or drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility. For instance, for the six months ended August 2, 2020, our change in adjusted net working capital amounted to e138 million, primarily due to an increase in trade and other payables of e167 million and a decrease in inventories of e3 million which are partly offset by an increase in trade and other receivables of e31 million and a decrease in provisions of e1 million.

The Belgian DIY market is characterized by a stable pricing environment, with limited pricing pressure among competitors. A comparatively high rate of home ownership in Belgium and a focus on larger-scale projects to improve home comfort are reflected in higher sales of ‘‘non-mobile’’ products. In-store shopping predominates in Belgium (with comparatively low online sales), with large-format ‘‘big box’’ stores particularly popular in this market, contributing to higher sales densities and resulting margins. By contrast, the Dutch market is primarily driven by trends in the housing market (i.e. home sales and new-builds), and by smaller-scale maintenance, repair and decoration projects such as painting and flooring. Accordingly, smaller-format, conveniently located stores and online sales are more popular in the Netherlands, with higher relative shares of sales as compared to the Belgian market. In both markets, DIY specialty retailers face limited competition from hypermarkets (defined as large, diversified non-specialist retailers such as Action, HEMA or IKEA) and pure-play online players, and we believe that strong barriers to entry in our markets mitigate the potential for increased competition. In particular, potential new market entrants face long lead times for potential new stores which we estimate to be between four to six years, attributable to the limited availability of prime retail locations and the lengthy planning and permitting processes in Belgium and the Netherlands. New entrants would face pressure from well-established competitors with greater brand recognition and broader networks in seeking to build a sustainable and profitable presence in these countries. We also view the technical complexity of many DIY products and the challenges of appropriately managing inventory space as additional barriers to entry in markets where product choice and accessibility are key customer considerations. The COVID-19 crisis impacted the Belgian and Dutch DIY markets in different ways. The Dutch DIY retailers received no government mandate to close their stores in March and April 2020, while Belgian DIY retailers had to close all stores for the period starting March 18, 2020 until April 17, 2020. Despite the pandemic crisis and the store closure for a one month period in Belgium, we have observed an increase in the DIY markets in both countries in 2020, due to increased customer focus on home improvement and DIY. We believe that the pandemic has impacted customer behavior, with renewed customer appreciation of and focus on home.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,DIY market trends in Belgium and the Netherlands,18.2.1,,"We believe the trends outlined below are relevant in our markets and the development of our business. - Demographic changes: the overall growth in population and number of households is a driver of DIY spending, although the effect has been partly offset by a decrease in the number of people aged between 35 55, which is the age group that typically spends most time on home improvement. Consumer expenditure and the propensity of a population to change or improve their homes also constitute additional key drivers of the DIY spending. - Competition from pure play online retailers: increases in the DIY offering of pure play online retailers have a negative impact on traditional brick-and-mortar DIY incumbents. The share of Belgian and Dutch consumers buying DIY goods online, however, is still relatively limited 87 ----- (estimated for 2019 at approximately 6.5% in Belgium and approximately 10.6% in the Netherlands). The DIY market’s relatively low share of online sales in the Belgian and Dutch market are linked to a number of factors, including the dominance of in-store shopping (particularly in Belgium), DIY retailers’ late entry into the online channel and customer service requirements owing to the highly technical nature of many DIY products (i.e. advice on suitable product to solve a specific issue or meet a certain need). Nevertheless, online also plays a role in the DIY consumer market through product research, with significant customer trend for ‘‘Research Online, Purchase Offline (ROPO)’’. Major DIY retail chains are improving and expanding their online and omni-channel offerings, and should therefore be in a position to capture future online sales growth. - Indirect competition: diversification and growth from large non DIY retailers such as Action, HEMA or IKEA, generally present in both countries, has somewhat increased indirect competition with traditional DIY chains in certain product categories. However, this form of competition has not intensified recently, representing a stable and marginal share of the market, and Belgian and Dutch DIY specialty retailers have limited competition from hypermarkets. - Customer preference and focus on DIY and home improvement: DIY activity in Belgium and in the Netherlands has increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, demonstrating enhanced customer focus on home improvement and DIY, especially small home repairs. This trend has been confirmed post lockdown and even during summer period, with catch-up effect on larger projects and repairs.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

These consumers dedicate their own time while saving costs through not hiring a professional, driving the bulk of revenue to home improvement retailers. A second consumer group that exists is made of those who prefer to hire professionals to complete home improvements and maintenance. This can range from extensive work, such as kitchen installation, to small tasks for maintenance people; such as hanging a lamp or installing a shelf. As the economy strengthens, this group tends to grow in the Netherlands, which we believe can put increasing pressure on home improvement players.

As of August 2, 2020, our franchisee-operated stores were owned and operated by an aggregate of 86 franchisees, with the largest franchisee operating 6 stores. Historically, franchisees enabled us to quickly add significant scale at a low investment rate. Our franchisee-operated stores conform to our standardized store layout that we have established for each store brand and offer a predetermined range of SKUs tailored to that store brand, as adjusted to reflect the location’s specific attributes. From the customer’s perspective, there are generally no visible differences between our directly operated stores and franchisee-operated stores. _Franchise agreements_ Across our three store brands, we had 121 stores under franchise agreements with 86 unique franchise partners as of August 2, 2020. Our standard franchise agreement varies by store brand, but generally allows franchisees to carry and use our brand names. Under our arrangements with our franchisees, we supply products and operational support to the franchisee-operated stores. For instance, we may enter into a head lease with respect to a store location and sublet such property to a franchisee to the extent necessary for our franchisees to secure suitable premises for operating one of our franchises. We work together with our franchisees to agree on which product offerings are best suited to each local market and, in Belgium, our franchisees can choose to externally source up to 10% of their in-store product offering. The success of our franchisee-operated stores requires our franchisees to have a strong, well-funded capital base and local retail knowledge to support the initial store launch. Under certain separate agreements with our franchisees or their lenders, we may enter into buyback commitments whereby we undertake to repurchase inventory and stock from a franchisee or its lender in the event the franchisee defaults under its financing arrangements with local banks. Typically, these financing arrangements are entered into in connection with store openings and inventory purchases. Previously, in limited circumstances, we repurchased inventory from certain of our franchisees or their 105 ----- lenders, but were able to utilize this inventory in other stores in our network. We believe our relations with our franchisees are good. In addition, we are responsible for funding and implementing national marketing campaigns and organizing in-store marketing for all our stores, including franchisee-operated stores (as funded by the franchise fee we charge our franchisees). We do not have specific advertisement programs in place for franchisees in their local markets and do not incur capital expenditures in relation to the franchiseeoperated stores, as those costs are committed and paid directly by franchisees. We do not include franchisee costs when recording our own capital expenditures. In limited circumstances, we may incur certain capital expenditures on behalf of our franchisees, primarily in relation to the expansion of our franchisee-operated stores in Belgium, in which case our contribution would typically range between e0.1 million and e0.4 million per year. We also incurred certain capital expenditures in relation to the conversion of certain franchisee-operated Formido stores to the Praxis brand. Because we do not incur significant capital expenditures in connection with opening new franchisee-operated stores and, therefore, carry less financial risk, franchisee-operated stores allow us to expand our network more quickly than we would if we opened directly operated stores. In particular, our franchise network allows us to improve proximity to our customers in smaller towns and villages. We select franchise partners that demonstrate an ability to secure entry into appropriate prime retail locations, to trade in accordance with our high operating standards and to grow the business in line with our mutually agreed business plans. From time to time, our franchisees may be required to make capital expenditures to refresh the layout of their stores and to fund operational updates, including for IT. Products ordered through our digital channel and collected by customers in a franchisee store are recorded as sales performed in the store of that franchisee. From time to time, our franchisees’ performance may fall below our jointly agreed performance levels or a franchisee may fail to pay for inventory or certain mandatory fees. In such cases, we generally work with our franchisees to seek performance improvements or work out arrangements to receive payments in line with our contractual rights. If we are unsuccessful, we may then seek to exit the contractual relationship or to buy the store from the franchisee. Historically, we believe that we have had good relationships with franchisees, with the majority of our franchisees opting for renewal upon the expiration of their agreements. Generally our franchise agreements provide us with a consent right in connection with any assignment by the franchisee and a right of first refusal in favor of us if the relevant franchisee would like to sell their business. In addition, the franchise agreement may, in certain circumstances, be terminated if the store manager or owner changes. To protect our store brands, the franchise agreements also usually place non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee, at least for the duration of the contract and sometimes for a one-year period following the termination of the franchise agreement. Brico We had 77 Brico stores operating under franchise agreements with 56 unique franchise partners as of August 2, 2020. The Brico franchise agreements have a standard term of nine years and provide for a renewal consultation twelve to 18 months prior to expiration. In our Brico franchisee-operated stores, fees consist of a one-off fee to Brico, fees for operational support and certain commission fees, based on a fixed percentage of Brico’s related supply and logistic costs. In addition to the payment of the fees as described above, our Brico franchisees are also further required to provide premises for the stores and to purchase stock directly from us and our agreed suppliers as they deem fit. Brico franchisees can choose to externally source up to 10% of their in-store product offering. The Brico franchisees are represented by their own committee (Committee de Concertation) and Brico is required to consult the committee before taking important decisions that will impact the franchise formula. Under Belgian law, Brico is required to make substantial pre-contractual information disclosures in its capacity as franchisor before a franchise agreement is executed. We have instituted policies and procedures to ensure our compliance with the relevant disclosure requirements, including the use of a standardized pre-contractual information document, which we complete with specific information on each franchiseeoperated Brico store and divulge in each instance Brico is required to make such disclosure. In the event of noncompliance, the franchisee can invoke the nullity of the agreement up to two years after the execution of the agreement. As of August 2, 2020, there were seven franchise agreements within the first two years of their execution in Belgium, and there had been no material proceedings based on noncompliance with these requirements. 106 ----- Praxis We had 44 Praxis stores operating under franchise agreements with 30 franchise partners as of August 2, 2020. The Praxis franchise agreements have a standard term of five years with an automatic renewal period of five years after such initial term and a one-year termination notice period, which may be exercised by either party following this five-year term. The franchisee pays us a single fee calculated as a percentage of its turnover. Praxis franchisees have a right of first refusal with respect to opening additional Praxis stores in their exclusive area. Under the franchise agreements, the franchisee is required to provide premises for the stores and to purchase at least a minimum amount of stock from us based on expected volume requirements calculated by Praxis’s automated stock management systems. Praxis franchisees are in principle not permitted to offer deviating merchandise and services. The Praxis franchisees are represented by their own committee (Vereniging Praxis Aangesloten Bedrijven) which must approve certain changes to the Praxis ‘‘franchise formula,’’ which consists of several elements described in the Praxis franchise agreements, including the look and feel of the franchisee-operated store, the technical know-how provided by us and the product assortment range. As of August 2, 2020, there were eleven franchise agreements within the first two years of their execution in the Netherlands, and there had been no material proceedings based on noncompliance with these requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Established in 1973, Brico is the DIY market leader in Belgium, with a market share of approximately 29% in the Belgian DIY Market in terms of Transactional Sales for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, according to GfK. Brico offers a wide range of DIY, home decoration and garden products with 28,000 to 50,000 SKUs stocked per store. The average floor surface area of our directly operated Brico stores is approximately 3,300 square meters and the average floor surface area of our franchisee-operated Brico stores is approximately 1,800 square meters. Brico’s three largest product groups are paint, paint specialties and accessories, and hardware. Brico accounted for 31% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. BricoPlanit:_** We directly operate all 13 of our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores in Belgium under the BricoPlanit brand, the only pure DIY Big Box format in Belgium. Established in 2004, our BricoPlanit brand is known for its chain of DIY megastores in Belgium with a market share of approximately 15% in the Belgian DIY Market in terms of Transactional Sales for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, according to GfK. BricoPlanit offers a large range of products for home improvement projects, with approximately 49,000 SKUs stocked per store and an average floor surface area of approximately 9,000 square meters. BricoPlanit’s three largest product groups are indoor and construction products, flooring and building materials.

The floor surface area of our ‘‘standard’’ Praxis stores is approximately 3,000 square meters for directly operated stores and approximately 2,900 square meters for franchiseeoperated stores. Praxis’s largest product groups are paint, flooring, and indoor and construction products. Praxis accounted for 50% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. 91 ----- We operate our three brands across three store formats, ‘‘City’’ stores, ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores and ‘‘Big Box’’ stores, through which we target distinct customers and project requirements. Each of our store formats offers a unique focus: City Stores:_** Our ‘‘City’’ stores, consisting of our _Brico City and_ _Praxis City sub-brands, in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively, are located in city centers. These stores are generally small in size and focus on providing convenient access to products for routine, small-scale maintenance and repair projects, targeting both first-time and more experienced DIY consumers with basic home repair or improvement needs. Mid Box Stores:_** Our ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores consist of our Brico stores in Belgium and our Praxis stores in the Netherlands. These stores are larger in size and provide a wider range of products for larger maintenance, repair, decoration and renovation projects, targeting both first-time and more experienced DIY consumers undertaking decorative or home improvement projects that might require more resources than our ‘‘City’’ stores can provide. Big Box Stores:_** Our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores consist of our BricoPlanit stores in Belgium and our Praxis Mega and Praxis Mega & Garden stores in the Netherlands. These stores are our largest, and provide our most extensive range of products for a variety of home improvement projects, primarily targeting consumers experienced in DIY projects who are shopping for more-technical products for large DIY projects and for more-expensive decorative items. Our digital distribution channel is growing, with over 40 million online visits and e34 million in online sales (excluding Click & Collect), or 2% of our revenue, for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We operate our digital distribution channel through two websites, one for our Brico and BricoPlanit brands in Belgium and one for our Praxis brand in the Netherlands, in order to meet customer demand for an omnichannel shopping experience and provide greater and more convenient access to our products. In addition to traditional home delivery services, all of our store brands offer a ‘‘Click & Reserve’’ option, which allows customers to order products that do not require assembly or which the customer decides to assemble themselves online and pick up in-store, and a ‘‘Click & Collect’’ option, which allows customers to order products that require assembly and pick them up in store after they have been assembled by our specialists, each of which we believe increases the likelihood of additional or ancillary purchases by the customer. We have also opened a distribution center exclusively dedicated to our online sales. Through our Brico, BricoPlanit and Praxis digital channels, we also provide the option of Drop Shipment, whereby products are shipped directly from the supplier to the customer’s home. We aim to continue to develop our mobile phone and tablet applications across our store brands, enhancing the way we present our products to users and increasing the channels through which consumers can purchase them. We aim to offer our customers a strong value proposition through a comprehensive product assortment across five product categories: (i) decorating, which includes painting and lighting products, (ii) building, which includes wood, flooring and doors, (iii) tools, electrical and hardware, which includes drills and other tools and instruments, (iv) gardening, which includes garden power tools, outdoors furniture and garden wood products, and (v) installation, sanitary and kitchen, which includes plumbing products, taps and heating instruments. We aim to maximize customer choice through a multi-brand strategy that combines a wide offering of top-level branded products selectively complemented by our private label products. In the year ended February 2, 2020, we derived 74% of our Transactional Sales from third-party branded products and the remaining 26% from our private label products.

We have adapted to evolving consumer habits by opening smaller outlets in city centers and by investing in our online presence. We have an extensive footprint of 150 Brico and BricoPlanit stores in Belgium and 195 Praxis stores in the Netherlands and also operate three Brico stores in Luxembourg. According to data compiled by GfK, our Brico and BricoPlanit store brands held a combined market share of approximately 44% of the Belgian DIY Market for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We have a particularly strong presence in selected highly populated regions such as Brussels where, according to a retail marketing agency, Brico and BricoPlanit represented an estimated 90% of market share by Transactional Sales for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We also enjoy a strong position in the Netherlands, where we estimate that we are the second-largest DIY retailer in terms of Transactional Sales, with a total of 195 stores trading under our well-established Praxis brand and a combined market share of 25% of the Dutch DIY Superstores Market for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We have benefitted from our online strategy and omnichannel capabilities, in particular during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our market share in Belgium and the Netherlands is supported by our long-standing presence, extensive market knowledge and strong brand visibility in these markets. We believe that the insight gained from our extensive trading history in Belgium and the Netherlands is a competitive advantage relative to new market entrants, because it positions us to identify prime retail locations and capitalize on local customer preferences.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Our physical network of 348 stores across Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg comprises stores with three distinct but complementary value propositions tailored to their respective geographic regions and target customers. Our ‘‘City’’ stores are designed for maximum convenience, with small surface areas in high population density locations and a specialized product range focused on immediate maintenance and repair needs. Our ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores are larger in size, with an emphasis on a superior in-store experience and an extensive range of DIY, home decoration and gardening products for small and large projects. Our ‘‘Big Box’’ stores are destination stores offering our widest array of products, including those required for large-scale renovations and decorative projects. The broad product offering across each of our three store formats is complemented by knowledgeable staff and expert advice tailored to the product category and specific customer need. Our complementary store formats, expert in-store advice and tailored product offerings allow us to service the full range of our customers’ DIY requirements, from one-off convenience purchases to large projects. We have also developed a ‘‘Do-It-For-Me’’ platform in Belgium and the Netherlands through which customers can find third-party professionals who can perform their DIY jobs. We allow these professionals to register on our platform and we then let customers pick the specialist they need. We aim to offer our customers a strong value proposition through a comprehensive product assortment across product categories. Our stores stock well-established brands such as Grohe, Gardena, Black & Decker, Akzo, Bosch, Knauf, Flexa and Signify. We also have distribution arrangements in place with certain key suppliers to distribute certain of their branded products exclusively in our stores and online in Belgium and the Netherlands. We seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors and to boost our range innovation by also offering our private label products as alternatives or complements to our branded offering in certain product categories such as power tools, hand tools and gardening products. With our private label products, we aim to offer equivalent quality and superior value to comparable branded products at a variety of price points through our ‘‘good,’’ ‘‘better’’ and ‘‘best’’ product ranges. The margins generated on our private label products are on average approximately 23% higher than the margins on the equivalent branded products we sell. For the year ended February 2, 2020 we generated 74% of our Transactional Sales from third-party branded products and 26% of our Transactional Sales from our private label products.

We selectively open new stores in localities where we are not present and where we have identified demand for our products. Our franchise arrangements enable us to reduce the risk associated with growing our network and expanding into new localities. We seek franchise partners with the relevant expertise, specialized market knowledge and local networks required to rapidly succeed in each market, and we permit our franchisees limited flexibility to tailor a portion of their product offering to specialized local demands. However, we maintain robust, centralized control over our stores, products and messaging, thereby ensuring consistent product offerings and the uniform implementation of display and marketing initiatives across all stores. Through this combination of directly operated stores and franchisee-operated stores, we are able to efficiently leverage our well-known store brands and extend our geographic reach. We have selectively sought to convert franchisee stores to directly operated stores in selected formats during the past three years in line with our store optimization focus, and the percentage of our stores that are directly owned has increased from 53% as of April 30, 2017 to 65% as of August 2, 2020. Our brick-and-mortar stores are complemented by our two websites for the Brico and BricoPlanit brands and the Praxis brands allowing us to reach customers who may prefer to order online and who have difficulties in reaching our stores. Our extensive store network and online product offering is supplied by an efficient, diversified and flexible sourcing model that we believe, combined with the large scale of our operations, helps us to obtain favorable commercial terms with our key suppliers and preserve our margins. In recent years, we have made substantial investments in streamlining our supply chain, including the consolidation of procurement functions for Brico, BricoPlanit and Praxis in an effort to maximize synergies between our brands and leverage their combined scale in negotiations with suppliers. Our vendor management team also benefits from the A.R.E.N.A. Alliance, a procurement partnership with seven other retail groups focused on the sourcing and negotiation of supplies of DIY, garden and home improvement products. As of August 2, 2020, we sourced our products from diversified base of over 700 suppliers located primarily in Belgium, the Netherlands and Asia, compared to 900 as of April 30, 2017. We have developed our own Asian sourcing platform since 2011, which we renamed Surity. Surity negotiates and contracts directly with Asia-based suppliers through an office in Shanghai, China. We have been able to leverage knowledge of local markets through this partnership, which also improved our profitability as direct sourcing results in higher margins. In addition, we have implemented a margin enhancement program with the aim of building longer-term relationships with our key suppliers, reducing costs, optimizing the efficiency of our supplier base, concentrating spend and ensuring the quality and security of the supply for a number of our key products. Our procurement initiatives are supported by our SITI program, a lean inventory policy aiming to structurally decrease stock and improve working capital. We have minimized our inventory footprint, operating a single central warehouse (located between Antwerp and Brussels), which supplies our stores in both Belgium and the Netherlands with most of our products. This central warehouse is complemented by a smaller specialized warehouse in Ninove, Belgium, which supplies our stores with wood and construction products, and two ‘‘flow through’’ dock centers (one in Vianen, the Netherlands and one in Bornem, Belgium), which have helped us to efficiently manage our inventory and reduce our distribution costs. We also have a new distribution center in Roermond, the Netherlands, exclusively dedicated to the delivery of products ordered through our online sales channels, the operation of which we have contracted to a third party. We occupy approximately 100,000 square meters of warehouse space.

Among other things, our ‘‘Back to Simplicity’’ strategy focused on terminating the Praxis Garden franchise format by closing our three remaining Praxis Garden stores in 2017, simplifying our administrative functions by centralizing our headquarters in Belgium and relocating our Amsterdam headquarters, reducing our fixed cost base by renegotiating rents at many of our Praxis stores and investing in our employees and their ability to increase customer satisfaction including by offering general and specialized DIY knowledge, renegotiating our collective bargaining agreement in Belgium, and reducing our electricity costs through the installation of LED lighting at our stores and offices. We initiated the second phase of our plan, our ‘‘Back to Basics’’ strategy in 2017, with the aim of enhancing our customer value proposition through the creation of a new cohesive store format across our Brico, BricoPlanit and Praxis brands, reinforcing our positioning in key product categories, enhancing efficiency of operations and customer service and building commitment from our employees through employee investment, training and empowerment. We have improved the visual identity of our stores and have sought to optimize our inventory offering by conducting a range review across all formats. We have launched a leadership path for store employees and implemented systems to train our employees to be more familiar with our products. In addition, we conducted reviews our store portfolio across all brands, resulting in the opening of 17 new stores, the relocation of four existing stores and the remodeling of six existing stores. As a result of these initiatives, we operate a profitable portfolio of stores and for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, we had only two stores with negative Adjusted EBITDA in Belgium and one store with negative Adjusted EBITDA in the Netherlands. Other stores that had been loss making in prior periods have either been converted to newly-opened City stores in the Netherlands or closed or sold to franchisees in Belgium. We have also identified specific initiatives for the remaining stores with negative Adjusted EBITDA, such as rent renegotiation, active marketing campaign or store closure. We also successfully phased out our Formido brand in the Netherlands. We converted 40 of our Formido stores into Praxis stores, refurbishing these stores and the products they offer to reflect the Praxis brand image, sold 23 stores, and closed the remaining 11 Formido stores. This initiative strengthened our Praxis brand, and we have maintained our market share in the Netherlands through the conversion process. All of our stores in the Netherlands are now operated under the Praxis brand. After conversion to the Praxis brand, the 30 best-performing converted Formido stores has experienced an average gross margin increase of 25% per store for the year ended February 3, 2019, compared to the year ended January 31, 2018, with the five best-performing converted Formido stores experiencing increases in gross margins of 50% on average. We also successfully completed our e-commerce optimization as part of our ‘‘Back to Basics’’ strategy, and have become the leading DIY omnichannel retailer in Benelux, with a variety of sales and delivery channels and the development of our two new, more flexible and mobile-friendly, websites designed to maximize the accessibility of our products. We have invested in the features and functionality of our branded online channels in an effort to diversify our revenue streams and capture a greater share of the growing DIY e-commerce market in Belgium and the Netherlands. For example, we combined the two websites for our Brico and BricoPlanit brands in Belgium, and we now have one website for our Brico and BricoPlanit brands for the Belgian market and one website for our Praxis brand for the Dutch market. These websites offer online ordering capabilities and detailed information on our products. We have also opened a distribution center exclusively dedicated to the delivery of products ordered through our online sales channels in order to improve the speed and efficiency of our delivery of online orders. The expansion of our digital platform and the integration of online capabilities into our physical stores, such as in-store tablets and Wi-Fi access points in all our stores for the ordering of products unavailable in stores, has also had a positive impact on our profitability, as it is less costly to fulfill orders that are picked up in our stores through our Click & Collect and Click & Reserve services than orders that are delivered directly to our customers. We also focus on community interaction, and distribute inspirational DIY videos explaining DIY techniques to our customers and potential customers in order to increase brand loyalty and showcase products available in our stores.

Even though governments in Belgium and the Netherlands implemented measures to contain the spread of the virus and these measures affected our business operations, along with those of other retailers in the markets in which we operate, the growth of Belgian and Dutch DIY markets significantly accelerated since the beginning of 2020. This was partly due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which resulted in strong customer focus on home improvements and DIY projects, especially small home repairs. This trend accelerated when governments eased lockdown measures in June 2020, with customers in Belgium resuming DIY projects that they were unable to complete due to the closure of stores in Belgium, as illustrated in the following graphs (according to GfK): 10SEP202018085811 While we initially experienced a substantial decrease in sales in Belgium due to store closures, our stores subsequently experienced sales growth in late April, May and June, and sales in those months were higher than for the comparative months in 2019, primarily due to increased DIY activity as a result of our customers spending more time at home and in their gardens. Our stores in the Netherlands remained open throughout the pandemic, with limited opening hours, and performed well, and our sales in the Netherlands for the period from March to June were higher than for the comparable period in 2019, as customers increasingly focused on DIY home improvements, which we presume resulted from increased time spent at home as well as adapting the home space for additional functions including school and work. We incurred e9 million in costs incurred for additional health and safety measures in our stores during the six months ended August 2, 2020. We believe that the improvements implemented as part of our strategic initiatives, allowed us to take advantage of this trend and contributed to our business’ strong performance during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, most of the Formido stores that we converted to Praxis are small stores that 96 10SEP202018085811 ----- consumers favored during the pandemic outbreak, which confirmed our strategy to focus on a diversified multi-format platform.

These stores are generally small in size and focus on providing convenient access to products for routine, small-scale maintenance and repair projects. Our ‘‘City’’ stores operate with the following goal: ‘‘We offer a quick and nearby solution for your essential and immediate DIY needs.’’ Our ‘‘City’’ stores target both first-time and more-experienced DIY consumers with basic home repair or improvement needs. Our ‘‘City’’ store customers prioritize convenience and efficiency, often shopping for products for immediate use or those they may have forgotten to purchase during their larger shopping trips. - Mid Box Stores: Our ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores consist of our Brico stores in Belgium and our Praxis stores in the Netherlands. These stores are larger in size and provide a wider range of products for larger maintenance, repair, decoration and renovation projects.

Each of our three store brands offers different ranges of products to meet their respective target customers’ preferences and needs. Each of our three store brands carries substantially the same core product categories, with smaller stores carrying a more limited assortment within each product category. Our store brands feature distinct layouts and typically carry between 8,000 and 65,000 SKUs, of which between 4,000 and 29,5000 are typically private label products, depending on the season, store size and store brand. Although we largely standardize assortment and layout among stores of the same store brand, within each we may tailor some stores to the characteristics of a specific geographic area. For example, a store close to a big camping site may offer additional products to cater for camping activities. _Belgium_ In Belgium, we operate a number of different formats across our two store brands: Brico and BricoPlanit. Under the Brico brand, we operate Brico, Briko Depot and Brico City stores that cater to different geographic markets. Under the BricoPlanit store brand, we offer a differentiated ‘‘Big Box’’ store format with extensive ranges that target consumers looking for products for larger DIY projects. Collectively, our Belgian business accounted for 50% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, including the revenue contribution of our three Brico stores in Luxembourg. We had a market share of 44% of the Belgian DIY Market in terms of Transactional Sales for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. Brico Brico is the DIY market leader in Belgium with a market share of approximately 29% of the Belgian DIY Market in terms of Transactional Sales for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. Brico offers a wide range of DIY, home decoration and garden products, combining third-party branded products with our private label products, with 28,000 to 50,000 SKUs stocked per store. Brico’s three largest product groups are paint, paint specialties and accessories, and hardware. Higher price point garden and wood products drive customer traffic to stores but the demand for garden products varies seasonally. Brico accounted for 31% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. As of August 2, 2020, Brico has a network of 140 stores, including 77 franchisee-operated stores. The average floor surface area of our directly operated stores is approximately 3,300 square meters and the average floor surface area of our franchisee-operated stores is approximately 1,800 square meters. Under the Brico brand, we operate two main types of stores: ‘‘City’’ stores and ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores. Our suburban stores comprise standard Brico stores, which are our largest store type in terms of selling area with a surface area between 1,700 square meters and 7,400 square meters for our directly operated stores, and a surface area between 900 square meters and 4,200 square meters for our franchisee 102 ----- operated stores, as well as our Briko Depot sub-branded store with a surface area of approximately 9,200 square meters, which we still position as a ‘‘Mid Box’’ store format. Our ‘‘City’’ stores comprise our _Brico City sub-branded stores, which as stores in the more confined spaces of city centers, provide for a_ surface area between approximately 300 square meters and 800 square meters, and offer products for smaller DIY jobs and maintenance. During recent years, we have undertaken the expansion of our Brico network through new store openings. Despite existing nationwide coverage, we have identified areas of potential expansion where we do not currently operate any Brico stores. We believe there is potential for two to three Brico store openings per year, either directly operated or franchisee operated. Furthermore, as part of our strategic plan, we intend to refurbish three to four selected Brico stores per year over the next three years and we plan to convert three Brico stores to the BricoPlanit brand. BricoPlanit Under our BricoPlanit store brand, we operate a chain of DIY megastores in Belgium that offer large ranges of products for home improvement projects with approximately 49,000 SKUs per store. While we advertise BricoPlanit to a broad group of consumers, its customer base is skewed towards customers who are more experienced in DIY projects. With our BricoPlanit stores, we mainly focus on customers who are renovating their homes, offering an extensive range of products for home improvement projects, including building materials such as plaster and mortar, as well as wood products, paint and wallpaper. BricoPlanit’s three largest product groups are indoor and construction products, flooring and building materials. BricoPlanit accounted for 19% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. We operate 13 BricoPlanit stores in Belgium under our ‘‘Big Box’’ store format (five stores in Flanders, seven in Wallonia and one in Brussels), all of which we directly operate. Compared with our other store formats and those of our competitors, our BricoPlanit stores are particularly large, with sizes from 6,900 square meters to 11,000 square meters and average floor surface areas of approximately 9,000 square meters. Our sales density at our BricoPlanit stores is the highest in the Belgian DIY market, with approximately e3,000 revenue per square meter. We consistently increased the market share (in terms of Transactional Sales) of our BricoPlanit stores between 2017 and 2020 through improved Like-for-Like Sales and the opening of a new BricoPlanit store in Waterloo, Belgium. For the year ended February 2, 2020, the BricoPlanit brand had a market share of approximately 15% of the Belgian DIY Market by Transactional Sales. We occasionally convert large Brico stores to BricoPlanit stores. _The Netherlands_ In the Netherlands, we operate our stores under the Praxis brand. Our Praxis stores include a range of ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores, with or without a garden center, and Praxis City stores. Until 2019, we operated certain stores in the Netherlands under the Formido brand. We have phased this brand out and all Formido stores have either been closed or converted to Praxis stores. Our Dutch business accounted for 50% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. Praxis Praxis is our leading DIY concept in the Netherlands with a market share of approximately 25% of the Dutch DIY Superstores Market in terms of Transactional Sales as of August 2, 2020, according to GfK. Through our Praxis brand, we employ a multi-channel strategy, adapted to consumers’ different DIY shopping preferences. We offer a broad product assortment ranging between 8,000 to 65,000 SKUs to meet the needs of both experienced and novice DIY enthusiasts. Praxis’s largest product groups are paint, flooring, and indoor and construction products. Higher price point garden and wood products help drive customer traffic to stores. Praxis accounted for 50% of our revenue for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020. Under the Praxis brand, we operate a network of 195 stores across the Netherlands as of August 2, 2020, including 44 franchisee-operated stores, under five sub-brands: Praxis Mega & Garden, with an average surface area of approximately 11,900 square meters; Praxis Mega, with an average surface area of approximately 5,900 square meters; _Praxis City ‘‘City’’ stores, with an average surface area of approximately 300 square meters; and ‘‘standard’’ Praxis stores with an average surface area of 103 ----- approximately 3,000 square meters. The average floor surface area of our standard directly operated Praxis stores is approximately 3,000 square meters and the average surface area of our franchisees’ standard Praxis stores is approximately 2,900 square meters. We have expanded our network of ‘‘City’’ stores in the Netherlands under the Praxis City brand, focusing on a smaller city-specific assortment of products while linking customers digitally to our broader assortment of products. As part of the strategic plan, we have opened ten directly operated Praxis City stores over the past six years. In addition, we have converted a portion of our Formido stores into Praxis stores as part of the phasing out of our Formido brand, refurbishing such stores and the products offered therein to reflect the Praxis brand image. Of the 74 Formido stores that we operated as of January 31, 2018, 40 stores were converted into Praxis stores, 23 stores were sold and the remaining 11 stores were closed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Of our franchiseeoperated stores, 44 are located in the Netherlands and 77 are located in Belgium. 14% of our stores are larger than 5,000 square meters and the majority of our stores are between 3,000 and 5,000 square meters as of August 2, 2020. The average cost of opening a new store is highly dependent on the size of the store. New ‘‘City’’ stores typically require us to incur capital expenditures of between e0.2 million and e0.4 million. New ‘‘Mid Box’’ stores typically require us to incur capital expenditures of between e1.0 million and e2.5 million. New ‘‘Big Box’’ stores typically require us to incur capital expenditures of between e3.0 million and e4.5 million. The cost of opening new stores, however, can vary based on several factors and may exceed the amounts we have incurred historically. In addition, from time to time and in order to increase profitability, we may convert our directly operated stores into franchisee-operated stores and vice versa. For example, we may convert our directly operated stores into franchisee-operated stores in Belgium where labor costs are typically 20% to 25% lower for franchisee-operated stores. In contrast, in the Netherlands, labor costs are typically comparable for directly operated stores and franchisee-operated stores, but we may convert our directly operated stores into franchisee-operated stores in order to reduce our working capital or capital expenditures. Franchisees also allow us to expand into smaller towns and villages and provide valuable local expertise. In addition, when franchisee-operated stores are in financial difficulty, we may convert such stores into directly operated stores in order to increase profitability. Additionally, we may decide to convert certain stores operating under one of our store brands into stores to be operated under another of our store brands through, for example, the conversion of certain of our larger Brico stores into BricoPlanit stores in an effort to improve profitability. During the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, our directly operated stores (including Click & Collect) in Belgium and Luxembourg accounted for 42% of our revenue from our total stores, and our directly operated stores (including Click & Collect) in the Netherlands accounted for 40% of our revenue from our total stores. Across all geographies, our directly operated stores (including Click & Collect) accounted for 83% of our revenue and our franchisee-operated stores accounted for 15% of our revenue during the twelve months ended August 2, 2020.

Our ‘‘Big Box’’ BricoPlanit stores, in particular, are destination stores offering our broadest product assortments, making them a ‘‘one-stop shop’’ for both large and small DIY projects. In the year ended February 2, 2020 we derived 74% of our Transactional Sales from third-party branded products and the remaining 26% from our private label products. _Third-party branded products_ We stock third-party branded products, including from premium suppliers such as Grohe, Gardena, Black & Decker, Akzo, Bosch, Knauf, Flexa and Signify. We have distribution arrangements in place with certain of our key suppliers, such as one of our Asian suppliers, Positec, pursuant to which we have the exclusive right in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to sell Positec’s hand held power 107 ----- tools under three of its brands (Worx, Xceed and Rockwell) in our stores and online, thereby differentiating us from our competitors. _Private label products_ The creation and management of our private label products is a fundamental element of our business strategy. We believe that our private label products help to differentiate us from other DIY retailers, boost our ability to execute range innovation and, since they are sold exclusively through our network of stores, permit us to more effectively attract and retain customers over time. In addition, our private label products typically carry higher margins. We position our private label products based on customer perception, price and quality. We price our private label product portfolio according to the categories below: - ‘‘Good’’: We offer basic products in all product categories across a limited number of SKUs and such private label products are offered at budget prices. Such private label products are of basic quality and include paint, hand tools and accessories as well as easy-to-use power tools for the less experienced DIY customer. Our main ‘‘Good’’ brand is Baseline. Our Transactional Sales originated from ‘‘Good’’ products remained stable at 3% for the year ended February 2, 2020, compared to 3% for the year ended January 31, 2017. - ‘‘Better’’: We stock mid-price products under our private labels, which are competitively priced compared to third-party branded products and we seek to maintain their quality and price in line with our competitors’ private label products. We sell such products to provide a broad range of choice that offers an attractive alternative for third-party branded products. We have a number of private labels, which include Sencys, AquaVive, Central Park, Decomode and MXpower. We believe that the quality of our ‘‘Better’’ products is comparable to those of the leading third-party branded products. We designed this product range for easy, everyday use for both experienced and inexperienced DIY customers. Our Transactional Sales originated from ‘‘Better’’ products decreased to 21% for the year ended February 2, 2020, compared to 26% for the year ended January 31, 2017. - ‘‘Best’’: Our ‘‘Best’’ products comprise our highest quality products that seek to compete with, and are priced comparably to, independent third-party branded products. Our ‘‘Best’’ product brand names include Perfection, Acker, Teck and Aquazuro. These products seek to offer quality that is equal to or exceeds leading independent third-party branded products. Our Maxeda ‘‘Best’’ products represent a customer proposition of added value in terms of new, extra or better features compared to our ‘‘Good’’ and ‘‘Better’’ products. Due to our desire to provide superior quality, these product ranges are limited to a selective assortment of product categories, which can meet our rigorous ‘‘Best’’ branded product quality standards. Our Transactional Sales originated from ‘‘Best’’ products increased to 3% for the year ended February 2, 2020, compared to 2% for the year ended January 31, 2017. _Exclusive brands_ We have entered into certain exclusive distribution agreements for the exclusive distribution of certain branded products in the markets in which we operate. For example, in 2019 we entered into an agreement with French paint producer Renaulac for the exclusive distribution of Renaulac-branded products in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

Our pricing strategy also includes the use of promotions and a limited number of ‘‘every day low price’’ items. We use these pricing positions to offer lower prices for items purchased frequently, which we believe enhances brand and value perception among our customers. We use promotions with focused marketing campaigns to draw traffic to our stores, including sending promotional emails with personalized material based on a customer’s buying patterns and preferences.

For the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, the average transactional value for our digital channel was approximately e102 per transaction, and our online sales (excluding Click & Collect) accounted for 2% of our revenue. We intend to continue our focus on increasing sales and revenue derived from our digital channel and utilizing data collected through our online activities to improve our understanding of our customers. We also intend to continue the development of our online services. These services currently include the Click & Collect service, the ‘‘order in-store’’ service, for which we have now deployed in-store tablet devices and Wi-Fi access points, the Drop Shipment Model and further expansion into mobile commerce, which provides additional flexibility for our customers by enabling them to access our online store through our mobile phone and tablet applications across our store brands, enhancing the way we can present our products to users. We have strengthened our e-commerce operations following the COVID-19 outbreak given the decrease in footfall in our stores and an increase in customer preference for purchasing products online. We believe this will be a long-term trend impacting our business and we intend to develop our digital channel accordingly. Our proportion of revenues generated by our e-commerce operations as compared to our total revenues has historically been higher in the Netherlands than in Belgium, although this gap has diminished for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020 due to increased online sales in Belgium in March and April 2020, when our stores in Belgium were closed due to lockdown measures. In Belgium, our online sales (excluding Click & Collect) accounted for 0.7% of our total sales for the twelve months ended August 2, 2020.

Our supply chain mainly consists of: - our group supply chain, based in Amsterdam and responsible for general logistics management and planning, which also contains a team of demand planners, a master data team and inventory managers; and - our logistics operations, based in Willebroek and responsible for logistics management, inventory and purchase management, and financial management.

We also operate two ‘‘flow through’’ dock centers (one in Vianen, the Netherlands and one in Bornem, Belgium), which have helped us to efficiently manage our inventory and reduce our distribution costs. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with a third party to operate a distribution center in Roermond, the Netherlands, which is exclusively dedicated to the delivery of products ordered through our online sales channels and through which 20,000 SKUs are distributed to our online customers. Our total warehouse space amounts to approximately 100,000 square meters. Our distribution centers carry inventory, whereas the flow through centers do not have inventory. We utilize flow through centers for consolidating pre-picked orders from different suppliers into consolidated deliveries to our stores. We have entered into a handling and transport agreement with ID Logistics, which expires on September 30, 2028, pursuant to which ID Logistics operates our distribution center in Belgium. ID Logistics started to operate our distribution center in October 2016. Our distribution center lease expires on December 31, 2027.

In the twelve months ended August 2, 2020, our ten largest suppliers accounted for 23% of our overall supply cost, with no one supplier accounting for more than 6% of our overall spend. We also contract with Surity, a sourcing platform in Asia that we established and formerly owned for the sourcing of the majority of our supplies from Asia. The total value of our purchases from suppliers in Asia amounted to approximately e95 million for the year ended August 2, 2020. The total amount of inventory purchased from Asia has decreased from 12% in the year ended February 3, 2019, to 11% in the year ended February 2, 2020, as we are working to reduce our level of sourcing from Asia in order to reduce our inventory to more efficient levels and improve working capital. The remainder of our inventory is purchased from suppliers primarily located in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France. The conditions of our agreements with our suppliers are contained in a vendor manual, a yearly purchasing contract, a memorandum of understanding and/or a framework agreement. While many of our contractual conditions contained in these agreements are standard, we negotiate with each of our suppliers for any specific terms or conditions that are required. Typical terms of these agreements include terms governing termination, the assignment of contractual rights, payment, rebates and indemnities, the maintenance of stock levels and delivery dates. In limited instances, our suppliers have also committed to repurchase stock from us in certain circumstances, including as a result of changes in our product assortment range. We require that all our suppliers satisfy minimum requirements under our code of conduct and we work with them to ensure that they are fully compliant with our code of conduct. Under our agreements with our suppliers, we may agree to undertake best efforts to meet minimum purchase levels or to purchase a product exclusively from that supplier. In exchange, the supplier typically pays a fee and/or provides stipulated rebates, and must also be a competitive supplier of the product(s) covered in the agreement. We measure a supplier’s competitiveness by benchmarking their performance against their competitors. If a supplier does not meet agreed performance criteria, we have the contractual right to terminate the memorandum of understanding or framework agreement with notice. For some of these agreements, the supplier may have the right to remedy any failure before we can terminate our agreement. We continuously seek to improve and optimize our relationships with suppliers and have for this purpose launched our SITI program during the year ended February 2, 2020. We believe that our SITI program will result in a reduction in stock levels by enhancing auto-replenishment parameters, adapting our seasonal import phasing process, optimizing our ranges, assortment and merchandising rules and by improving our suppliers relationships by introducing a variable margin return on inventory methodology. 112 ----- We continuously seek to improve our buying conditions through direct-sourcing and reductions in our cost-price. For this purpose we have entered into a cooperation agreement for the sourcing and negotiation of supplies of DIY, garden and home improvement products with A.R.E.N.A.

All of the leases that are entered into by Brico and BricoPlanit currently have one or more renewal terms of nine years, and the majority of these leases currently have three renewal terms of nine years. Although we do not have a standard lease for every directly operated store, lease terms are typically ten years in the Netherlands, with a break clause allowing termination of the lease after five years, and nine years in Belgium, although certain exceptional leases in Belgium are as long as 27 years. Annual indexation is in accordance with the applicable consumer price index in the Netherlands and the health index in Belgium.

The entitlement to the bonus depends on whether the net proceeds received by our shareholders in respect of an exit event (which are adjusted upward in relation to the LTIP-related amounts to be paid or payable upon an exit event (the ‘‘Adjusted Proceeds’’)) exceed a threshold, which is automatically increased or decreased in the event of a capital injection by our shareholders or a dividend or prepayment to the shareholders. The LTIP is intended to align the interests of the investors and the eligible participants because any part of the non-cash Adjusted Proceeds will be valued in accordance with the underlying exit event and that, to the extent the payment of a portion of the net proceeds is deferred, a pro rata portion of the bonus will be deferred on the same terms. The amount of the bonus therefore depends on (i) the level of the Adjusted Proceeds and (ii) the time at which the net proceeds of the exit event are received by the Sponsors.

The Guarantors also guarantee our obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain guarantee limitations as set out therein. For the six months ended August 2, 2020, the Guarantors generated 95% and 93% of the Company’s consolidated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and as of August 2, 2020, the Guarantors held 76% of the Company’s consolidated total assets. In addition, as described below ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’ and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility in the future or certain Credit Facilities or Public Debt, in each case of the Company or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, retention of title claims and similar matters. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—Each Guarantee _and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult.’’_ All or substantially all of the operations of the Company will be conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore, the Company depends on the cash flow from its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under its Notes Guarantee. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture.

However, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral only after the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been repaid in full.

Within 60 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the 167 ----- Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Revolving Credit Facility that permits the lenders thereunder to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a_ majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Company (or any Affiliate of the Company) has made an offer to purchase (an ‘‘Alternate Offer’’) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the price that would be required to be paid in a Change of Control Offer and purchases all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer or (iii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under ‘‘—Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such 168 ----- phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Indenture. On the 366th day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds e30.0 million, the Company will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) to all Holders of Notes issued under such Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and to repay, prepay or purchase any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and not more than 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or 185 ----- purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and which may include in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is Public Debt, such higher price as may be contemplated by the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness (provided that such agreement has not been amended or modified to provide for such higher price in connection with such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption), and with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of e100,000 and in integral multiples of e1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 365 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than Euros, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into Euros. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the release of the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are reasonably expected by the Company to be converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (a) e51.0 million and (b) 35.0% of LTM 186 ----- EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. The Revolving Credit Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of participants, who or that in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to 250 ----- pledge such interest to persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving Euroclear and/or Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. United States investors who or that wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Brussels, if Euroclear is used, or in Luxembourg, if Clearstream is used.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

In this ‘‘Description of the _Notes,’’ the term ‘‘Company’’ refers only to Maxeda DIY Holding B.V. and any successor obligor to_ Maxeda DIY Holding B.V. on the Notes, and not to any of its subsidiaries. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under ‘‘—Certain Definitions.’’ The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated as of the Issue Date (the ‘‘Indenture’’), between, inter alios, the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below), U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’), U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent (in such capacity, the ‘‘Security Agent’’) and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, including Section 316(b) of such Act. The Company will use the proceeds of the Notes on or around the Issue Date, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) redeem the Existing Notes in full and (ii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Refinancing Transactions, including the fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the offering of Notes. The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Notes (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’), provided that if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes originally issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code or other identifying number, as applicable, from the Notes originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens.

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. This ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents.

Except for the discussion under ‘‘—Backup withholding and information reporting—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,’’ this summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets by a United States holder (as defined below) who acquires our Notes upon original issuance at their respective issue price (the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the investors for cash (excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler)). As used herein, a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for United States federal income tax purposes any of the following: - an individual citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations (‘‘Treasury Regulations’’) to be treated as a United States person. This summary is based upon provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), and Treasury Regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. Changes in such rules, or new interpretations thereof, may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the United States federal income tax consequences described below. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. A different tax treatment of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes from those discussed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes and does not address the effects of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or foreign, state, or local or other tax considerations including the effects of any United States federal tax laws other than United States federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address: - tax consequences to holders of the Existing Notes; 252 ----- - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark to market method of accounting for their securities, banks, financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies; - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle; - tax consequences to U.S. holders whose ‘‘functional currency’’ is not the United States dollar; - tax consequences to United States expatriates or entities covered by the United States anti-inversion rules; - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an ‘‘applicable financial statement’’ (within the meaning of Section 451 of the Code); or - alternative minimum tax consequences, or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax consequences under Section 59A of the Code. If an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds our Notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Notes, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The ‘‘comparable yield’’ is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.3,Payments of stated interest,62.3.1,,"It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with original issue discount for United States federal income tax purposes. In such a case, subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of interest on a Note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition to interest on the Notes (which includes any foreign tax withheld), you 253 ----- will be required to include in income any Additional Amounts paid in respect of any foreign tax withheld. You may be entitled to deduct or credit this tax, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Stated interest income (including any Additional Amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest (including Additional Amounts) received, determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such stated interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or - the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election. Whether or not such election is made, if you use the accrual method of accounting, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize United States source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment.

Your adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be your U.S. dollar cost for that Note. If you purchased your Note with euro, your cost generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, redeemed, retired or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euro, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. If you are a cash method taxpayer and the Notes are traded on an established securities market, euro paid or received will be translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of 254 ----- Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, derived with respect to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note would generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. A portion of your gain or loss may be treated as exchange gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date you purchased the Note.

Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions), by attaching a complete IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets), with their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest in the Notes. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding backup withholding and information reporting requirements relating to your ownership and disposition of the Notes. _Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_ Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as ‘‘FATCA’’), a ‘‘foreign financial institution’’ may be required to withhold United States tax on certain ‘‘foreign passthru payments’’ made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to 255 ----- certain United States source payments. Under recent U.S. Treasury guidance, such withholding does not apply to any ‘‘foreign passthru payment’’ that is made before the date that is two years after the date on which applicable final U.S. Treasury regulations defining ‘‘foreign passthru payments’’ are issued. Additionally, obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining ‘‘foreign passthru payments’’ are filed generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ unless such obligations are materially modified after such date. As of the date of this offering memorandum, applicable final Treasury Regulations have not yet been filed. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for United States federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Non-United States governments (including the government of the Netherlands) have entered into, and others are expected to enter into, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.

For the purpose of ‘‘—Taxes on income and capital gains,’’ it is assumed that a holder of Notes, being an individual or a non-resident entity, neither has nor will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk _belang), or—in the case of such holder being an entity—a deemed substantial interest, in the Issuer and_ that any connected person (verbonden persoon) to the holder neither has nor will have a substantial interest in the Issuer. Generally speaking, an individual has a substantial interest in a company if (i) such individual, either alone or together with his or her partner, directly or indirectly has, or is deemed to have or (ii) certain relatives of such individual or his or her partner directly or indirectly have or are deemed to have (a) the ownership of, a right to acquire the ownership of, or certain rights over, shares representing 5% or more of either the total issued and outstanding capital of such company or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of such company, or (b) the ownership of, or certain rights over, profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) that relate to 5% or more of either the annual profit or the liquidation proceeds of such company. Generally speaking, a non-resident entity has a substantial interest in a company if such entity, directly or indirectly has (i) the ownership of, a right to acquire the ownership of, or certain rights over, shares representing 5% or more of either the total issued and outstanding capital of such company or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares of such company, or (ii) the ownership of, or certain rights over, profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) that relate to 5% or more of either the annual profit or the liquidation proceeds of such company. Generally, an entity has a deemed substantial interest in a company if such entity has disposed of or is deemed to have disposed of all or part of a substantial interest on a non-recognition basis. For the purpose of this summary, the term ‘‘entity’’ means a corporation as well as any other person that or who is taxable as a corporation for Dutch corporate tax purposes. Where the summary refers to ‘‘the Netherlands’’ or ‘‘Dutch’’ it refers only to the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Where this summary refers to a holder of Notes, an individual holding Notes or an entity holding Notes, such reference is restricted to an individual or entity holding legal title to as well as an economic interest in such Notes or otherwise being regarded as owning Notes for Dutch tax purposes. It is noted that for purposes of Dutch income, corporate, gift and inheritance tax, assets legally owned by a third-party such as a trustee, foundation or similar entity, may be treated as assets owned by the 256 ----- (deemed) settlor, grantor or similar originator or the beneficiaries in proportion to their interest in such arrangement.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the Offering’s price for each series of Notes and any other selling terms without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through United Statesregistered broker dealers. ING Bank N.V., London Branch, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and BNP Paribas, are not registered broker-dealers in the United States, and therefore, to the extent that they intend to effect any offers or sales of the Notes in the United States, they will do so through their respective affiliates ING Financial Markets LLC, ABN AMRO Securities (USA) LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp. or any other U.S. registered broker-dealers pursuant to applicable U.S. securities laws. In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that: - the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the relevant Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain opinions by their counsel; - during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 45 days after such date, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their subsidiaries or other affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs International, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt (including, without limitation, any debt securities, loans or other debt instruments), issued or guaranteed by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Notes); and - the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and/or will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the issue price set forth on the cover page hereof. Certain affiliates of the Issuer may purchase a portion of the Notes in the Offering. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the commencement of the Offering and (ii) the Issue Date, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. During this 40-day period, neither Clearstream nor Euroclear will monitor compliance by dealers with Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act. The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions.’’ We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market-making in the Notes at any 259 ----- time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate-covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate-covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicatecovering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T+ ‘‘). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next successive business day will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing should consult their own advisor. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of Notes. See ‘‘Notice to Certain Investors.’’ Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have arranged and made loans to the Issuer in the past and received fees in relation to arranging such loans. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates from time to time have performed, and in the future will perform, banking, investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Issuer and its affiliates, for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement of expenses. In particular, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into 260 ----- transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of the Issuer, the group, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. 261 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

The below guidance as to centre of main interests and any cross-border proceedings within the EU should be construed as a description of the current law as at the date of this offering memorandum. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ (which according to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation is ‘‘the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties’’) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its centre of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the centre of main interests ‘‘shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties.’’ The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the centre of main interests of a debtor, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption should be rebutted where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A debtor’s centre of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If the centre of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean ‘‘any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.’’ Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another EU Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such EU Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. 262 ----- The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its centre of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s centre of main interests is situated under of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of our group’s members. _Effects of EU Directive 2019/1023 on Restructuring and Insolvency_ On July 16, 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019, on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (‘‘EU Restructuring Directive’’) entered into force. The Member States are required to pass national laws to implement the directive by July 17, 2021, at the latest. The EU Restructuring Directive aims to harmonize the laws and procedures of Member States concerning preventive restructurings and insolvencies, to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the EU Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The EU Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the Member States (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the EU Restructuring Directive need to be transposed into national legislation, the EU Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion regarding the implementation of certain other features. In particular, when implementing the EU Restructuring Directive, Member States must ensure that, under their national laws, companies will have access to a pre-insolvency restructuring framework which permits a haircut of debt and other restructuring measures on the basis of a majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of claims in each class and where applicable a majority by numbers (meaning, for instance, that an opposing creditor can be outvoted by the majority). The EU Restructuring Directive also provides for cross-class cramdown, i.e., even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the EU Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be transposed into national legislation. The implementation of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new financing. Although the EU Restructuring Directive also foresees a number of safeguards protecting creditors from abuse and although it is not clear how exactly the EU Restructuring Directive will be implemented in individual Member States, the current domestic insolvency law of some Member States may change substantially if they lack any of the mechanisms that the EU Restructuring 263 ----- Directive will make mandatory. This might have considerable repercussions for the position of creditors of a Member State legal entity. The description of the current Member State domestic insolvency regimes must, therefore, be read with the understanding that they might change substantially.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

This also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is the territory in which the center of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows secondary insolvency proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets situated in Belgium of companies that are not established under Belgian law. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings are restricted to the assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the context of the present transaction. Belgian insolvency laws provide for two types of insolvency proceedings: judicial reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/r´eorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy proceedings (faillissement/faillite).

Book XX of the Code of Economic Law provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors, (ii) a collective agreement, or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and/or third parties.

The contents of this principle are broad and are defined in practice by the courts. If the net assets of the company have fallen below 50% of the company’s registered capital (kapitaal/capital), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. The court may accept a petition for judicial reorganization in other circumstances; for instance, if the activity of the company may be hampered or shut down by creditors. The fact that the conditions for bankruptcy are met (entailing that the debtor has the legal obligation to declare bankruptcy pursuant to Article XX.102 of Book XX of the Code of Economic Law), does not preclude the debtor from applying for judicial reorganization. The petition for judicial reorganization must indicate the measures and proposals that will be taken or made by the debtor to carry out the reorganization. A number of documents must also be attached to the petition, including, but not limited to, an interim balance sheet and income 264 ----- statement, prepared under the supervision of an auditor, an external expert accountant or a certified tax accountant. As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, subject to certain exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets, unless (in the case of movable assets) the scheduled date for the forced sale of the relevant movable assets falls within two months from the filing of the request for judicial reorganization and such forced sale is not suspended by the court. The filing of the petition does not, however, have a suspensory effect if the debtor had previously already requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings (this is less than six months before), except if the court decides otherwise. Book XX of the Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court will hear the debtor and/or their lawyer on the petition for reorganization and will hear the report from the delegated judge. After this hearing, the court will rule within eight days on the petition for judicial reorganization. If the conditions for judicial reorganization appear to be met, and all required documents have been provided, the court will declare that the judicial reorganization proceedings are open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended (once or several times), but cannot exceed twelve months in total (or, in exceptional circumstances, such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment, and in the interest of the creditors, eighteen months).",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against the debtor’s assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, subject to certain exceptions (see below), and, except for forced sales, the scheduled date that falls within two months from the filing of the request for judicial reorganization provided that this has not been suspended by the court. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt (except upon declaration of the debtor itself) and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial dissolution will not be possible during this period. Conservatory attachments/seizures that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization proceedings, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created; hence the holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. Receivables that form part of a pledge over business assets do not benefit from such exemption. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law of December 15, 2004 (Wet Financi¨ele Zekerheden/Loi sur les Sˆuret´es Financi`eres) (the ‘‘Belgian Law on Financial Collateral’’), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantors, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on cash held on accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a company mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/m´ediateur d’entreprise) to the extent it is deemed useful for reaching the aims of the restructuring. Furthermore, the court may appoint, in its decision to open the judicial reorganization proceedings or at any other point in time during the course of the procedure, a judicial 265 ----- administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) to assist the debtor during the restructuring. The court may also appoint a judicial administrator, upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings or bad faith of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies insofar as such measure can safeguard the continuity of the debtor for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross error (kennelijk grove fout/faute grave et _caract´eris´ee), the court may, upon the request of any interested party or the prosecutor, appoint a_ temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) replacing the debtor’s corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium and charged with the management of the debtor. Furthermore, upon the request of any interested party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company loses all or part of the management or all or part of its assets or activities in case of important, precise and consistent indications (gewichtige, bepaalde en met elkaar overeenstemmende _aanwijzingen/indices graves, pr´ecis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are met._ The reorganization proceedings aim to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the judicial reorganization procedure does not terminate any contracts. Since the Act of May 27, 2013, modifying the former 2009 Act on the Continuity of Enterprises (which has in the meantime been replaced by Title V of Book XX of the Code of Economic Law) the delegated judge, appointed to assist the debtor in the realization of the reorganization, has additional powers and can for instance require the court to end the reorganization prematurely when they consider that the debtor is clearly not in state to ensure the continuity of the whole or part of their business. Contractual provisions that provide for the early termination or the acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Moreover, Title V of Book XX of the Code of Economic Law provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. In this case, the relevant creditor has the right to suspend the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the performance of its own obligations. Judicial reorganization proceedings may result in an amicable settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors, a collective agreement or a transfer of (part of) its activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and all parties involved.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure or definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame. In addition, the court can at any moment, in the case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor or the creditor its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of new information. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. 266 ----- The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator or company mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/m´ediateur d’entreprise), as the case may be. The plan may include measures, such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity, and may be based on a limited (justified) differentiated treatment for certain various categories of liabilities. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity (Book XX of the Code of Economic Law contains certain limitations, primarily in view of protecting employees of the debtor) and may be based on a differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. It must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar association (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote. The reorganization plan can bind creditors who have a contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees, mortgagees and the so-called creditor-owners, provided that (i) interest is paid on the principal amount of their outstanding debts, and (ii) their rights are not suspended for more than 24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by the court.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets (if there are strong indications that the conditions for bankruptcy are met), by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ opened in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened in respect of any ‘‘enterprise’’ as defined by Article I.1, 1� of the Code of Economic Law (which includes, among others, any legal person, other than 267 ----- certain public law entities). Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/d´eclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze _opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de paiements de mani`ere persistante) and be unable to obtain_ further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/´ebranlement de cr´edit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. The mere fact that a debtor has more debts than assets does not necessarily mean that the bankruptcy conditions are met. Companies whose liquidation has been started can be declared bankrupt up to six months after the judgments of the closing of the liquidation. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the bankruptcy receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court, or may request the temporary continued operation of the business. The bankruptcy receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may decide not to continue the performance of one or several ongoing contracts, subject to certain limitations, according to case law. The counterparty to an ongoing contract may summon the bankruptcy receiver to take a decision within 15 days. If no extension of the 15-day term is agreed upon or if the bankruptcy receiver does not make any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15-day term. If the bankruptcy receiver decides not to continue the performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the 15-day term, the counterparty to the contract may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy, in which case such claim will rank _pari passu with the claims of all other unsecured creditors, and/or seek a court order to have the relevant_ contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract. The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. Two exceptions apply, however: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the counterparty constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can however agree to continue to perform under such contracts. As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy receiver may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does in principle not apply to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Law on Financial Collateral. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate credits (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse). For creditors whose claims are secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension would normally be limited to the period required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended by a court order for up to one year as from the bankruptcy judgment, provided that such extension is in the interests of the bankruptcy estate and if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudice to the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period. If a security, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings. 268 ----- As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax debts or social security debts. The ranking of different types of debt of the bankrupt debtor is determined on the basis of a complex set of rules. The following is a general overview of only the main principles: - Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the bankruptcy receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the ‘‘estate debts,’’ which have a senior priority. In addition, if the bankruptcy receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the bankruptcy receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. Tax and social security claims incurred during the judicial reorganization proceedings will be preferential debts of the estate in a subsequent liquidation or bankruptcy. - Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization). - Privileges/liens: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests. - Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the bankruptcy receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated). - Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Corporate benefit is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue. If the granting of a guarantee or the creation of a security interest does not fall within the grantor’s corporate object or purpose, then such guarantee or security interest could, upon certain conditions, be held null and void. The assessment of whether or not the grant of a guarantee or security interest is in a Belgian company’s corporate benefit is largely dependent on factual considerations and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the (board of) directors of that Belgian company at the time of the granting of the guarantee or security interest(s), and can be reviewed on a case-by-case basis at the time of the enforcement by the competent courts. Consideration has to be given to any actual or real benefit (be it direct or indirect) that the company would actually derive from the transaction; this is particularly relevant for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and security interests. Among others, it is generally considered by legal scholars that at least the following principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the Belgian Guarantor in issuing the guarantee must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction; and (ii) the financial assistance granted by the Belgian Guarantor should not exceed its financial capabilities. The responsibility for such assessment is of the (board of) directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s management will be subject to only a ‘‘marginal review’’ by the courts. In insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a more critical view. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the (board of) directors of the company may be held liable under civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as ‘‘abuse of company goods’’ (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien _sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain_ circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or collateral could be held liable on the basis of the principles of tort liability. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an 269 ----- amount corresponding to the corporate benefit and, under certain circumstances, the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture and the security documents (if relevant) will contain such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor(s) and the security will be so limited. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or upholding the corporate benefit. In particular, pursuant to such limitation language, the obligations of any Belgian Guarantor under the Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall be limited, at any time, to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of: (1) 80 per cent. of the Net Assets of the relevant Belgian Guarantor calculated on the basis of the latest available audited annual accounts at the date hereof; (2) 80 per cent. of the Net Assets of the relevant Belgian Guarantor calculated on the basis of the latest audited annual accounts available at the date on which the relevant demand is made; and (3) the highest level of On-Lending to the relevant Belgian Guarantor reached at any time between the date of the Indenture and the date on which a demand is made under the Guarantee. Whereby: ‘‘Net Assets’’ (nettoactief) has the meaning given to it in Article 5:142 or 7:212 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, as applicable, less the aggregate amount of the relevant Belgian Guarantor’s receivables (vorderingen) against other obligors, it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that any balance standing to the credit of account (rekening courant) held by the relevant Belgian Guarantor and any other obligor shall be deemed to constitute a receivable for this purpose and, in the event of a dispute on the amount thereof, a certificate of such amount from the statutory auditors of the relevant Belgian Guarantor (or, if none, an independent firm of accountants of international repute) shall be conclusive; and ‘‘On-Lending’’ means the aggregate amount of all utilizations drawn or borrowings by any other obligor under the Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and made available, directly or indirectly, to the relevant Belgian Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the ‘‘hardening period’’. The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against third parties and are unenforceable against the bankruptcy receiver include, among others: (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into without consideration or where the consideration received is considerably below the value of the act or asset provided by the debtor; (ii) payments for debts that are not yet due; (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due; and (iv) new security provided for pre-existing debts (save for any security granted during the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of debts arising before the opening of the proceedings or under or in connection with an out-of-court settlement with creditors entered into as part of the proceedings). Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties, provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment. In particular, a guarantee entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously or where the consideration received is considerably below the value of the guarantee provided or (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee were aware of the company’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure pre-existing debts. If the Guarantee given by the Belgian Guarantor was successfully voided (based on the above), holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and would be under an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such Guarantee. Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third-party creditor may obtain a court ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio pauliana). Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be declared ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed and the date of registration.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

This is particularly relevant to the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors which are incorporated in the Netherlands (the ‘‘Dutch Guarantors’’) and which are therefore presumed (subject to proof to the contrary and exceptions provided for in the EU Insolvency Regulation) to have their ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in the Netherlands. See ‘‘—European Union.’’ Dutch insolvency laws differ significantly from insolvency proceedings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and may make it more difficult for you to recover the amount you would normally expect to recover in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. or another jurisdiction. There are circumstances under Dutch insolvency law in which the granting by a Dutch Guarantor of security and guarantees can be challenged. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws. Any insolvency proceedings applicable to the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors may be governed by Dutch insolvency laws. There are two insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, a suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e. more than one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de _macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset._ Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its general meeting to file an application for its own bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, can benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately from bankruptcy and do not have to 272 ----- contribute to the liquidation costs; however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (i) a statutory stay of execution of up to two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight months if the similar statutory stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (referred to above) is first applied during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (ii) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (iii) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor. Both a suspension of payments and bankruptcy have retroactive effect from 00.00 hours of the day on which the suspension of payments or the bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch company is declared. Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under United States bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, a suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings against Dutch debtors would allow secured creditors (and in the case of suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution as described above may be ordered by the competent court both in a suspension of payments and bankruptcy. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s debtor’s assets. Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights, as described above, may be imposed. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for the set-off. Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when a suspension of payments is granted, and will terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted; and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared. All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, entitled to distributions. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition, a claim that has not been submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. ‘‘Verification’’ under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver for verification, and the receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether and to what extent it 273 ----- should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors who wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while in a suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a United States liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed. Interest on claims accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the Notes. To the extent that interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. _The Dutch Scheme_ On May 26, 2020 the Dutch House of Representatives (Tweede Kamer) adopted the Act on confirmation of private restructuring plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord (‘‘WHOA’’)), which will now be put to the vote in the Dutch Senate (Eerste Kamer). The WHOA implements into national law the EU Restructuring Directive discussed above under ‘‘—European Union—Effects of EU Directive _2019/1023 on Restructuring and Insolvency.’’ The WHOA, which is scheduled to enter into force prior to_ January 1, 2021, and is inspired by US Chapter 11 proceedings and UK Schemes of Arrangement, and will introduce a framework allowing debtors to restructure their debts outside of formal insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘Dutch Scheme’’). The Dutch Scheme provides, inter alia, that a restructuring plan in respect of a certain class of creditors shall be approved and ratified by the courts (gehomologeerd) in the event that two-third of the value of the amount of claims held by creditors in that class vote in favor of such restructuring plan (unless the scheme rules have not been complied with). Furthermore, a restructuring plan can be proposed to multiple classes of creditors, including classes of secured creditors, at the same time. If at least one eligible class of creditors has voted in favor of the restructuring plan, the debtor or, if appointed, a restructuring expert, can request the court to approve the plan and bind all classes. This system of cross-class cramdown of dissenting creditors is subject to a number of protective rules, including the right for a court to refuse confirmation of a composition plan if such plan does not meet the ‘‘best interests of creditors test’’. _Proposed emergency legislation to protect enterprises in financial distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic_ On September 3, 2020, the Dutch legislature proposed emergency legislation regarding a temporary suspension of enforcement and other measures in support of enterprises during the COVID-19 crisis (Tijdelijke wet COVID-19 SZW en JenV). As drafted, the proposed legislation provides for a court-ordered moratorium and several related protections which apply until December 1, 2020 and can, if and when necessary, be extended beyond that date for two-month periods at a time. At this time, it is not yet known when the proposed legislation will enter into force. The measures of the proposed legislation apply to enterprises (other than regulated entities) whose continuity is threatened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors (other than the Tax authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or seizure of assets, the enterprise/debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis-`a-vis those creditors of two months (which may be extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by two-month periods at a time), and if such moratorium is granted by the court then during such period: (i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed; (ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of itself, provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an agreement with those creditors; and (iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are suspended, and no other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors against the assets of their debtor without the prior approval of the court. The measures referred to in (iii) can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can be terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that as currently proposed, any measure of the court only affects those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution 274 ----- or seizure of assets of the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the same decisions. When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish that the enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID-19-virus, the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall due. Creditors not covered by the moratorium retain these rights vis-`a-vis their debtor. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to be in this position if it can provide financial information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19-virus or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared to the average revenue in the preceding three months. The court will further need to conclude that following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s) that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of the moratorium. When granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.

Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or security interest should be voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include rights of suspension (opschorting), a dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set-off (verrekening). The enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act (Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation, enforcement and collection costs. Until the legislation that is referred to above under ‘‘—Proposed Emergency Legislation to Protect _Enterprises in Financial Distress due to the COVID-19 Pandemic’’ enters into force, and where applicable_ in addition thereto, all actions described in the preceding paragraph are still available to be pursued and have been left to the parties themselves to determine as necessary, under the guidance of general civil law principles on reasonableness and fairness, unforeseen circumstances and the other principles set out above. However, guidelines issued by the Dutch courts provide that applications in insolvency and attachment matters (which may include enforcement of security) should clearly state whether, and how, the matters addressed in the relevant court petition are related to the COVID-19 pandemic and indicate that the Dutch courts will, on the relevant petition, consider all relevant circumstances to determine whether the filing constitutes an abuse of the current situation, which expressly includes the consideration of the impact of COVID-19. Furthermore, any enforcement action or court process may face delays or other practical challenges in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, if a Dutch Guarantor enters into a transaction (such as the granting of a guarantee or security interest), the validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be contested by the Dutch company or its administrator in a suspension of payments or its receiver in bankruptcy, if both (i) the obligations of the company under that transaction is not in the company’s corporate interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and (ii) the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation. In determining whether the granting of a guarantee or the giving of security is in the interest of the relevant Dutch company, a Dutch court would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the company but also all relevant circumstances, including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and any indirect benefit derived by the relevant Dutch company as a consequence of the interdependence of it with the group of companies to which it belongs and whether or not the subsistence of the relevant Dutch company is jeopardized by conducting such transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in the objects clause in the articles of association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such legal act is in its corporate interest. 275 ----- As of October 1, 2012, the prohibition on financial assistance for a Dutch private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) was removed from Dutch law. In connection with such removal the legislator noted that the granting of security with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra vires act. At present, there is no Dutch case law on this subject.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Under Dutch law, any creditor of a Dutch Guarantor (outside bankruptcy) (or its administrator or receiver (in bankruptcy) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes (including the granting of the Guarantee or any security), under certain circumstances, if (i) the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes was conducted without a prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its or their bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions); and (iii) at the time of the transaction or legal act entered into by a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes was conducted (including the granting of the Guarantee or any security), the relevant Dutch Guarantor and, unless the transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). A receiver may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the above-mentioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is, however, presumed by law for certain transactions performed within a ‘‘suspect period’’ of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty in order to give preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful. The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral will not prevent effect being given to the overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the situation has a close connection (and for this purpose ‘‘overriding provisions’’ are provisions the respect for which are regarded as crucial by a jurisdiction for safeguarding its public interests to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to an agreement and include any rules (whether mandatory or not) that must be applied pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation) and will not prevent regard having to be had to the law of the jurisdiction in which performance takes place in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance. In addition, enforcement of each Dutch law security interest in the Collateral (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Among other things, under Dutch law shares may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of association of the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement. Rights of third parties acquiring a share or a limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder trouw) may also affect the binding effect and enforceability of a Dutch law security interest in the Collateral. In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public auction of the relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law. The Security Agent or the relevant security interest provider may request the competent court to approve a private sale of the secured assets, except when otherwise agreed. In the case of secured assets, the Security Agent and the security interest provider may agree to an alternative foreclosure procedure once the security right has become 276 ----- enforceable. The security interest providers have agreed to waive the right to request such alternative foreclosure procedure. The Security Agent may also request the competent court to determine that the secured assets shall accrue to it for a price determined by the court. In the case of a pledge, the right of the relevant security interest provider to request approval of a private sale may be excluded. It is not certain because it has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the documentation relating to the Notes will provide for the creation of a ‘‘parallel debt.’’ Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes.

However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, and notably if: - the rights of defense have been violated; - such recognition or enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with Belgian public policy; - the decision is not final and may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement could then be granted) or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable laws; - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian private international law; - the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter; - the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium; - Belgian jurisdictions had exclusive jurisdiction in respect of that matter; - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was exclusively based on the presence of the defendant or assets without any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state; or - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing. As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex _fori). In Belgium the procedural rules contained in, amongst others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the_ Belgian Code of Private International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by United States courts is sought in Belgium. In the case of an enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of foreign court decisions in Belgium), a registration duty at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is payable by the debtor if the sum of money that the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court, or by a foreign court judgment that is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds e12,500. A nominal registration tax would be due on the registration of bailiff deeds. 284 ----- The Belgian Code of Private International Law contains specific rules for the enforcement of judgements that relate to insolvency matters.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,27,LEGAL MATTERS,27.2,The Netherlands,27.2.1,,"The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain United States court judgments in the Netherlands is based upon advice provided to us by our Dutch legal advisors. The Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors. The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment that is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be relitigated before a competent Dutch court and the judgment rendered by the foreign court must be submitted in the course of such proceedings, in which case the Dutch court will have to decide whether and to what extent it, given the circumstances of the case, will recognize the foreign judgment. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation analysis on the merits if (i) the foreign court rendering that judgment has jurisdiction over the matter on internationally acceptable grounds and has conducted the proceedings in accordance with generally accepted principles of fair trial, (ii) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (iii) the foreign judgment is not in conflict with a decision rendered by a Dutch court between the same parties, or with an earlier judgment rendered by a foreign court in proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision can be recognized in the Netherlands, and (iv) the foreign judgment is—according to the law of its country of origin—final and conclusive in such a way that all appeals have been exhausted and no other remedy could be obtained from a competent judicial body. Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties, investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from United States federal or state courts. Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a United States court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. The enforcement and recognition of judgments of United States courts in the Netherlands are subject to the Dutch rules of civil procedure. Subject to the foregoing and service of process in accordance with applicable treaties, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from United States federal or state courts may be enforceable in the Netherlands. No assurance can be given, however, that these judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws. 285 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Basis of preparation (Continued) Significant changes in the current reporting period: Covid-19,1280.17.1,,"The Covid-19 pandemic affected the Company’s results, balance sheet and cash flows presented in these semi-annual condensed consolidated financial statements. The impact of the pandemic upon application of the Company accounting policies is disclosed below. The preparation of these interim financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. The Company regularly updates its significant assumptions and estimates. The estimates, assumptions and judgments that management considers most critical are disclosed on page 7. In relation to this, Covid-19 primarily impacted the following areas. _Impairments_ Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit or asset may be impaired. During the six months ended August 2, 2020 a net cash inflow of e146 million was generated compared with a net cash outflow of e27 million for the same period the previous year. Notwithstanding the impact of Covid-19 the Company’s performance in the six months ended August 2, 2020 has been better than budget and therefore the Company did not identify any impairment triggers. Consequently the Company did not perform an impairment test. _Going concern_ Although the demand from customers is above expectations, the future impact on our business is hard to predict. At the date of this report, the crisis is still evolving, bringing many uncertainties, which make it impossible to predict the scale of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the Company and its future including our operations, financial performance and liquidity. It is becoming clear that the outbreak has serious negative global implications which could result in a recession to which the organization may have to adapt. Various scenarios are possible with no consensus on how recovery will actually evolve, when the direct impact will end and how the economy will recover. Based on our current best estimates the Company will not have a cash shortage over a period of at least twelve months starting from August 2, 2020. As a result no additional funding is needed and sufficient headroom is maintained under the financial covenant of the RCF. Consequently, based on current information, we have sufficient access to financing and loan covenants are expected to continue to be complied with over a period of at least twelve months starting from August 2, 2020, so we do not foresee impact on our ability to continue as a going concern. _Pension obligations_ The Company’s pension provisions are impacted by the increased economic uncertainty and related risks. In 2020, most discount rates used to discount the pension obligations dropped compared to 2019. The impact of the lower discount rates has been reflected in the six months period ended August 2, 2020. _Income taxes_ Covid-19 and the resulting changes in the economic environment did not result in changes to whether deferred tax assets are (un)realizable and, therefore, do not lead to changes in the balance sheet.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire, or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party and does not retain control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Purchases and sales of financial assets in the normal course of business are accounted for at settlement date (i.e., the date that the asset is delivered to or by the Group). At initial recognition, the Group measures its financial assets at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. After initial recognition, the Group classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at either i) amortized cost, ii) fair value through other comprehensive income or iii) fair value through profit or loss on the basis of both: - The Group’s business model for managing the financial assets - The contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets are measured as described below. At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses for financial assets measured at either amortized costs or at fair value through other comprehensive income. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 months of expected credit losses. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for the financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

When financial liabilities are initially recognized, they are generally measured at their fair value. An exception to this policy is made for the measurement of financial liabilities ‘‘not at fair value through profit and loss’’, which are measured at their fair value plus direct transaction costs. The Group classifies all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference between the proceeds and redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the period of the loans and short-term borrowings using the effective interest method.

Belgium has closed the stores as per March 18, 2020 and re-opened them as per April 18, 2020 and in the Netherlands stricter rules are applicable for store visiting. Consequently, revenue has been decreased for a period of time in Belgium.

At the date of this Annual report, the crisis is still evolving, bringing many uncertainties, which make it impossible to predict the scale of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on Maxeda and its future including our operations, financial performance and liquidity.

IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets when such recognition exemptions are adopted. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. Details of these new requirements are described in Note 3. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the Group’s consolidated financial statements is described below. The date of initial application of IFRS 16 for the Group is February 4, 2019. The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up approach under IFRS 16: - Requires the Group to recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application; and - Does not permit restatement of comparatives, which continue to be presented under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (Continued)",1280.71.1,,"The change in definition of a lease mainly relates to the concept of control. IFRS 16 determines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This is in contrast to the focus on ‘risks and rewards’ in IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The Group applies the definition of a lease and related guidance set out in IFRS 16 to all lease contracts entered into or changed on or after February 4, 2019 (whether it is a lessor or a lessee in the lease contract). In preparation for the first-time application of IFRS 16, the Group has carried out an implementation project. The project has shown that the new definition in IFRS 16 will not significantly change the scope of contracts that meet the definition of a lease for the Group. However, IFRS 16 has changed and expanded the disclosures required, in particular regarding how a lessor manages the risks arising from its residual interest in leased assets. Under IFRS 16, an intermediate lessor accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The intermediate lessor is required to classify the sublease as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease (and not by reference to the underlying asset as was the case under IAS 17). Because of this change, the Group has reclassified certain of its operating sublease agreements as finance leases and accounted for them as new finance leases entered into at the date of initial application. IFRS 9 requires to recognize an allowance for expected credit losses on the finance lease receivables. The Group has estimated that no such allowance was necessary on the current sublease portfolio.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464
164_1,Offerings 2020.md,1280,MAXEDA DIY GROUP B.V.,1280.72,(b)** **Impact on Lessee Accounting,1280.72.1,,"IFRS 16 changes how the Group accounts for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, which were off balance sheet. Applying IFRS 16, for all leases (except as noted below), the Group: a) Recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments in accordance with IFRS 16:C8(b)(ii); b) Recognizes depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the consolidated statement of profit or loss; c) Separates the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest (presented within financing activities) in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Lease incentives (e.g. rent free period) are recognised as part of the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities whereas under IAS 17 they resulted in the recognition of a lease incentive, amortized as a reduction of rental expenses on a straight line basis. Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. For short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (e.g. advertising materials, printers and coffee machines), the Group has opted to recognize a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16. The Group has used the following practical expedients when applying the cumulative catch-up approach to leases previously classified as operating leases applying IAS 17. - The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities to leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application; - The Group has excluded low-value assets below $ 5.000; - The Group has excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; - The Group has used hindsight when determining the lease term when the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; - Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. an operation, the goodwill attributable to that operation is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal. Other intangible assets, tangible assets and financial assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment assessments, assets are divided into groups with separately identifiable cash flows. Individual stores are considered to be separate groups of cash-generating units for impairment testing purposes. Financial assets are assessed for impairment on an investment-by-investment basis. When an impairment is identified, the carrying value of the assets is written-down to their recoverable amount. The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: - The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate. - The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using an unchanged discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used). - A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification. The Group did not make any such adjustments during the periods presented. The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under IAS 37. To the extent that the costs relate to a right-of-use asset, the costs are included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease. The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ policy. Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. For a contract that contain a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. _The Group as lessor_ The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its investment properties. F-30 ----- Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (such as tablets and personal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones). For these leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee uses its incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: - Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; - Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; - The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and - Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease.

The benefits of this fiscal unity structure are attributed pro rata to the companies within the fiscal unity. Over the reporting period the fiscal unity was in a tax loss position. As the fiscal unity as a total was in a tax loss position, no deferred tax asset/liability was recorded. In relation to the available tax losses of the Dutch fiscal unity, management determined that based on current expectations it is more likely than not that these losses cannot be used in the foreseeable future. As such no deferred tax asset for loss compensation was recorded for the Dutch operations. The unrecognised tax losses of this fiscal unity expire in 2020/21 and subsequent years. In relation to the available tax losses for the Belgian companies, management determined that based on current expectations it is more likely than not that these losses cannot be used in the foreseeable future (with the exception of the loss of Brico Plan-It of current fiscal year that could be compensated in fiscal year 2020/21). The losses of the Belgian companies are not subject to any expiry date. F-38 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Key assumptions used in the impairment tests for the group of cash-generating units are sales growth rates, gross profit (margin) and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. The cash flow projections are based on the Group’s strategic plan. The Group adapted the future benefits projection from 5 to 3 years which is aligned with the strategic plan 2020-2022 for Maxeda DIY Group B.V. For estimation of the terminal value, we utilized a long-term growth rate of 1,5% for both group of cash generating units, based on expected long-term inflation rates. The present value of estimated future cash flows has been calculated using a post-tax discount rate of 7,3% and 8,2% for respectively DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium (2018/19: 8,5% for DIY the Netherlands and 9,5% for DIY Belgium). The post-tax discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks of the group of cash generating unit. The pre-tax discount rate is equal to 10,3% and 12,3% for respectively DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium. The outcome of a sensitivity analysis of a 100 basis point adverse change in key assumptions (lower growth rates or higher discount rates respectively) did not result in a materially different outcome of the impairment test for both DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium. Key assumptions in the cashflow projections are: - Growth rate aligned with HICP rate issued by the European Central Bank; and - WACC falls in the benchmark of comparable peer enterprises.

The plan is final-pay based and is administrated by an insurance company. The pension plans expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: longevity risk, interest rate risk, salary risk and investment risk. Longevity risk relates to the mortality assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation where an increase in participants’ life expectancies will increase a plan’s liability. Interest rate risk relates to the discount rate used to value the defined benefit obligation where a decrease in the discount rate will increase a plan’s liability, however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on a plan’s investments in debt instruments. Salary risk relates to salary increase assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation, where an increase will result in a higher plan liability. The average duration of the defined benefit obligations of the plans is 10 years. During the year no amendments/curtailments or settlements have been made. The plans are insured and funded via insurance premiums calculated by the insurer. The future return of the assets effects the future contributions. Any shortfall under legal minimum funding requirements should be funded immediately. The Defined Benefit Obligation is computed in accordance with IAS 19; this quantity is the discounted present value of all benefits attributed under the Cost Method to service rendered prior to the fiscal date. The calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The Group contributed e 4 million (2018/19: e 5 million) to its defined benefit plans recorded.

The sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than an operating segment. Groups of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the groups of cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. On partial or complete disposal of an operation, the goodwill attributable to that operation is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal. Other intangible assets, tangible assets and financial assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment assessments, assets are divided into groups with separately identifiable cash flows. Individual stores are considered to be separate groups of cash-generating units for impairment testing purposes. Financial assets are assessed for impairment on an investment-by-investment basis. When an impairment is identified, the carrying value of the assets is written-down to their recoverable amount.

Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

Furthermore, the Board of Directors is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

F-65 ----- Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.: - Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. - Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. - Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures. - Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our audit. We provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (Continued)",1281.15.1,,"IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their treatment in the financial statements for both lessors and lessees. IFRS 16 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and the related Interpretations when it becomes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The date of initial application of IFRS 16 for the Group will be February 1, 2019. For adopting IFRS 16, the Group elected to apply the modified retrospective approach whereby comparative information is not restated. The Group will make use of the practical expedient available on transition to IFRS 16 not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered or modified before the date of initial application. The change in definition of a lease mainly relates to the concept of control. IFRS 16 distinguishes between leases and service contracts on the basis of whether the use of an identified asset is controlled by the Group. Control is considered to exist if the Group has: - The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset; and - The right to direct the use of that asset. The Group will apply the definition of a lease and related guidance set out in IFRS 16 to all lease contracts entered into or modified on or after February 1, 2019 (whether it is a lessor or a lessee in the lease contract). In preparation for the firsttime application of IFRS 16, the Group has carried out an implementation project. The project has shown that the new definition in IFRS 16 will not change significantly the scope of contracts that meet the definition of a lease for the Group. As at February 1, 2019, the Group’s lease portfolio consists of retail stores (located in Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) from which it conducts business and lease vehicles used to transport goods and employees. The (remaining) lease terms of retail stores at the date of initial application, varies between 1-45 years. IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of the lease plus periods covered by an option to extend or an option to terminate if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the extension option or not exercise the termination option. At the date of initial application, the Group assessed the options to extend or options to terminate leases based on the performance of the retail stores and Group’s strategic planning and has taken this into account when determining the (remaining) lease term. The lease terms of vehicles varies between 1-6 years. There are no options included in the agreements to extend or to terminate the lease term. On initial application of IFRS 16, the Group will recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset in the statement of financial position. The lease liability will be measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. Lease incentives (e.g. rent-free period) will be recognized as part of the measurement of the rightof-use assets and lease liabilities whereas under IAS 17 they resulted in the recognition of a lease liability incentive, amortized as a reduction of rental expenses on a straight-line basis. Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. This will replace the previous requirement to recognize a provision for onerous lease contracts. For short-term leases (remaining lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (e.g. advertising materials, printers and coffee machines), the Group will opt to recognize a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16. As at February 1, 2019, the estimated impact for the Group is e 555 million for the right-of-use asset and a corresponding estimation of e 605 million on lease liabilities based on a discount rate varying F-74 ----- between 1,97% and 6,24%. The discount rate applied reflects the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to purchase an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Under IFRS 16, a lessor continues to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account for those two types of leases differently. However, IFRS 16 has changed and expanded the disclosures required, in particular regarding how a lessor manages the risks arising from its residual interest in leased assets. Furthermore under IFRS 16, an intermediate lessor accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The intermediate lessor is required to classify the sublease as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease (and not by reference to the underlying asset as was the case under IAS 17). Due to this change, the Group classifies its subleases as finance leases, which will result in the recognition of an asset relating to finance leases amounting to an estimate of e 50 million.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

For 2018/19 this effect resulted in a reporting period of 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2019 including reported revenues and cost of sales up to that date. The comparative information covers a reporting period of 52 weeks. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in IAS 2 or value in use in IAS 36 and IAS 19 employee benefits. In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; F-75 ----- The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below.

Other intangible assets Other intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Key assumptions used in the impairment tests for the group of cash-generating units are sales growth rates, gross profit (margin) and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. The cash flow projections are based on the Company’s strategic plan. For estimation of the terminal value, we utilized a long-term growth rate of 1.5% for both group of cash generating units, based on expected long-term inflation rates. The present value of estimated future cash flows has been calculated using a post-tax discount rate of 9.2% and 10.0% for respectively DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium (2016/17: 10.0% for both countries). The post-tax discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks of the group of cash generating unit. The pre-tax discount rate is equal to 11.9% and 13.0% for respectively DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium. The outcome of a sensitivity analysis of a 100 basis point adverse change in key assumptions (lower growth rates or higher discount rates respectively) did not result in a materially different outcome of the impairment test for both DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being low value and high volumes. Accordingly, management believes that no further credit allowance is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

Key assumptions used in the impairment tests for the group of cash-generating units are sales growth rates, gross profit (margin) and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. The cash flow projections are based on the Company’s strategic plan. The Company extended the future benefits projection from 3 to 5 years which is aligned with the strategic plan 2019-2023 for Maxeda DIY Group B.V.. For estimation of the terminal value, we utilized a long-term growth rate of 1,5% for both group of cash generating units, based on expected long-term inflation rates. The present value of estimated future cash flows has been calculated using a post-tax discount rate of 8,5% and 9,5% for respectively DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium (2017/18: 9,2% for DIY the Netherlands and 10,0% for DIY Belgium). The post-tax discount rate reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks of the group of cash generating unit. The pre-tax discount rate is equal to 10,3% and 12,3% for respectively DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium. The outcome of a sensitivity analysis of a 100 basis point adverse change in key assumptions (lower growth rates or higher discount rates respectively) did not result in a materially different outcome of the impairment test for both DIY the Netherlands and DIY Belgium. Key assumptions in the cashflow projections are: - Growth rate aligned with HICP rate issued by the European Central Bank - WACC falls in the benchmark of comparable peer enterprises F-88 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). 2.1** **New and revised IFRSs affecting amounts reported and/or disclosures in the financial statements,1281.185.1,,"In the current year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and a new Interpretation issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after January 1, 2018. Amendments to IAS 12, ‘‘Income taxes’’: the amendments address the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses on debt instruments measured at fair value, as well as how deductible temporary differences should be measured in situations when tax law limits the offsetting of certain types of losses against specific sources of taxable profits. The application of these amendments does not have a significant effect on the results of the consolidated financial statements. Amendments to IAS 7, ‘‘Disclosure Initiative’’: the amendments require additional cash flow disclosures surrounding changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes arising from both cash flows and non-cash changes. The application of these amendments does not have a significant effect on the results of the consolidated financial statements, but they have resulted in additional disclosures in Note 18 on the changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). (Continued)",1281.187.1,,"The current distinction between operating and financing leases has been removed from IFRS 16. The standard requires us to recognize a ‘right of use’ asset, representing our right to use the underlying asset and a liability, representing our obligation to make lease payments, for almost all lease contracts. Short-term leases and low-value leases are exempted. The impact on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is that current operating expenses will be replaced by depreciation and interest; as a result, key metrics such as operating profit will change. Total expenses (depreciation for ‘right of use’ assets and interest on lease liabilities) are higher in the earlier years of a typical lease and lower in the later years, in comparison with current accounting for operating leases. The main impact on the statement of cash flows is higher cash flows from operating activities, since cash payments for the principal part of the lease liability are classified in the net cash flow from financing activities. Maxeda DIY Group B.V. will apply IFRS 16 as of February 1, 2019 and intends to apply the cumulative catch up method, applying IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes, in Accounting estimates and Errors’. A project team has been formed, which is currently investigating the impact of IFRS 16. IFRIC 22, ‘‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’’: IFRIC 22 clarifies how to determine the date of transaction for the exchange rate to be used on initial recognition of a related asset, expense or income when an entity pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign currencydenominated contracts. IFRIC 22 applies prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company does not anticipate that the application of IFRIC 22 will have a significant effect on the future consolidated financial statements. Amendments to IAS 40, ‘‘Transfers of Investment Property’’: the amendments to IAS 40 were made to clarify that transfers to, or from, investment property can only be made if there has been a change in use that is supported by evidence. The amendments to IAS 40 apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company does not anticipate that the application of these amendments to IAS 40 will have a significant effect on future consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; - Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. extent that it relates to bringing the inventories to the location and condition ready for sale.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other intangible assets are amortised over 3 - 5 years. flows. Individual stores are considered to be separate groups of cash-generating units for impairment testing purposes. Financial assets are assessed for impairment on an investment-by-investment basis. When an impairment is identified, the carrying value of the assets is written-down to their recoverable amount. The estimated fair value of trade and other receivables is approximately the same as the book value because of the short-term nature of these instruments and as recoverability is taken into account if necessary. When appropriate an allowance for doubtful debts is recorded. Also refer to note 16. Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade and other payables) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or when they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss. Derivative financial instruments All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the fair value remeasurement are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as fair value gains (losses) on financial instruments. Loans and short-term borrowings Loans and short-term borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received, which represents fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans and short-term borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.",N/A,as_expected,2020,464

All other leases are classified as operating leases. Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at the lower of their fair value at the inception of the lease or at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation in order to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to profit or loss. Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.

Supplier rebates relating to inventories purchased but still held at the balance sheet date are deducted from the carrying value so that the cost of inventories is recorded net of applicable rebates.

Other intangible assets Other intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
